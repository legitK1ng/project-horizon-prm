Well, I didn't find out until like 10 minutes ago when Ella snapped me and said that she was in the hospital so I was just like confused and then it took it it took her like 10 minutes for her to even tell me what happened and then she's like someone laced my weed and I'm like, bro, you're a dumbass. Like it was it was it was like bound to happen and then it's like it's she's just stupid for it. Yeah, that is kind of what we we assumed was the case from like when we first heard what was going on. Yeah. When did you when did you first hear what happened like tell me what what what happened like what what you heard? She was in the gym or no, I don't even know if she was in the gym or not, but now let's look at the transcripts. Yeah, she called me at 1130 at 1130 and I see what she said. Yeah, so I mean, we want to let you know what was going on basically she passed out or fainted and you know, I guess it was significant enough that you know teachers and staff got like involved and she wasn't like very responsive right away so they decided to have her transported like they tried to call Kiana and they got a hold of her but like she can is like an hour and a half away or she was at the time. Yes, I'm pretty sure she was dropping Corey off. Yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah, she was dropping Corey off. And then when all that she got that call, she he just ended up coming back with her anyways. Um, interesting. But yeah, I guess like, we, we kind of like first assumed like I mean, when somebody faints, I mean, it's only so many things that I could be. I was like, you're not like been eating lately or feel like not drinking water at all. Because like, I can see like that. That's like, that shit happens when you're like, kind of low on any of those things and you're like working out. You can find like veins. But then, I don't know, we're like, yeah, naturally, like, it was likely that she probably just smoked some weed and with somebody and, and, you know, got too fucked up. Right. How did she even like? How did? Well, I mean, I guess that's how she found out it was laced. I mean, she fainted, but like, like, what even happened? So she fainted. Teachers were like, checking on her, and she wasn't super responsive. So they're like, okay, let's get her to a hospital. And then, like, is that basically it? Yeah. They called mom to have her come and get her. But when they found out that mom wasn't going to be like, read it, like, readily available right now. And like, since she wasn't responsive, they decided to just have her brought there in an ambulance. And, uh, and I guess at some point between here and oh, and I think Kiana did send somebody to go pick her up. But I don't know, it sounded like a cat name. Whoever. Hello. Yeah, yeah, she sounds like a like a brindle or something. I don't know, some sort of dog or cat. But anyways. I mean, have you and mom talked at all? I mean, like, what does this mean for Ella? Um, I don't know. Like, I see, like, it like, told somebody like, well, yeah, so I was gonna say that so since mom wasn't available to go pick her up, and I think the guidance counselor ended up riding with her to the hospital. So, you know, she wasn't like by herself. Yeah. And yeah, that's about all I got. Yeah, I'm not really super big on I told you so is because I think they're kind of offensive. But yeah, I know that I'm big on I told you so is I thought I told I told Ella like, like, you're a dumbass and it was bound to happen. I'm pretty sure I had this exact talk with her, maybe like two or three weeks ago. And I'm like, if you guys like keep doing this, like eventually someone's going to give you laced shit, and then you're going to end up like, so like something bad's gonna happen. I like, I don't. I mean, like, what I kind of meant by like, what? Like, what does this mean for Ella? I kind of meant in terms of like, have you and mom talked about, like having her move back up with you guys? Or like her going online down here? I don't know, me and mom talked the other day about like, potential changes. And this thing is that, like, our thing is that we're willing to change and things that we want to, like, improve on and stuff like that. But yeah, that's as far as the conversation got. I was like, basically, I called her the other day. And I told her, I was like, Yeah, I think I'm going to be coming to get the kids the next time I see him. And he's like, why? Why do you say that? We talked about it. And we're fine. Basically, we're going to communicate better than we have been. Because mom hasn't really, I don't know, mom hasn't really used me as an asset as of lately, which is a problem for me. Right. But as far as we got. Right, right. I think it would be beneficial to have another conversation with mom after we get Ella all situated about what to do with Ella. Because I think it's kind of obvious school isn't really working out. I mean, like, as well as we hoped. I mean, Ella told me that she's going online. And I'm like, um, okay. I don't really know if that's something she talked to you guys about. Or if you guys have even talked to her at all. Right. Is Gabby with you? No. Nope. Where are you right now? Driving my way to work. Hmm. Are you going to St. Cloud? Yeah. I see. I might have to go to the city is like, tonight or tomorrow. I'm not sure why. Are you asking me why, as in why? Why do I want to know? Yeah, I know. I was what do you got going on? Um, nothing much, I guess. I mean, I don't know. I'm kind of I've kind of been talking to people and, you know, I'm not sure why, but I'm not sure what's going on. I don't know. I I'm I've kind of been talking to people and trying to figure out if I have plans this weekend, and it kind of seems like I don't, but I think if I don't this weekend, I might have, I might do next weekend. Next weekend. What are you talking about? With like with like Brandon and Vega and Vega's boyfriend and like Brandon's friend group type of thing. Yeah. When was the last time you seen them? Like, it was like two weeks ago or something. Yeah, yeah, I think I've seen them all. Well, not last week. I found out that I was driving home from work one night and I seen some like blue car like in the ditch, which is not like, you know, super like like a big deal. But it was like that first night that it was like just extremely cold. It was like, I don't know, like 18 below or 20 below or some shit like that. It was like 22 below down here. Yeah. Well, I was driving home from work one night and I think it was about like 11 o'clock. I was leaving the area and I seen this blue fucking car in the ditch probably like 30 feet off the road and like it didn't have anybody around it, but like it had like a left like the left blinker was like just blinking. And yeah, I don't know. It was one of those scenarios where like I considered like stopping and like going and checking on the person. But then like I figured like, OK, well, maybe like they already got helps and they're like, you know, already been picked up and they just abandoned the car. But just to be safe, I called 9-1-1 and I just kept driving because I had just seen a cop like I just passed a cop probably like a half mile back and I told him, yeah, like, you know, somebody is on the side of the road, you know, you might not sure if they got help, you know, go check it out, whatever. And they're like, OK, yeah, no, they'll do that. And then and then the next day I'm going about my day like regular and one of my clients sits down in my car and he's like, my nephew just was just found dead. And I'm like, oh, shit, like I'm sorry to hear that. And and he's like, yeah, he froze to death and full and they found him like in the woods, like frozen to death right in Foley. I was like right in Foley like that's you mean like right after 23? He's like, yeah. And I couldn't get really much details at the time, but that's when I was like, dude, I seen a vehicle in the ditch last night and called the cops when I seen. And yeah, basically, we found out I found out more of the story since then. But I guess like his nephew and his girlfriend were someplace, I don't know if they're at home or at a party or something like that, but they were drinking and they all like, well, he him and his girlfriend decided to leave despite everybody telling him not to that he'd been drinking and they left anyways. And what I found out later is that they, you know, he got he went off the road and he couldn't get himself out of there. Of course, but the girlfriend ended up like getting out of the car and, you know, walking a little ways before and somebody came and picked her up. And so basically, she left him at the car. And then I think he eventually tried to do the same thing, but nobody ever picked him up. And yeah, that's yeah, pretty much it. I'm going to his funeral on a couple of days. Yeah, I mean, I bet the girlfriend feels like horrible, right? Yeah, I mean, she probably feels like she like left him to die. Yeah. But like, I feel like in like a time like that. I mean, she had to probably think that the same thing was going to happen to him. Like he was going to end up getting picked up also. Yeah, I'm really no telling like the dynamic that might have been going on. Like he may have been like fucking basically, he could have been like borderline toxic and abusive and verbally abusive. And I don't know, maybe she was just trying to get away. Like shouldn't have fucking left in the first place. And I don't know. But yeah, I don't know. Everybody that's kind of like a part of it, I guess it's kind of like, I don't know. I was questioned her even like somebody gave me a couple of questions. Like, what did you think? Did you think to stop or anything like that? And I was like, well, no, I didn't stop. But because I just passed a cop. And so I called 911. Yeah, but yeah. Yeah, I mean, they're pretty much especially if there's one thing that law enforcement is prepared to do on the night, on nights like those, it's going to rescue people. Yeah. So yeah, I don't know. Yeah, like, I guess that makes sense. I'm like, confused and like, I don't know, I think well, in terms of like Ella's situation, I think it's kind of like, I don't want to say self-inflicted, but you know what I'm getting at, hopefully. Right, right, and, you know, honestly, I feel like there's, there should be like some room for room for fucking error, like just because somebody like messes up, doesn't necessarily mean that we should like switch schools and move. Right. I feel like we should like talk to her. I think that if we talk to her and kind of just like, explain to her that it like, it's okay to make mistakes. But if you've been doing it longer than just like, to do it, then it's okay to make mistakes. And I think that's a good thing. But if you've been doing it longer than just like today, then I think it's important for like her to tell you guys. Like, I think if today has just been like a one day kind of slip up and that she's been clean up until now, and her stuff just so happened to be laced today. I think like, yeah, that's like, okay, so it was just a mess up and it was a bad time for a mess up. I think that's like important to kind of differentiate. I suppose. Yeah, I don't know what to fully do. I'm gonna have to think about it and kind of, because I don't know. You know, wisdom is the best wisdom. Are her grades good? Are you asking me if her grades are good? Yeah, I don't want to say yes, because I'm pretty sure the last time we talked about grades, she was failing like three classes. I think, I don't fully remember, but I think she was failing something. I don't remember how many or which, or I don't know. I feel like that should be something you're able to look at, though, like on the Skyward app, you're able to look at Ella's account and see her grades and stuff. I'm sure they're probably posted by now, yeah. Yeah, at Ashton's, I was able to get a bunch of her, all of her late assignments, like a printout of it. Yeah. I think, well, mom's at the hospital now, so I think it would be a good idea for, if before you get to work, to just maybe call one of the two of them. Why don't you just try a three-way call on her? Okay, I can add mom. Here, hold on, I'm going to put, okay, you're in a three-way right now with dad. Okay, hey, I was just about to call you. I just, I'm talking to Ella right now. But hold on, I'll put you on speaker so then you can talk to her too. All right, the dad, Ava, is on the phone. Oh no. Say hi. I know I told you this over text, but I don't, this is, this is kind of like one of those situations where it's like important for us to know that if this is like a one-time mess up or if you've been doing it longer than just now. Ava. Yeah, I appreciate your concern, but I think for now, just be her sister right now, okay? Yeah, yeah. I know you care and you're just worried about her like we are, but I think she just needs you to be there for her right now. This is a parole violation. I'm just kidding. Hold on, hold on, I thought that was a cop, but dad sounded like a fed. Dad sounded like a fed. So we're here. She's doing okay, like she's, all her vitals and everything are like normal. I think they're waiting for like some tests to come back for see what was in her system, but I don't think it was just weed from what she's, she was like hallucinating and like, yeah, her pupils are the size of saucers. And she's still definitely out of it right now. Yeah, she just keeps laughing and I know she's, this is just kind of crazy, but she can't even stop. It's crazy. Ella. Right. But yeah, her counselor was here until I got here and then they left. And I asked her, I'm going to be calling the school tomorrow and setting up an appointment to meet with her counselor. And I don't know, maybe we can do it through zoom for you, Brandon, to be there as well. And just kind of see if we can get on the same page and talk about these bathroom situations and all that. And just, yeah, there's some stuff going on there that we need to all discuss, but I think me and you should probably talk later tonight. I'm not going into work tonight. I already called off. So I'll be here with her. Are you okay? You're twitching. Um, do you have anything you want to say to her, Brandon? Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're okay, Ella. You know, I love you. I'm sorry that this sort of thing has to happen. I know it can be very traumatic and I just know that we're here for you and we love you and I hope that you get better. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to be completely honest right now. I don't, I didn't understand a single thing that she just said. Yeah. Just said something about TP. She said something about CC pizzeria. That she was telling me that she wanted to dab me up or something. I thought she was talking about like toilet paper abbreviated. Yeah, I don't know. So we're here. I'm going to, what time is it? I'm probably going to see if Akalo can just pick up Ashton from school if we're not done here. Because she said she would, like just to keep her updated and she'll pick her up, pick up Ashton if she need be. I talked to Ashton already too. She like knows what's going on and she was crying at first, a little scared, but I told her everything's okay and that Ella's going to be fine. Yeah, Ashton texted me and she's like Ava and I texted her back and I'm like, like, hmm, like what's up? And she didn't text me back. So yeah, that's when Ella texted me and she said that she was in the hospital and I'm like, um, okay. So I'm a little confused. And then Ella said that someone, Ella said this really weird. She said someone laced her weed. Not even laced, leased her weed. Sold it to her? Yeah, she said someone. Like she rented it? Someone leased it? Yeah, she's renting it out. She said, I leased on my weed. Yeah, I don't think she pulled someone laced her weed. And she said, yes, gang. So when I didn't get enough answers, that's when I decided, well, I tried to call Gabby and I'm like, I was, I tried to call Gabby first because I thought maybe dad talked to Gabby and then Gabby didn't answer me. So then I called dad. Yeah, I would have called you, but I was on the phone between dad, the school, the hospital, Kahlo, my work, trying to like get all this stuff sorted out. So I just, I knew that somebody would talk to you. Can we do a video call quick? Yeah, this would be a lot easier if you just had an iPhone. Well, just do that.","strategic_notes":"{\"title\":\"Emergency Hospitalization and Family Coordination for Ella\",\"summary\":\"Ella was transported to the hospital via ambulance after fainting at school due to suspected laced marijuana.

I'm gonna fucking send him a picture. Tyler. Zach. I mean... Oh, I was gonna say, I was like, who? Yeah, I was gonna say, you should, like, leave it at Zach's, because I feel like the only place we can really use it... Like, I mean, obviously we could go to any lake to use it, but he has fishing rods that we can actually use. Obviously, bro. Yes, yes. I gotcha. I mean, I just probably... Probably what I would've done anyways. Thank you for thinking of me. Thinking for me. I don't know what I would do without you. Oh my god. No, actually, what I do need to do, I'm gonna have to bring it into the middle area, and I want to spray it with that fucking... That fucking... That spray seal stuff that you put on shoes. What? Do you... Okay. There's some on the fridge. Why would you spray it with that stuff? Isn't that stuff, like, probably already, like, the material already like that? Like, it's not a material that... No, it's like a fucking material that you'd see, like, made out of, like... It's like canvas. It's canvas? Yeah, like the... You'll see. But it's an ice house. Yeah, it's an ice house. Yeah, so, like, as long as it is, basically, and as wide as it is, and it stands up, and it's probably about, like, I don't know, seven feet tall. Right? Because... Huh? It stands up, and it's about seven feet tall. But it's like, I don't know. You could probably put, like... I don't know. Probably, I'm not...

Get away from him. And then little baby keeps fucking trying to go on the fucking oven. Yeah. Yeah. Size of the utility closet. Like, the one inside the house, or the one in the middle area? No, like the... No, like the one across from our room. Yeah. Okay. I mean, probably a little wider, but, yeah, it's about that size. Okay. And it's made out of canvas. It's made... It's got, like... No, it's got two wood sides. Like, the end that has the door on it, and the end that's, like, on the back wall is wood. Wood. Yeah, and the bottom is wood, too. Okay.

Well, no, that's a heater, but an auger is the thing that cuts through the ice. Oh. Oh, is that what he needed, Zach? Yeah. Well, he... Yeah, he said that he needed one, but then he ended up buying one. This is, like, a brand new, like, nice one. Yeah. Oh. Hey, I need you to... Could you do my tap notes for me? I already got them all ready. Yeah, I guess you do it on the phone with me so I can ask you. Any questions that you don't need to ask me? Yes. Did you have a lot of appointments today? What? Did you have a lot of appointments today? I had three appointments. Oh, that's easy. And I already created them on there, so... And, like, put in the time.

Are you listening to me? Yeah. What you need to do is go, like, copy it and open up a Google Doc. And when you open... After the Google Docs open, like a blank one, right-click and then click the thing that says copy as markdown. Or paste as markdown. Um... I can't right-click on my computer. Yeah, you can. No, I can't. It's a double-tap. You want me to look it up about if I can right-click on your computer? Or is there a way to do it? Yeah, I mean, I know how to copy. Like, there's a way to copy stuff, but... Like, when you normally right-click, like, on a mouse or something, and a list pops up? That doesn't happen. What is that? Considered a MacBook? Yeah, using two fingers on the trackpad, holding the control key while clicking... Okay. You said paste... Paste as markdown. That's not an option. It just says paste, paste without formatting, format options, clear formatting. We typed format options, I guess. Paste as format options. Select all matching text. Uh, wait, okay. Change key insert link, suggest paste without... yeah. What? Can't I just paste it? Do you have the fucking Google guy in the top right corner? No, but why do I need to paste it in this certain way? What's the difference? You'll be able to look at it, like, it's gonna make... it's not gonna look so fucking, like, messy. I don't know what it looks like looking at on your thing. I mean, yeah, I guess, but I can just read it, I don't know, instead of wasting time trying to figure out how to fucking make it clear. I mean, basically, if you got the fucking GemII symbol in your top right corner of your Google Docs, like, you can copy and paste all of it into his little chat thing and tell him to just paste it as Markdown. It's making me get a membership. It's at Google. Check. How do I... best of Google AI in one membership. How do I just fucking try for free? Sign into your Google. I'm in my Google. What do you mean? Yeah, when I try to fucking... I'll just take your word for it. If you can read it, then that's fine. Here's... Wednesday shift overview total 730... what? Oh, that's, like, for all of your shifts? I was like, how are you with someone for 7 hours and 39 minutes? Right. Okay, Anthony... Okay, so... add... So, co-op time... today... timeframe... I think I need this bigger, if anything. I don't know why it's so small. That feels better. Okay. Alex, why are you so annoying? So, from 9.38... 9.38... duration... 1 hour and 26 minutes... Client, Anthony... Okay. Confirmed... What? What? Why is it... There we go. I was like, why the fuck is it being like that? 9.38... 1 hour and 26 minutes... Anthony... Confirmed... Save... Time add... Generation file... Show all... Okay... Okay...

And, no matter how much it is, like, it better last me longer than fucking one night. You fucking crackhead. You would. Make it last longer than one night? Because I'm not a fucking drug addict. I don't need a lot. What did I say about saying that? I don't know why you, like, said it so seriously. Alright, big bear. Calm down. You're so easily rage-baitable. You want me to get your mom on the phone? She'll fucking... she'll straighten this right out. I'll fucking do the... I'll do the same thing I do if anybody fucking tells them I bought them lunch, dude. I'll be like, I did what? Like... So, who is saying I did what now? I don't even know that person. I guess I'm just gonna have to show you the video, because it's way funnier. Like, I would never... that's you, whenever someone is trying to tell on you, and you're like, I'm Brandon Gillis, but I would never do that. So I don't know what they're talking about. Wow. Yeah! Arby's. No, no, no, no. Okay, so what is it for? Tell me that. For Anthony Bruner. Contact information for pending application the client believes is approved. For, like, a treatment place? Oh, yeah. A, B properties. Oh, A, B properties. Yeah, A slash B properties. That's how I should write it? A slash B properties? Yeah. For A slash B... A, B's... Yeah, you can put that in quotations, too, so that they don't think I'm being... So, for, quote, A slash B properties? Yeah. End quote? Yes. Assisted the client in procuring contact information for A, B properties to follow up on a pending application the client believes is approved. Okay. So that is housing or assistance, assisting with whatever, non-clinical recovery, advocacy? Yeah, all those things. And clients... The only thing it's not is, fucking, I didn't take the guy to a meeting, so you can't put, fucking, things of recovery, fucking blah, blah, blah. Right. Well, and I feel like client education, you didn't teach him anything. I don't know what client education is that, like, when you're, like, me and client talked about, like, different boundaries and fucking coping mechanisms that the client can use. Like, I feel like that would be client education, wouldn't it be? I don't know, if I was, like, filling out a job application and it's safe to say that he didn't know how to do some portion of that before I helped him. I guess that is. Okay, the client is demonstrating an increased commitment to the administrative side of his recovery by utilizing the office as a professional home base for vocational objectives. His focus on the A, B's, that says Abby's again, but A, B's, A, B properties application indicates proactive self-advocacy and a readiness to transition into stable employment. A, B properties application indicates. Are you watching that? What? Are you watching that on your fucking, like, tablet or something? I don't know what you're talking about. What? I don't even know what you're talking about. 12-15-86, okay, sign. Okay. Alright. I'm done with that one. Um, next. Um, next. Oh, one. Oh, six. The mask everyone loves, the icon printed on a billion posters and t-shirts, was never meant for two in common. It was stolen from someone else's, too. And the evidence was always there. We just didn't have the technology to see it until now. The icon that fooled the world. Next. Next. Um. Dr. Tanaka, watch your. We just didn't have the technology to see it until now. The icon that fooled the world. Why do you watch the most boring stuff? Yes. Wonderful things. The middle coffin is heavily inlaid in glass. Completely unlike the others, which are basically pure gold. Inside was a treasure hoard beyond imagination. Golden chariots, jeweled thrones, painted statues frozen mid-stride. But buried deep within three nested coffins lay the one object that would captivate humanity forever. The golden death mask. Think about this for a second. This thing weighs more than a bowling ball. 22 pounds of solid gold, inlaid with lapis lazuli and turquoise. With eyes of obsidian and quartz that seem to follow you across the room. The ancient Egyptians believed gold was the literal flesh of the gods. This mask wasn't a decoration. It was sacred technology designed to help the pharaoh's soul recognize its own body in the afterlife. Without it, his spirit would wander lost for eternity. On the back, they carved a spell from the book of the dead. Divine protection for the journey into darkness. For a century, the gold accepted this mask as the ultimate masterpiece of ancient Egypt. Flawless. Perfect. Note specifically that Henry King died at 19. But almost immediately, experts started noticing things they had never known. And the crazy part? The clues they would never hear. They were staring at us in the face the entire time. We just refused to sit down. Because if the clues were real, it meant everything we knew about this mask was false. It was a possibility. Here's what doesn't make sense. King Tut died suddenly. Probably from an infection after shattering his leg. Egyptian religious law was absolute. A pharaoh had to be mummified and buried in exactly 70 days. Not 71. Not 69. 70. Now, think about what that means. 70 days to carve an entire world into a single solid life cycle. 70 days to wield three elaborate claws that boast inside each other like fiction dolls. 70 days to gather thousands of burial artifacts. And 70 days to create a 22-pound solid gold mask with microscopic details, precious stone inlays, and hand-carved hieroglyphic spells. From scratch. For a death nobody saw coming. It's not that simple, though. The tomb itself screams rush job. It's tiny. Embarrassingly small compared to other pharaohs' tombs. Some of the wall paintings look unfinished, like the artists dropped their brushes and ran. The massive stone sarcophagus is chipped on the corners, as if panicked workers had to smash pieces off just to cram it in. And get this. When researchers examined the other treasures, many of them weren't made for Tut at all. Statues with faces that looked nothing like him. Jewelry designed for a woman's body. Coffins with names that had been hastily scraped off and re-carved. Then they looked at the mask again. Really looked. The ears were pierced. In ancient Egypt, that was a massive problem. Only children and women wore earrings. An adult male pharaoh on his sacred burial mask would never, under any circumstances, be depicted with pierced ears. The lobes of the ears, each shaped differently, are pierced for earrings. It violated everything they believed about kingship and the afterlife. Some researchers also noticed the face looked off. Too delicate. Almost feminine. And the gold on the face had a slightly different color than the rest of the headdress. A subtle reddish tint that shouldn't be there. If everything was cast at the same time. A terrifying theory began to form. What if, when Tut died unexpectedly, there was no mask ready? What if the priests racing the sacred 70-day deadline grabbed a mask from someone else's tomb, altered it just enough to pass, and stuck it on the boy king's mummy? That raised one question that would haunt Egyptology for decades. Whose face was the mask originally made for? The answer was obvious. Two obvious. You took Dakota all the way to Carlos? Yeah. The vanishing woman. Her name was Nefertiti. You've seen her face. That famous painted bust of the Lord. Where? I know it's fine. She was Tut's stepmother. There was an address on there. What? There was an address on there. Some scholars have begun to suggest that actually this may not belong to him at all. It may not have originally been made for Tut. I don't know. I don't know whose address that was. Then she vanished. Completely. Her experience never been found. Her mummy was never found. Would you fuckin' just do the note, please? Right, yeah. I have to go on a trip. Actually, I have to talk to Dakota and Edith Nefertiti, you know, like, three minutes ago. Okay. Okay. Bye. Let me know when they're done. No, I'm working on his right now. I'll stay on the phone until they're done. Okay. Don't want no loose ends. Yeah. Hi, residents. I'm good. Hi. Hi. I'm good. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good. How are you? I'm good.

So, it's not the water pump but man, you know what I was feeling like though since it was so damn cold outside, I don't see how I could have damaged anything because there's no light come on or nothing. Yeah. But that don't mean **** though anywhere, I guess. So, okay, so, 2012 Nissan Quest, are those any good? Uh 2012 Nissan Quest. Yeah, for $7000 and it's got 136 thousand miles on it.

Looks looks like a **** a solid price for Yeah, if it would have been, if it would have been cheaper than that, then I would have been suspicious. 7000 is **** it's a good price in. Yeah. If you're cheaper than you'd probably be paying for somebody's problem and you and that wouldn't be telling you about it, you know, right? And it's super clean too. So, I could probably get like another 100 thousand miles or two out of there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Nissan's any pretty good vehicles. Yeah. Yeah, they're yeah, they're alright. Like they're kind of sister vehicles to Hondas and Hondas last forever but you know, you know, oil change, keep it clean. Don't let your brother-in-law drive it. Yeah. Hey, man. Hey, I hope you always answer the phone, man. I've been trying to get in touch with you but you wasn't answering the phone. So, this one, uh what what can I do? I got it. Guess what? It's motherfuckers in 3 hours away in Des Moines, Iowa, man. You are? No, that's where the **** vehicle is that I want to go. In Des Moines, Iowa. That's a long **** drive. 3 hours. Yeah. Yeah. How are you? How are you going to get out there? You got like a family member bringing you or something? No, I ain't got no goddamn buddy, man. And my mother **** sons and them is weird as **** and I got that big **** comedy tour coming up starting in February. So, I definitely gotta and then guess what? I gotta drive. That's why I'm saying it's got six thousand miles on it already and I gotta take and drive from **** uh Minneapolis all the way from to on the thirteenth, I gotta be on Indianapolis, fourteenth, I gotta be in Cincinnati, Columbus on the fifteenth, then Philadelphia on the twentieth, twenty-first, Hampton, Virginia, then New York on the but see all those is all on the East Coast area. I'm going traveling straight down that way. So, I can't, you know what I'm saying? I'm not really going too bad on that but I was wondering, I get a car with them kind of miles on there. **** I'm going to hit two or 300 on that **** by the time I get back because I gotta go all the way from Louisville, Kentucky, all the way to Vegas Okay. Yeah. That **** finna have miles bro. So, there is a there is some concerns that common problems with that make and model and around that year like many miles and I don't know if you have like one of the those OBD scan tools or whatever. No, I ain't got one Well, so I guess the the timing chain is like a the kind of a big concern with these things and they're not like if you they're not oiled like every every 30000 miles like if the fluid isn't exchanged every 30000 miles then it can be like they can like slip and then they can fail and like and that's like kind of like equivalent to like having to redo like a like a head gas because you gotta tear like you gotta get down to like the **** like the heads where like you gotta take the whole top of the engine off is what I'm saying, I guess. Yeah. Which. Okay. That can be that can be bad. So, when you when you ask them, when you talk to them, be like, has this engine been as a timing chain been replaced? No, I think what I'm going to do, I'm going to just look for something in Minnesota. So, if some **** pop up, I'll go back to them. You know, I got a guy. He's he's actually, he's the best **** guy to buy purchase from in the entire state of Minnesota. Hands down. Oh, you do? Yeah, I started to ask you that. Where is that set? Uh he's his office is in Ramsey, Minnesota. His name is Antoine. Can you get this website for me? So, I can see what they got. Yup. Yup. Let me pull it up and he's texting to me. Yeah, I'll text him. Yeah, I did say that sometimes he like doesn't have it up to date and like because he goes to the auctions. He's just like, he's just like you and me. He's not like a big time **** but he's super successful like as far as like you know, a guy with a with a dealer's license because he goes to auctions and he purchases these vehicles for at like, you know, dealer price and then he turns around and he sells them and like he he got me like a **** awesome deal. He got me my truck for like probably that truck I've seen you in. Yeah, yeah. I've met you in. Yeah, he's the one that sold me that and I've. So, how many miles you got on your truck though? What is that? A suburban? Yeah, mine's got 290 miles, 290 thousand miles on it. How many was on there when you got it? 164. Okay. And so he sold it to you real cheap. Yeah, he sold it to me. I think I I paid for that thing for and and like you and with the amount of miles on there like he could have, he could have easily charged. Oh, what about your ass? Come and pick me up and take me over there. Some **** I'll pay. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we can talk about it. I I mean, I'm working right now at my first job. Okay. If you I can give you a call back as soon as I can do it is probably tomorrow after work. So, you're saying basically I'll take that **** suburban and I work that other **** you know.

That's what I mean. That's what I meant to say. But so you make it legit. Yeah. Make it, uh, make it would be, that'd be cool if we did that.

This is B&H. How may I help you? Hi, this is Vernon Gillis. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. Are you the lady I spoke with this morning? Or it might have been Brianna? Yeah, it might have been Brianna. I know she's currently off the phones right now. What can I help you with though? Well, she was gonna have a conversation with me and Matthew Marcellus. And I'm just following up with that right now. Now, would you be able to help me with that? Or do I gotta wait for her? No, I should be able to help you with that. Where are you calling from? My name is Brandon Gillis. I'm with Generation Hope. And I'm calling on behalf of Matthew Marcellus, who I actually need to get on the phone line right now. If I could put you on a brief hold. Okay. Okay, one second. Oh, hey, good morning. Hey, I'm gonna add that person to the call right quick. Is that okay with you? Yep. Okay. Okay, there we go. All right. So good morning. This is Brandon Gillis. I'm calling on behalf of Matthew Marcellus, who's on the phone now. Matthew, I got a brief. Brianna, I think this is on the phone or I'm sorry. Michelle. Michelle. Hi, this is Michelle with Partners Behavioral Health Care. This is Matthew. Yep. Hey, Matthew, how are you doing this morning? Not too bad. Not too bad. Okay. So I'm just calling. We have processed your comprehensive assessment. I am ready to get you scheduled for the St. Cloud location intake. Do you have your own residence? No. Have you contacted any housing? I think he had said earlier that he was actually decided to go with the St. Paul. Is that correct? St. Paul. Well, I still got housing here, but I thought that was going to be like something like that was going to be difficult to do. So I could provide you some contact information for housing. If you'd like. Let's see what I have here. I mean, there was an email sent out to us on like Friday, either Thursday or Friday, kind of showing like a bunch of those resources. But if I recall, she was telling us like basically Matt had to make a decision whether he wanted to be up here or down there. And I don't know if he talked to you guys in between then and now, but he's told me that he had interest in going down to the St. Paul area. Okay. Yeah. If he'd like to go to the St. Paul area, we can get him scheduled for that as well. Sorry, I'm having a little issues right now with my housing sheet. You're totally fine. I can't really pull up. So I can, if he's interested in the St. Paul location, I can email you guys some housing information. Okay. Yeah. What's a good email that I can send this to? You can send it to my email and then I'll make sure that he gets it. I'll forward it to him as well. And the email is L-E-G-I-T-G-I-L-L-E-S at L-I-B-E dot com. Okay. And also you can probably just CC him anyways. Like his email is, it's his last name and then his first name. And then it was a 055 or? Yeah. 055. Marcellus055 at gmail.com. Yeah. MarcellusMatthew055 at gmail.com. Okay. Perfect. I'll CC him there as well. Okay. Cool. Cool. And then, so what, so our next steps are, just so we're super clear, you want us to review the information on the, that you're just about to email us and then we need to call them and then follow back up with you guys? Or is what, yeah, maybe walk me through that. We can get them scheduled right now, if you'd like. Just so you let housing know this client is scheduled for an intake. All of, then after he's scheduled for his intake, they will request a copy for his comprehensive assessment to see if he does meet criteria. So all of that would be sent to the housing. All of that should be funded through insurance as well. So let's see, what day should we get him scheduled for? I can't answer that. That's Matthew. As soon as we can. I mean, as soon as tomorrow. Okay. Let's see here. So I do have an opening for tomorrow at 8 a.m. Not sure if you might need a little bit more time for housing. It's just, it just depends with all of them. They're all different. But I do have tomorrow available at 8 for the St. Paul location. And now that's for like a phone screening thing or. So this I'll do my phone screening right now. And then you'll be you'll be scheduled for a comprehensive assessment and then an intake. So when you say that, that'll be all in one. So that'll be all in one. Correct. And I'll have to go down to the St. Paul location. Yep. If you're doing in-person programming. Yes. And then you'll start programming that day. And this is the outpatient, right? Yep. Intensive outpatient. Okay. I mean, all right. And then is there like anything. So, like, specifically, like, I know that he did a CD assessment with you with sobriety first. And like, but when they sent out his assessment to another place, you know, we called that place and we did the phone intake over there, this place. And this lady, I don't know if they were like, I don't know, kind of weird there. And they're like, just super trying to get them in to go inpatient because of a money thing. I don't know. But like, is there certain things that he should say and should not say in order to, like, make. You know what he wants to happen. I don't know. So, I mean, I'm, I'm unsure with that. You just have to call housing and answer the questions, honestly, on the screening. And then. But. So they'll do their screening, but they are going to request a comprehensive assessment. So the one that we complete upon intake, they'll request that. And then if they meet the criteria. Then it'll be considered for the free state board and large. And if not, some have self pay. We do also have GRH. Group residential housing that the client and the assessor or counselor will have to send a professional statement of need and send it to the county. And then we'll just have to wait to hear back from the county. So, I'm, I'm, I'm curious as to, is there a place with, with lodging outings here in St. Cloud or no. And St. Cloud, it's a, it's a bit more tough. I think. No, not as much. No. Did you have more resources for the St. Paul location or contact information for St. Paul change place? You could try calling St. Cloud. Yeah. For St. Cloud, you could try calling change place. Okay. All right. All right. So, I think we're cool. You're going to do some sort of phone intake with him right now, then. I'll do a screening if he'd like to get scheduled for tomorrow at eight. I just don't know if that gives him time to contact housing. If he wants to do that. Some might have a waiting list, but we could schedule him for tomorrow at eight. If that works for you, Marcellus. Yeah, I'll need some kind of guarantee if I'm going to go down there. Okay. It's going to take me an hour and a half to get down there. Right. Say that one more time. It's going to take me an hour and a half to get down there. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Say that one more time. It's going to take me an hour and a half to get down there. Okay. If you want, we could get you on for January 28th at 11am. Seems more feasible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that gives us enough time to get housing figured out down there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that'll work. Let's see. They reject me for any reason, and then I don't know. I'm not sure if I would even have a way to come back up here. If you want to give Change Place a call first for the St. Cloud location. Yeah, that's where you originally want to stay. I could provide you contact info and an email. Okay. I could call them, but I think we should, you know, because I'll have a couple days either way then. So we'll do the screening now, and then we'll schedule for the thing in St. Paul on the 28th at 11. And then I'll see if Spray or if Change Place is available. If not, then I'll proceed with going to St. Paul. Alrighty then. Well, I'll email you housing information for St. Paul right now. Same with your referent. And then you're all set for 11 a.m. So just keep calling housing, and hopefully they have something available for you. Yeah. All right, perfect. Thank you. All right. Yep. All right. I'm going to do my screening on you here. What is your drug of choice and last date of use? Alcohol. And I was listed the other day. And your last date of use? The other weekend, so that was probably like... You're cutting out. Is that a weekend? Eight or nine. Yeah, like a little over a week ago. Okay. Do you have medical marijuana? No. Okay. I do also see that last date of use for marijuana was the 13th. So just keep in mind that if there's no medical marijuana, they will be watching for the levels to drop. Yep. Let's see here. Do you have any legal involvement? No. Any medications? No. And have you had any recent suicidal or homicidal ideation? No. Okay. Okay. All right, sir. Well, I will be sending you an email, same with your referent, with the date and time of your appointment, housing information, and our address. Sounds good. All right. Have a great rest of your day, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. All right. Hey, Matt. I'll probably catch up with you. I don't know what my schedule looks like today, but maybe I'll try to get you into the office today at some point. All right, man. All right. Take care. Sounds good. Bye.

No, I was having to do this. Let's do it right now, though. I was just wondering, because I meet with my CPS lady tomorrow or tomorrow or the next day. I don't know which one, but. Say the word again, family. Parenting classes. All of our parenting classes. OK, I see one, right? That's like. This course is referred to as parenting skills class. Child endangerment course child abuse class for court mandated parenting program. And I guess you got it. You got to pay like, so basically this, this looks like a court approved one. Like, I mean, you could do something different, but then I might tell you to do this anyways. So this course should not be considered as a divorce parenting class or coparenting course. I conflict parenting program. I don't like that. What do you think? Which one? So what do you want me to find you a couple different options and then send them to you? Yeah, would you? Yeah, yeah, I can do that. I don't know if I should do. I don't know if I want to do one that's like. I don't know if I want to do one that's like. So what do you want me to find you a couple different options and then send them to you? Yeah, would you? Yeah, yeah, I can do that. I don't know if I should do. I don't know if I want to do one that's on child endangerment or just a parenting one overall. You know what I mean? Like, I feel like the parenting one would be better because it's like, you know, like this wasn't something that I like intentionally did to endanger my child. It's not like intentional to put them in danger, but it's like more, you know, more something that like, you know, a parent like like that you would learn in a skills class and it would benefit you. Whereas, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, I mean. I'll just show you. I'll just show you what I find. But what are you going to be? I'm driving right now. But I'll look at them. I'll look at them tonight. Okay. When are you going to be home? I'm driving. I'll look at them tonight. Okay. All right. All right. All right. When are you going to be home? When are you going to be home? When are you getting off work or whatever you're doing? Well, I was supposed to be off at 8, but somebody's mom or something collapsed, and fucking they ran out of work and didn't even say anything. They ran out and called the store and said what happened. And so they said that they needed me to close tonight because of the other night, the other day when I called in for this stuff. They're like, listen, dude, we didn't write you up. We didn't even say anything about it other than ask you if you were okay. We need you right now. So I fucking I told him that I would do it, but I had to go bring my son because I left the baby with fucking somebody who can only watch him until 8 p.m. So I was like, look, I can do it, but I need to go bring my son somewhere where he can be until 1 a.m. And they were like, that's fine. That's fine. So I just now left to go. I just picked up the baby and now I'm on my way all the way to Circle Pine. That's so far. That's kind of far away. You could have called me and I would have gone and got him. Yeah, I don't know. I just started panicking because like I know that they did. They did. You know, they did fucking. That's fucked up, dude. I called. Nobody does. I know what he calls in on. If you close and you have to call in like two days before. Otherwise you're fucked. You know, right. So nobody. Yeah. It's bad. You call in on a close and you're definitely getting written up. And I called in like literally an hour before my shift. And like, they didn't even give him an option. I'm just like, look, I'm not coming in. So I fucking I, I figured when this happened, it was a perfect opportunity to kind of like, you know, get my, you know, one up on him. So that way we're even again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you do work till close tonight then. Yeah. But we're off. It's not 2 a.m. It's one. Oh, okay. And then after work, I got to drive all the way to fucking circle pines. Damn. Okay. That's crazy. I know I'm pissed. I'm not going to make nothing tonight. My, my, at the end of the night, you need my tips between my tips and my fucking mileage that they gave me back or whatever. And my hourly dude, like break even because I just had to pay two babysitters now and I had to drive all the way to fucking circle pines from new hope and back and then do it again in a couple hours. Yeah. Like I'm not going to make a shit tonight. But whatever. Yeah. Prostitute prevention. Sorry. Okay. I'm going to finish reading this and I'll send it to you. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. All right.

go give somebody a ride that was near me are you guys coming here no i don't think so i don't think anybody why i don't know fucking everybody over there's got some fucking stick up their ass apparently except for cory cory's too cool i do not have a stick up my ass yeah you clearly do whatever i fucking tried calling you last night your fucking phone's not even on sure sure what i don't know yeah my maximum effort i don't know i guess i just don't really have a very good mood about it um i don't know not just that there's other things and um i don't know when i do come out there i don't think anybody's gonna like what i have to say what do you mean well i'm pretty fucking confident that like there could be some immediate change like either all the girls come back here or one or two of them or something but i don't know your your content uh as of late has been like not there anymore so i mean you said just yourself the other day that you're fucking your stress level is fucking super high and you're not feeling good and all that shit and i understand and i i've already think you do a good enough job i just want to find a balance that is going to work for everybody because so because you aren't happy with my level of course you're just gonna decide like make some executive decision that the kids aren't living here anymore um like i don't think that's fair or at all well what i don't think is fair is me like sending the girls over there to you and it's supposed to be like we're looking for like a better solution for things and then like they've gotten like 60 fucking like charties like absences ashton hasn't completed a single assignment the entire year and i asked her if you've helped her at all and she she didn't answer me so i'm assuming that's a no when i ask the kids if they have homework and they tell me no when i bring them to school every day like i can't what am i supposed to go to school with them and fall this is the thing is like you can't do everything on your own you can't do everything on your own and i understand that you're doing a great job and you're doing the best you can but like you're not using me at all to like to like three hours away you think that fucking mattered at all when like you were the other way around you i made like a sincere active like effort to always like bring you into the picture have you part of conversations decisions like all these things and you just stopped giving a fuck that's not even true no you did and it's whatever you got shit going on apparently you're like you got but that's okay you honestly you have like been working your ass off and there's no doubt about that but i'm not saying like you're a piece of shit i'm just saying there needs to be a change because i'm seeing like the like from an administrative point of view this is not working brandon you do realize when the kids are with you you pick them up from school like every other day like you're acting like this is like some new thing the kids are not doing bad the kids are happy here like all right well we're gonna i don't know you're gonna something's gonna change something's gonna change so i'm sorry but you don't just get to you don't just get to make like some fucking executive decision on this like the kids are old enough to decide where they want to live and like i'm not just not like you need to put your fucking grown-up pants on because yes you are don't fucking talk to me like that well you you realize what you just said i'm not going to make some executive decision no i would be making like a co-parent decision but you this is the first time you fucking called me and that's not true the entire time you've had them really this is the first time i've called you since i've had the kids yeah when was the last time you called and you were like hey what's going on like uh there's this going on we got this going on you've never fucking once called me for anything not not for a fucking dance not for choir not for conferences that is incorrect the first time they've had conferences since since they moved here was the week that they fucking started school was i supposed to go to conferences when they just started there the semester just ended on the 22nd that means they had to have had some sort of fucking conferences at some point well they did right after fucking school started when they started school here the reason i was so like easily to be like yeah you guys can go over to your mom's is because that's like the kind of mutual respect i feel like we have and i feel like if i were to have like said no i since you guys are actually technically in my custody and not hers like that's not gonna happen if i were to said some shit like that that would have totally broken and i feel like you're violating my fucking trust by the actions that you've been doing lately brandon you act like i've been on some fucking vendetta against you last couple times i've talked to you i'm like dude what's wrong like are we cool like and you're like yeah no it was just one thing i mean at first it was one thing but uh i don't know dude you don't really have because the last couple times that we have had encounters you've been fucking rude and you've been like encounters you've been fucking rude and mean and you say these hurtful ass things and expect me just to be like you're right everything's cool sounds good like it's not gonna fucking happen i'm not just like okay so because of that that's the reason why you like basically cut me out of the fucking whole parent i haven't cut you out of anything brandon this whole one seems a little older but i think yeah and like the girl's fucking you know pissed off at me like this whole time and you've done what to fucking fix that for me nothing i talked that's fuck you brandon that's not even fair i fucking tell them like they need to fucking talk to you i tell them how important it is for them to fucking not hold grudges and that you're their father and that you love them and everything that you do is like you're trying your best and you're trying to be there for them like you can fucking ask them that but you yourself you just admitted to having a vendetta against me and not what i did not just say i have a vendetta against you don't fucking put words in my mouth well because you said that i've been an ass the last couple of times i've seen you that that's why you don't want to talk to me no that's not i'm telling you that yeah you do fucking say fucked up shit to me and i'm not okay with it i'm not cutting you out because of that i want you to know like honestly you're like one of my fucking closest and my fucking dearest my longest fucking friends i've ever had and i love you and i fucking i just think it's really unfair of you to like sit here and make these assumptions and say that i i don't fucking care i haven't done anything like i have and i talked to the kids about the shit that's been going on with you and i tell them you will you need to talk to your dad nothing's gonna fucking happen am i what am i supposed to like force them drive them up there fucking leave them with you in a fucking locked room so you can talk to them like you're the fucking one not coming fucking down here yeah i'm the last fucking three or four times i've been down there i drive we drive like six hours and like the girls so we drive down there last time and mind you it's like a six hour fucking drive round trip for all of us and like the girls get an attitude because you and fucking corey are drinking and they blame it all on me for drinking and i wasn't even i didn't even have a fucking single drink that night and then like so like i took the fucking complete heat for that shit and then like and i'm not fucking drinking anymore because of that because they don't like it that's fine like that's not what they were all thought like what the only issue was yeah no that's not the only issue i'm sorry buddy quite honestly like i feel like you're being slightly like irrational about this stuff well i'm not but i'm having a conversation what i'm just having a conversation with you i'm not freaking out i'm not yelling i'm talking about over the overall picture of everything brandon you're actually like this is like some fucking huge thing that's happened like it's not it's really not it's not that fucking serious that's what i'm saying too but yet the fucking girls are just i don't know i'm just i'm fine everything's going to be fine but i don't fucking feel like driving six hours for everybody to fucking give me a bunch of attitude and and us to have this conversation like yeah we need to have this conversation and i can't imagine it going it's fucking super splendid don't even think about it so and you know honest honest it's different though i think that after like everything like and after all these years like i feel like you fucking know better that like i am on your side when as far as it comes to the kids like i don't talk shit about you to the kids no matter how i feel about you and i don't always feel the best towards you because you're kind of a fucking dick sometimes but i always have your back so for you to like still make these assumptions that like i just what i'm over here fucking like throwing you under the bus or something that's not fair and i really it does hurt my feelings well you must not value my opinion that much i mean otherwise you probably would have fucking called me about i don't know something but i fucking did call you uh and i fucking have been not feeling great and that's not because of the kids here this would be fucking regarded like with without the kids if i could have struggled with this shit my whole fucking life and it doesn't mean that i just can't handle having them here i'm not saying that you can't handle the kids that you you know produced i'm not saying that i don't want them to leave we're gonna have to figure something out whether it's you fucking like but ultimately like you are you have a bunch to fucking chew on right now and you're doing a great job you don't necessarily fucking need to fill that space with like other things i'm here for you to like help you um yeah like we need to fucking co-parent like all right you look at like the way huh what do you want what is like just to make this better like what is it that you want me to do you want me to call you fucking every night want to have a chit chat every night no dude i want the girls fucking mental health fucking like up kept i want fucking the girls to get good grades i want them to not be fucking doing drugs and if they are doing drugs they better be getting good grades okay well they haven't been doing drugs well i don't know that the kids were also not getting good or like great grades when you were like i just feel like you kind of have a double standard here like you act like they you were just like little fucking angels up there and they've come down here and i'm just suddenly whatever like that's not true this conversation doesn't have to be like this i'm not fucking being all dramatic like that and i think you're taking everything doesn't have to be like that just calm down can i say something oh my god both of you yeah so anyways like i was having a conversation with the girls the other night you know and this is i know that's not a lot to talk about you guys might not know this um but they're you know like with the tardy thing um i think it could be fixed but it's like i know where they go and they go to the bathroom and they just go straight to the bathroom and they said the teachers don't go there and check and i i don't know maybe you guys want to talk talk to the school about that i don't know i don't know if that's gonna help you guys they do they just hang out in the bathroom i missed that's what they just told me that like the other day too and it's like i don't know what to do at that point because like i fucking get my ass up every morning make sure the fucking kids are at school on time like they're never i'm they're never late because we're late to school i've never once brought them late to school and it's like i can't like they need to be doing what they're supposed to be doing but like i can't follow them around class every day and i could maybe they would stop skipping class i don't know well yeah that's that's where they go so i don't know i mean the only way you're with the school you know i mean i think it's kind of weird that teachers don't go in there yeah all right yeah we can definitely talk to them about it and all that like i understand that it's an issue and they should you know i mean like yeah i don't know i know i know ava's passing all her classes but uh hello is not yeah well and i talked to ella about it like that too that was she both of the kids i was like if i if i didn't think that you guys were capable of getting better grades i wouldn't be like on you about it but the fact is is that you guys are both capable of doing either either have like all really good except one class yeah but the other two and i oh so she's helping science and i was like okay so when i come home and i ask you guys do you have homework or anything and you tell me no that's the time to say maybe mom i don't have homework but like i'm not understanding this like can you help me with it and like i will yeah she said that like she would start doing that and like letting me help her and so i mean like it's not like i'm just ignoring these things or if they had like after school tutoring classes i got a printout when i talked because i like talked to all their teachers on this on the app or whatever i was like because i like i don't know this is like a month ago and i got a printout of all the assignments from all the teachers so like i can give that shit to you so that you know like what's actually been handed out what's like what they i mean because i know taken and i don't i don't necessarily blame them because like when they get home they're like and you're asking like really do you got homework they might genuinely just not remember or not want to think about it but the truth is like if we have that paperwork that shows like okay let's fucking like sit down we got these fucking like we can knock out like four or five of these assignments real quick yeah i mean and you guys can do it like we can all fucking do it it's just like we need to be like working together and kind of using all of our resources because these kids are fucking snaky motherfuckers you know yeah yeah i agree like i'm not in the audience about yeah so i mean we got to use our fucking smart powers what ashton wants to do volleyball this next quarter and it's like a hundred dollars do you think you could split that with me yeah yeah hell yeah um yeah it's fucking really cold it's like fucking negative 14 i don't know maybe i don't know i don't know but like honestly i don't want to fucking have this tension with brandon well it doesn't have to be there we just need to fucking communicate like we're just not fucking saying anything about you doing a bad job i'm saying the opposite i'm saying you're overworked and you have like a like a huge workload and like there's no way that you're going to be able to accomplish that without us working together i mean if we work together and fucking nothing really has to change but like that's what needs to change is like we just need to actively be using our resources and communicating and keep working because if we're not then it's like fucking yeah that a house divided cannot stand well you know i was like i still do the stuff that like you whatever implemented like i the kids still like have to make sure that their rooms are clean on fridays like i have them helping out around the house and like you know like i'm not just like letting them fucking do whatever the fuck they feel like like i feel you're you're clearly feeling attacked and i apologize that wasn't my intention but we just i don't feel as much i just are you okay yeah listen i'm sorry kiana i

This is Brandon Gillis with Generation Hope. How are you doing? Great. How are you? I'm super busy over here. Yeah. So I'm actually I got Matt with me today right now and we're kind of playing a little bit of phone tag a little bit but my supervisor would kind of explain to me a little bit how we're trying to get him into change of place and we recently did the CD assessment over at Sobriety First. And I made sure that he did the ROI for between your guys' organization and Sobriety First and ours and Sobriety First. But my supervisor said in order to get change of place, change of place and take going that we should actually talk with you guys because you guys are somehow connected. To change place? Change of place. I can give you. Yeah, I mean, I can give you their phone number, their application. We can, you know, if it would be helpful, like this is for his last name's Marcellus. Yeah. Correct. Okay. We can I've processed his intake. So are his referral documents. So we'd be able to schedule him for intake if that's helpful for change place. Yeah. But, but it's you and the client will have to be the ones who are proactive to get him signed up. But we cannot, we can't do that for him. He has to do it based on like laws and everything. I think we'll change place right now. Like I think they're like, when we look at our housing, we're looking at, this is in St. Cloud, right? Yeah. St. Cloud is like a hard, hard area because there's a lot of housing going on there for like a lot of options. Let me see. So while you're, while you're doing that, maybe you explain how you guys, you are connected to the right or to change a place like this Heidi was kind of. Yeah. We just have them on our housing list. So like we don't, we, we are not connected, like not connected in any way to housing. Yeah. Not directly. Like we have a housing list and you know, like we, yeah, refer back and forth, you know what I mean? Like we have a context information but we, we, partners is not, does not work with, with change place. Cause I did all that the other day. You what? Yeah. They're online application. Okay. And you didn't hear back. Yeah. It looks like. So the Fernie and our housing team, they have reached out to change place just to see what their numbers are at. I know yesterday there was like two female beds open and zero male beds. The screen, the housing team reached out to them and they haven't heard back. The other options for St. Cloud, so is it only board and lodge that he can look for or like, cause I have housing list for GRH. I just don't know what he, like, would he qualify for GRH? Well, his CD assessment, maybe, maybe it could be a good, do you guys have that already? His CD assessments that says what he is approved for? I have to, so I have a sobriety first assessment. I just don't know. I don't know enough details. Like if I look at that, I don't like, I can give you, like I gave him the board and lodge stage place, but I do have housing list for GRH in St. Cloud, but I just don't know what he, if he qualifies for that. And I don't know if you've like tried to apply for that with him or if you know, know more than I do with the housing piece of it. Right. Yeah. We've been on GRH or anything. I guess he was looking for like, just like IOP, like a couple of days a week. And then something that would also kind of help put them in like a sober living situation for however long that programming lasts. The other, the other, so he filled out an application with Change Place, is that correct? Yeah. Right. And, and does he have to stay in St. Cloud? No, no, you can go wherever. If he were willing to come to the cities, I'm probably there. We have a lot more access to resources for housing resources. We have a men's campus, you know, in St. Paul or one in Minneapolis that has available spots. If, if maybe he'd be willing to come to the cities. Okay. Like, Yeah, we would definitely be open for, to hear what availabilities are out there. Yeah. So let me, can I send you a housing list for the cities? And then if you want to figure, try calling those places here. And then we, because we got him scheduled, I can get him an intake here very quickly, like in, at the men's campus or, or Minneapolis campus. I just, you know, with the, the housing, you need that secured housing. You're not going to go to, if you don't have somewhere to live, right. Let's see. So the number, I can send you an email. I look, looks like I have legit gills at live.com. Yeah. Legit Gillis. That's the right one. Yeah. Yep. So I can send you a housing list. Another number I was given this morning for St. Cloud, because I was having the same issue with some deals, was, it's called Victoria Plus Housing Home. I, we're not a hundred percent sure what their, what their funding is, but, so if you go to the website, if you just Google Victoria Plus Housing St. Cloud, and then I have their phone number, it's 320-471-8912. Damn, that was fast. Say it again. Oh, sorry. So Victoria Plus' phone number is 320-471-8912. Eight, nine. But I, I'm not, yeah, eight, nine, one, two. I'm not sure what, what their, their pay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And so this is where I find them. They're funding it. And then the other place that I was shared with, which is dream center, which is when I look at the website looks a little more like a shelter to me. But those are the three I have for St. Cloud, but yeah, if he's willing to come to the Twin location, I can provide you with board and lodging. So that sounds like you've got a lot of information in front of you and that's super helpful. If you can put that all in an email and then kind of just simplify things for me, like, so do we need to find one of those places first and then get back to you and then you get us on into the intake process or can we do one the other way around where we start with you and then later, well, the decision versus is whether, like, if he can come to the cities, you know, like that, that opens up a bunch of spots, right? Like I could schedule him and take call to get him an intake today or tomorrow. But if he doesn't have somewhere to live, like that's not going to be helpful, right? And then he would have to do another, if he ended up coming to the cities, he'd have to do another intake. So I guess like focusing on which area, like where, like I could do an intake either in St. Cloud or, or St. Paul or Minneapolis, I just need to confirm which location he wants to be at. Okay. So if, if it's more, if, if you want to call this afternoon for these, these, those housing that I'm going to send you in the cities and then you're like, yeah, he can come to cities and you know, we can go that route. I get it. Yeah. So if you could actually put it all that in an email, because he's communicated with me that he can't make a decision right this second, he needs to discuss it with his partner. So yeah. Okay. An email. Yeah. Yeah. Like less than an hour. Yeah. And then I also, you know, like I, that will change place, like even if they are full, like I like to be put on a, maybe on a wait list, like things change super fast and so for houses. Right. So I don't like, it might just be the day they might have opening throw. I don't, I don't know. It's kind of, you know, kind of up in the air, but let me, I'll send you an email. I'll send you an email and give you all that information. And then kind of, then Matthew, yeah, I can talk to a partner about it and see what the best route is. I just want to make sure that he's safe right now when that he, well, he figures this out what he wants to do. Well, I figured we'd look in the same cloud. That's, I'm already here. So it's like Jamia makes more sense. We'll figure out where they have availability. Okay. If they can get me in right away, that we can, we can get him, give me in right away. If there has to be a wait, we'll, we'll, we'll, you know, have to determine, can I wait? Right. Can I wait? Or could I, or do I have to go down to the cities? I'll talk to them. Yeah. Okay. I'll talk to my partner today and see what, see what she wants to do because she's down in the cities right now. So. Oh, that might be, that might be perfect for you. We'll, we'll see. Cause I know she wanted to come up here, but I just don't want to be like, you know what I mean? Yeah. One of those things. Okay. Yeah. So I can, is it better for me to email you or email Brandon? Probably Brandon. Brandon will be keeping the reins on this for right now. And then, yeah, we're working together on it. So. Okay. All right. All right. I'll send that stuff over. You and I, right? Like a gen hoping and you're in partners. Do we have an ROI already set up or do you want to add to the email? For partners? I, with Generation Hope, that's a good question. Let me look. Yeah. Cause I know if we don't have one set up yet, like we're going to need one. So if you throw that in an email as well. Right. Right. Actually, the thing is, cause you referred him. So it makes it a little bit more like, that's why I'm able to talk. Let's see though. Otherwise I can have my intake lady get in touch with you. I mean, that's, that would be. Yeah. Or, I mean, I kind of send it to you by email too, to have you sign. But I think. Yeah. Yeah. Let me, let me take a look. What I have on. Yeah. Cause we're able to coordinate until basically after your intake. Like that's just because you were referred in the hot spot. Yeah. Yeah. We have one. We have one with, with Aaron from sobriety first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. We can eventually have one that, but like, because what it's just. What we're doing is just that, you know, we're not really exchanging any information. You know what I mean? Like we're okay for the moment. Before the ROI. You just. Once, once, like, let's say you have your intake and you do your assessment and if you wanted Brandon to get a copy of it and stuff like that, that's when we would need the ROI. Okay. All right. Well, great. Okay. I'll drop that and get it out to you. Okay. Okay. I'll be watching. Thank you. Okay. Thanks.

We just want to know your story behind it, like what happened. The only thing that happened was I was closing the door behind me. And the person's hand got caught in between the door. Because they're trying to stop me from shutting the door. And I didn't realize it until they already booked me. Okay. So, I mean, that's essentially what happened. That's the reason why. I just planned to do it anyway because I was already trying to find a different case at that time. So, but yeah, that's essentially what happened. Oh, okay. So, why is this thing? Incendiary device, what is that? Is that like the door is what they mean by that? Probably the door, yeah. Incendiary device? Incendiary device, I don't know. Oh, like blowing up. Is that what the? No, there's no. Fire. That's right. There's no, there's no explosives or anything involved in that case. All right, then. So, do you have time so we can do a quick phone screening with you? Absolutely. Yeah, this is that time. So, I'm going to get Katrina to just ask a couple of questions. I'm right next to her. So, it's just training here. And she can take over. We just needed to ask that. Okay. All right. She is ready. Okay. Have you ever been an employee of Narsha Regional? No. Do you have any family members currently in programming with Narsha Regional? No. For insurance purposes, what is your social security number? 468215679. And which location would you prefer to go to? What's the nearest one? Otsego. Otsego. And looks like there's a packing limitation of one bag and one backpack. Do you agree to this? But as long as I can keep it in the vehicle, I guess that wouldn't matter. Right. This is for outpatient programming, right? This is residential. Okay. Yeah, I think our recommendation was for an outpatient program. No problem. You guys do have an outpatient program, right? Yes. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. Okay. Do we need to speak to a different intake person for that? No, you're fine. We do both. So, what is your chemical use of choice? Alcohol. When was the last time you drank? This past weekend. Last weekend? Yeah. Was it on Saturday or Sunday? Sunday. Okay. Any other substances? THC. When was the last day to use? About three days ago, four days ago. Was that Monday or Sunday? Monday. How did you use it? Just a bowl. Any other substances? No. Do you have any allergies? Sorry, what was that? Do you have any allergies? No. Do you have any dietary restrictions? No. Are you able to climb stairs? Yes. Do you use any mobility devices? No. Do you use any medical devices? No. Do you have any history of seizures? No. Do you have any history of overdose? No. Are you taking any medication? I am, but I won't be bringing them with me.

No. Are you your own legal guardian? Yes. Do you use any alcohol monitoring devices? No. Do you use any GPS monitoring device? No. Okay. Okay, Matthew, it's Lydia again. I'm over here. So due to, I know you want to do IOP with lodging, but due to your last date of use, your insurance will not be able to cover it. So you do qualify for the residential treatment. All right. Is that okay with you? Are you willing to go to the residential treatment program? I think that as long as we do the phone treatment, phone screening for today, because we did have some other people that we had to follow up with. We did have a couple of other questions for you as well. Okay. What is the question? So just to summarize, so you said that based on the answers that he gave you today, you think that he would not be eligible for an outpatient program, but he would be inpatient? Yeah, for residential, that's correct. Okay. All right. My next question would be, you guys did receive the CD assessment from sobriety first? It looks like from what I'm looking at in this year, we have not received it yet. Was it sent today? It would have been sent on Friday. It would have been sent Friday. I don't know how you guys usually send them out to you if it's like fax or email, but they did automatically send it to you already. We can send you a copy right now if that would be helpful at all. Perfect. If you could do that, that would be great. We have a fax number or email as well. Okay. What is a good email for you guys? Yeah, email would be best. And also, if you could send an R01 so that we could speak with, my organization can speak with you guys in regards to Matt. Perfect. Yeah, so usually once he admits, he signs all the forms from you guys. Since you guys are referring him to us, we will have that document ready for you guys, and then we can put it on there. And whenever you guys need to speak to him or speak to the counselor, we'll be able to release this information to you. I have an email whenever you're ready. Yeah, go ahead. Okay. Email is admission. So, A-G-M-I-S-S-I-O-N-S at northstarregional.com. So, N-O-R-T-H-S-T-A-R-E-G-I-O-N-A-L.com. Regional.com? Yes, that's correct. Regional.com? Mm-hmm. Okay. One second. Let me put you on just a brief hold, and I can send that over to you. Okay. And I'm speaking to Brian, right? Brandon. Yeah. Brandon? Yeah, Brandon. Generation Hope. Okay. Generation Hope. Okay. And Generation Hope, is that like a sober house or just curious? Generation Hope is an RCO. It's a recovery community organization. We're based all over Minnesota. We have an office in Minneapolis and then St. Cloud and a couple of others throughout the state. But we're mainly an organization that offers certified CPRS services. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Awesome. Oh, yeah. So while we're doing that, we do have a couple other questions while I'm pointing and clicking and things are loading. Okay. So assuming that we ΓÇô well, once we do get that recommendation over to you, in that outpatient program, he had some questions about, like, the rules and some of, like, what's allowed and just kind of safeguard himself from potentially breaking rules or, I don't know, he doesn't want to set himself up for failure. So he was asking questions about, like, what your guys' policy is on having his vehicle there and, like, does it matter whose name it is in and, like, what that sort of ΓÇô some of those information like that. Okay. So once he arrives at the facility, there is a parking space where he can go and park. So everybody at the reception area, they will tell him exactly how to ΓÇô where to park and everything. Most of the rules is just to make sure that you follow, make sure you attend all the programs. The rules are just easy. Main focus is just attend the program when we have them. And then you do have individual session. You have group sessions as well. There is, at that vehicle, there is a gym where there's, like, downtime as well. So just make sure you bring things to keep you busy, sketchbook. They have a gym, other things just to keep you busy. But the rules, I feel like it's just straightforward. And everything. And they will have all of those information for you to sign up. And at the end of the day, that is on you. So we can't have our phone with us? Is that something you guys take? You will ΓÇô yeah, so you can take your phone, but you cannot use your phone during the sessions. So it will be kept away for its own safety, because you are there with other guys there as well. So whenever you need your phone, you just need to ask a counselor and then we get that. Do you guys do, like, store runs or anything like that? Because if I need to, like, go to, like, Walmart. Yes, we do have store runs, yes. Okay. Yes, they do have store runs where they get everybody to go. Well, not everybody, but particular people to go to the store, like gas stations and other places to get what they need. Okay. And you guys don't require, like, proof of insurance or anything like that on the vehicle? Or can you just keep it on the lot? Insurance? Right. Insurance. No, not that I know of. That has not been a problem for us. Okay. Any other questions? No, that's it. So do you actually ΓÇô so does the program, is it just a couple of days out of the week and then he's free to go? Or how does ΓÇô it's like every day? You're going to be there ΓÇô it goes up to six weeks of program. It goes up to six weeks. So depending on how well you're doing, you can graduate earlier. And if you want to continue, that's when they will put you on the list for IOP with lodging. And the IOP with lodging, that goes up to nine weeks with three phases each, which is like three weeks each phase. And once you graduate from that and you want to go for a sober home or just, like, be in the community and go IOP, straight IOP, you can do that as well. So it keeps going, you know, so it's like a step down. So you graduate from this, you decide to go further, continue under that type of program. Okay. Are you there? Yeah, yeah, we're still there. I was just trying to ΓÇô oh, there, I think it's ΓÇô we're having a little ΓÇô I'm kind of new to the system that we use. Okay. Send us a fax number as well, too, just in case. Okay. No, definitely email is going to work. One second, though. I do actually ΓÇô I just got to it, and I'm going to send it in a second. I'm going to put you on a brief hold, though. No, go ahead. Okay. I just want to make sure I got the email right. It's loading screens. Okay, so it's admissions at northstarregional.com. Admissions at northstarregional.com. Is that right? That's correct. Okay. All right, I'm sending it over right now. Yeah. Yeah, this should be in your inbox in just a second now. Okay. Also, it should be coming from an email that's like legityellisatlive.com. It's not like a company email I use or anything. Okay, we received it. We're going to work on this, and then we'll give you a call back. Jeff, to let you know, we'll call you back to see if we can schedule when he can come in, okay? Okay. But it would be just so we're on the same page. So once you guys receive that, once you look at that and you see that the recommendation is already for an outpatient program, that's what we'll be talking about, right? Not an inpatient program? Yeah, so from what we were saying, I know you guys recommended outpatient, but because of his last date of use, he used not too long ago. So because of that, he won't qualify for outpatient treatment. For outpatient treatment? Yeah, the insurance won't cover it. Because he just used not too long ago. But he does qualify for the residential treatment program. So you guys just want to look at the assessment and maybe get back to me? Yes. Okay. All right, that sounds good. I look forward to hearing from you guys. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.","strategic_notes":"{\"title\":\"Intake Screening for Matthew Marcellus\",\"summary\":\"Brandon Gillis from Generation Hope coordinated an intake screening for Matthew Marcellus with North Star Regional.

Hey, Brandon, how are you doing? I'm doing good. I'm just gonna check out right now. Okay. What happened? Is your daughter okay? Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's fine. I'm good. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Sorry about that. Okay, so I'm good now. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'm just getting into town and my waiting for my first appointment to like get back to me, but you can hear me okay, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, just kind of pick up where we were before, man. Oh, so you're still there? Okay. Yeah. Just pick up where we were before. If anybody hasn't told you this, man, like you're super awesome, like hard worker, like it sucks that we don't get to post that example like on Connect Team because you definitely should be recognized for that amount of that level of dedication is what I'm saying. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I do take pride in being a dedicated and loyal, you know what I mean, worker to the people that I interact with, you know, for sure. So, thank you for saying that. Yeah. Now, to put you back in that supervisorial role, I noticed that if I were to say overall my performance is great, things like good things are happening all around, but on paper, I have a noticeable late reporting issue that I've been fucking struggling to kick. Okay. And I would just like to communicate that I'm noticing that in my behavior and yeah, fuck. Okay. I mean, how many, you know, you have a bunch of late notes right now or? Well, I mean, like, no, there's like all my notes are submitted. Like, they're not like open. None of them are open still, like, or not complete. It's just my goal has been to, you know, report the day of and I just been like, so well, the last couple of days, I've I've, I usually like work my normal hours, but then I'll leave the area, go home. And then I'll come back in the evening to go to like a meeting. And I'll bring like some clients to the meeting and that by doing that, it's been, you know, it's been getting me more connected with the like recovery out here in St. Cloud. And, you know, it's also duly helping me get more hours. Yeah. So, but generally, and I guess the issue is like, when I, when I get home after that, you know, my, my kids like super miss me and I miss them. And I wanted to like, give them a little bit of attention, but still get my reports filed. And, and then it turns into like, I'm doing it like last thing, like right before midnight. And, and then, and it's yeah. So, I mean, they all end up getting completed, but it's like, like maybe completed at like 1am or some shit like that. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I, I understand life happens. I mean, I think that sometimes we're trying to juggle different balls, right? Like one of them is, you know, the ever present, you know, like need for the 20 hours and, or hopefully more than that, but, you know, you know, showing up which in a practical sense is showing up your clients when and how they need it, you know? Figuring out how to get the notes done is, you know, part of the battle, but that's a little bit more controllable, you know? And I think that, you know, the, the bigger concern would again, just to be continued to, you know, get the appointments done, um, you know, period, um, and continue to like, you know, um, follow up with the ones that you've been both assigned and, or the, you know, new referrals as they come, um, how, how has that been going for you? Oh, definitely. It's like, um, I'm onboarding. I've been onboarding like crazy and that's going super well. Like I've been, uh, yeah, like I've onboarded somebody who just became billable yesterday and then I successfully completed the onboarded and submitted CD assessment for somebody, another individual yesterday. Um, so they're like, I'm assuming going to be going through Danes today. Um, and then I have this one person that I've onboarded and I'm, I'm, I'm not letting them go. Like I've been so on about like, dude, we're doing a CD assessment. Like I call him, I, I buy him, I stop out and I get him breakfast, uh, all the time to kind of make sure that he's, uh, knows that he's cared about and, but I can't like extend myself further than that without that CD assessment and all that. That's, uh, and then, uh, so with that, those are the new things that I know, new clients I've been working on. And then I also have, uh, um, I think two people that are already like, uh, on my schedule that I've been working with and that's been going well. Yeah, really well. Okay. Um, good. That's good to hear. Um, have you heard or been able to make any progress on those? Yeah, they'd be, um, of the, those clients that you thought were billable that weren't. I did. I did talk with, uh, Chrissy Riley recently about that. And I, and, um, and basically I was, uh, we, through a conversation I had with her, it, uh, I guess I'm not the first, the, I'm not the first person to tell her that, uh, her, uh, she's like basically just outside of, uh, the requirements allowing us to work with her in that realm. Uh, so I kind of like, just, I think I, this is like half text conversation, half in person. I told her that, like, um, like I'd like to remain friends as in a, in a recovery community of sense. Uh, you know, and I congratulated her on her uh, near two years of sobriety now. And, uh, basically just told her, you know, I wish I would have been able to work with you a little bit more hands-on when, uh, I, I had, had her billable. So if there's anything that I could do to help her in the future, please let me know. Um, and that's, um, where that is. Okay. Um, so should I make her, her inactive then? Yes. Yes. Uh, you can make her inactive. And I was actually about to say, I've been, I've actually requested this one individual to be marked as inactive, uh, named Craig Peterzak, but, uh, through some chance of randomness, I actually just ran into him at, uh, Salvation Army when I was picking up a client yesterday morning. Uh, and I told him, I was like, Hey, how you been? And, uh, you remember me? Like, let's get like, let's connect and, uh, we'll go from there. So I guess I'm going to try to reach out to him again. And, uh, now that I know where he's at and he kind of remembers me, maybe that will be a place to pick up on onboarding them because he just needs his CD assessment done. Okay. Okay. So, um, but yeah, that's a really good, really good. Um, I'd have to say as far as like, if I were to be having a conversation with Azak and cause I know he's got very firm, got very firm, uh, expectations of what my activity should be like out here. I feel like if I were to have a conversation with him, I'd be able to tell him that I made a very positive impact out here and, uh, my, I should be like near, yeah, I'm consistently improving and reinforcing, uh, improvements with interactions and the hours that I'm accumulating. Yeah. Um, are you, are you still checking in with and, or seeing Heidi? Oh, absolutely. Okay. Yeah. She, well, she's there. There's no doubt that she is, she may not be my supervisor, but she's my team lead. So yeah, yeah, for sure. She's way smarter than me on some things. And I, uh, yeah, the experience. Yeah. Yep. Definitely. Okay, cool. Yeah. I'm, I'm glad because you know, she's definitely the, you know, the, uh, the go-to person, you know, in that area. So that was, that would be who I would be seeing, working with, referring to, et cetera. You know, she's calling right now. You want me to add her to the call? No, nope, nope. I'll just let you go. Yeah. Answer her call and I'll just talk to you later. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Hello. Good morning. Hello. How are you? I was just on the phone with miles and I'm kind of just waiting for my first appointment to get it back to me. Um, but, uh, what, how are you doing? Good. So, um, is your first appointment a billable client? Absolutely. 100%. Good. Cause we need to have you start focusing on billable people. I have a client that I have, um, fully onboarded. I pulled him out of one of the sober houses last week when I went there. Um, and I onboarded two of them and I'm going to give you one of them. His name is Troy and his last name's like, I can't pronounce that shit, but I already talked to him this morning. He's an older gentleman. Um, he's going to need to start working or find a job. I'm trying to get, I'm going to be emailing this, um, guy about the MET program, which is kind of like what Red does. He volunteers and he gets paid for it. Um, but I told him, you have to be old enough. Um, I told him, um, that I was going to let you know, but I'm going to put him on your, um, I'm going to put him on your caseload right now as you as primary, and I will send you his number. Um, I'm sorry, I'm talking, I'm clicking as we speak. Totally cool. Um, so that will be another, he'll basically be like a full-time client for you because he's going to need, he's going to have a lot of needs. And out of the two people, I feel like you can, you will be able to help him most, um, between you and Rachel, you know what I mean? And so I'm going to send you his number right now. I'll send it from, uh, I did that to send it from my work phone. So, no, don't do that. No, don't do that. Shut up. I just had a whole argument with myself. So I'm sending you his number right now from my work phone. There you go. Um, but I would just reach out to him today and see when you guys can meet up to do like the initial meet and greet and then also wellness plan. Okay. So you've not, is he just on boarded or like, have you met with him a couple of times? Nope. I just got him billable on Tuesday. Oh, so I still have one more time to do the one or two more times to do the recovery wellness plan before I, well, technically, yeah, but it's a good habit to start doing it like the first meeting or two. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So, um, thank you. Thank you for that. Um, what do you got going on today? Like, are you super busy besides our mandatory meeting? Uh, we don't have mandatory. We get, we're going to the sober house tonight. Okay. Um, yeah, I have a bunch of miscellaneous **** to do. Yeah. I was going to run something past you. Um, it's kind of like, um, I don't know. Yeah, something I started doing with I had to do with somebody else like as far as like kind of keeping my notes together and like, uh, I know that, uh, you're a little bit more old school versus I'm like a little bit more techie. Uh, I, uh, started doing this thing recently. That's like **** actually really cool. And I was just going to show it to you and, yeah. And I see if that any of any aspect of that seemed to be helpful. Um, and I'm going to, I'm going to see if that any of any aspect of that seemed interesting to you. Okay. Well, um, you can show me, I'll be in and out of the office all day. All right. I'm just going to pull up to the office right now because I'm not going to drive around town waiting for my appointment to call me back. He's must've slept in or something. Right. Well, if anything, reach out to Troy. Absolutely. I'll do that. No sense on lacing your time. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. All right. I'll see you shortly. All right.","strategic_notes":"{\"title\":\"Case Management Update and Client Handover\",\"summary\":\"Brandon discussed his reporting challenges and onboarding successes with Miles before receiving a new client referral, Troy, from team lead Heidi Austin.

It takes about like 15 minutes and that just gets, um, some background information for his chart. And then, um, depending on the location, we have three locations and Chaska Eden Prairie and, um, if he had a strong preference for one, we put him on that waitlist or put him at that location. If there was an opening, otherwise, um, if he had no preference or was able to go to any of the three of them that does, um, make it a quicker placement quickly. But, um, if there is an opening, then we're able to pretty much just go move on to that step unless there's like a tentative discharge date that we're aiming for. Um, and then if he needs to go on the waitlist, then we would just stay in touch with either you or both of you, um, in regards to any movement on that list. Okay. Um, so let's see. I think that, um, maybe I could put you, would you be okay if I put you on a brief hold and I got him on the phone? So if we could, uh, cause I'm pretty sure I'm going to advise to him that we at least, uh, do the phone screening while we're all on the phone and you get put on a waitlist so that we know that we have that option available, but we're, I'm gonna be with him like in the next half hour anyways. So I can, if I could just put you on a brief hold, I can put him on the phone. Yeah. All right. One second. Sorry. Thank you for your patience. I am. I don't know if it's super obvious or not, but I'm still driving on my way. Okay. All right. Cool. One, all right. Just one second now. Okay. Are you still there? I'm still here.

Yeah. Yeah, it sucks when people cheat on you. What's her name? Cassie. Aren't you like in love with her or something? What? Nothing. I mean, that's a very, very platonic love. Okay.

You miss me the most, right? Yeah, you know, in case you're wondering, in case you're wondering, when I think about you guys, you guys are stuck in child form.

A turkey. Yeah, whatever it is, I managed to put it all in my hand. All right. I think we have enough. I don't really know what else to get.

Yeah, it's going to be summertime, though. Oh, you don't get it. You're a boy. But with that being said, I am the smallest I've been in a long time. That's because you're such a hard worker and you do everything for this family. I know. Well, I've never lost any pounds. Except for calling me when I want you to all the time. Whatever. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Actually, me and some of my comrades that I used to hang out with, they all were kind of thinking that maybe dad did include mom in things kind of a lot. I include you in shit, too. Oh, yeah, like ordering groceries? No. Don't be dramatic, Brandon. It'd be... Maybe I... You're dramatic. Fucking talking about your fucking hips or whatever the hell you were just saying a second ago. I wasn't talking about no hips. Man, I got bunions. I do have those, but... Oh, my gosh. I can't help it. I don't even know why I have them. I'll pray for you. Bunions. You know what? Actually, I'm going to save my prayers for the guy that was sitting next to me in the meeting because that guy, his bunions are so bad that he's not going to be able to make it to the meeting tomorrow night because he's got going through surgery. Specifically for bunions. And yes, he was black if in case that matters at all. Don't be wondering. No, I'm sorry. I will repeat it whenever we get out of the house. Okay.

I, I, I do have a few things I got to take care of. I was going to say, do you have your girlfriend? You got a girlfriend that stays with you too? Somewhat. Kind of. We're complicated. Is she there now? No. No, but that's what I'm getting everything situated. So, I shampooed my carpet. My house is literally a mess right now. That's what I've been taking care of all day. Laundry, fucking my house. And then, yeah. I, yeah. If it was planned out, honestly, if I had known a few days ago, I could have probably damn went. But I have this weird, I have this weird thing. I don't know. I just, I'm not ready. You don't have to apologize. It's okay. I apologize because I was like, I kind of like, hey, you should come, man. You're all right. But I was like, kind of rope again. Yeah, it is. It is kind of my sneaky way. I mean, I used to be a drug user. Obviously, I still like act like I am on drugs sometimes. Like, like all trying to con you into coming. I'm sorry. It's not, it's not like a ethical or like a professional way for me to behave. And I apologize for that. Hey, no, dude, you're 100% all right. You're drugs. Part of that unlocks a part of us that, you know, we didn't know before drugs. And that sticks with us in a certain way. And like, everybody has that little damn, like, dude, I'm even when I'm damn completely sober, I damn have my fucking people think I'm damn, you know, it's all right. Who cares what people think? Honestly, you know, but here's what I'm, I'm actually, I don't know if you've worked, you've worked with other CPR SS in the past, but I'll tell you, I'm not like the others. I don't know whether you're high, you know, honestly, I know for a fact that I know for a fact, some of the other people I work with are fucking smoked all the time, but it's not like, it's not my concern. I don't even think about it. Yeah. Whether you're high or not, like we're all about like, just being better spiritually. Right. And lifting each other up. And right now I'm, I'm bringing you your bag. Well, actually I'm picking up some other dude from work right now. Uh, who's like actually really close to where you are. Uh, so, and if I'm, so as I'm your sober friend, I am required to tell you the truth at some time. So am I, was that a good assumption? Right. So, I mean, I, I, I don't, everybody tells the truth. You know, I, I do my best to let down that, that barrier I put there to possibly tell a damn lie, but not to hurt anybody. Um, I just do it. So, well, I know I'm not casting any judgment or anything ever, but never will I ever cast judgment on you. Just, uh, just laying that out there. But, uh, what was I going to say? Uh, uh, what was I going to say? Uh, fucking shit. Oh yeah. The truth. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's what I was going to say. And, or if this is your first time going to a meeting, like ever, which I, I don't think it is like anxiety. It's, it's, it's uncomfortable. It's not, it's everything's uncomfortable in the beginning. I was a big part of, uh, the sober community actually, um, through half of this year and then half of it, I just, you know, went back to bullshitting and them distancing myself because I don't like lying to people. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody's asking you to lie. That's what I will have to do though. If I do show up and I'm sober, I can't, I just feel disrespectful. Like if I'm damn standing there high. You're disrespectful to yourself. If anything, because, because you know, like it's your anxiety wins is winning the, at the end of the day. It's not like you're coming. You're new. You can't come because you're like, you got COVID-19. But yeah, you're right. Um, I promise. All right. All right. I guess. I mean, obviously I'm not going to let it force you into anything. I'm Susan or rape. You don't have to force me next week. Um, I got it. Yeah. Because I know I get it. So listen, there's this harm reduction thing. You know, whether you're sober or not, like as long as you believe you're in recovery, you're in recovery. And that's the way that works. You know, you know, you remember, you know that, right? Now I do. You know, you never knew that. No. Yeah. That's the truth. And that's, if you ask anybody, the like, Hey, if the person smokes weed, is that, are they in recovery? Do they, but I was an example, but yeah, that's the rule. Yeah. You know, you're like one of the younger guys I've worked with and probably one of the cooler ones I've met out here. And I will be slightly offended if we don't fucking spend some more time together throughout the week, but I get it. We don't have to hang out in my fucking office when, when we do things, you know that, right. I do need help. I do need help Friday. I need it. I need a ride to an interview if that's possible. What ride? Yeah. A ride to an interview on Friday. Yeah. I'm going to need a ride to fucking. Yeah. I do rides, but it's like, I mean, I could get somebody to do that. I'm going to, I got you. Yeah. Just don't just, I'm, I'm here to be, I'm here for you. And actually you should be like right next to me right now. That's why I'm on the phone with you still. I feel like I'm just actually talking to you out of my own anxiety. My bad. You're all right. I'll be, I'll be, I'll be meeting up with this guy here in a second. And yeah, just let me know when you're here. I'm going to get dressed real quick and I'll be on my way. Okay. All right.

I can. I can hear you. Yeah, what's going on? How are you? I'm doing okay. I'm doing more than okay. But how are you doing? I'm doing well. I'm typing. Yeah. Did I catch you at the end of the day? Or like, you good? Yeah, I'm good. I'm just waiting for my sister to come pick me up. And yeah, I'm just finishing up my work day. I really, really, really, really. Well, actually, I've been meaning to really kind of just wanted to reach out in general before the tonight, just to kind of see, make sure you're okay, because I don't know. I had no idea what was going on around you. And, you know, with this chaos and crazy stuff going down there. I was. Yeah, I just had no clue to know if you're like safe or not, or whatever. But yeah, I'm glad to hear you're okay. I'm doing well. I mean, I'll say one thing, at least about the chaos around us. It's just chaos. So I also like have my faith of humanity. And honestly, Minnesota raised me. So I'm just happy that everything's good. And all of our folks are safe. I think that's my main priority is that our folks are safe. Yeah. Yeah, that was honestly, like a huge concern. I mean, I tried not to worry, because that's not like, I learned not to worry, because it's not putting my faith in God. But I'm glad that you're safe. But I actually really wanted to, I don't know, I was actually just kind of puzzling myself over something that was kind of outside of my work duties. And I'm just asking myself this question. I was like, who is like somebody I could like talk to about this topic? That is just like way smarter than me, and could kind of, I don't know, make more sense out of how to approach. And you're that person. I'm honored. Yes. Okay, so I guess I could start with a pain point, I suppose, as how this whole interest started. But, you know, with Zach, you know, how the puppy, the dog, the whatever, and he got a dog, and he wasn't able to really care for it. And, and, and I guess that is a very common pain point in shelters and people with the homeless and low income individuals, they, they, you know, get into relationships with their canines, and not only they don't, they like lack the proper training and shots and knowledge, and, and to be able to be that, like, good owner. And I don't know, I just thought of it, there being like some sort of amazing community program that would be available for people to like, anybody that was interested to like come in and, I don't know, do some like dog training, like group dog training. I don't know what, I don't know what, what an event like that would look like. But that's kind of where my thoughts had started. And I had spoken to one of my clients about this interest, just thinking out loud, and he said, oh, you want to talk to this person. And he put me in touch with somebody that also works in the homeless shelter communities. Her name is Carmen. Oh, yeah, I thought it was a word called serenity. Yeah, no, well, so Carmen, I guess she works, center care, but I think she also does a lot of time, her job takes her into the homeless shelters. So she sees this, and she full full time, like trains, pet comfort pets, you know, like the pets that you bring into doctor's offices for therapeutic reasons. And so she, yeah, yeah. So she's, yeah, so she's an expert that like, you know, getting those animals like certified, and she knows the process, and she does that well. And I'm like, so glad that I record all my phone conversations, because there's no way I can take everything out of that conversation without having it transcribed. But yeah, I don't know, I see a need, and I don't have the knowledge in this field, this nonprofit, the fundraising. I'm kind of resourceful, but I guess I wanted to know, what would your, if you had come if you had come along this interest, and you wanted to make sure that it had like the best opportunity to provide all these tools and benefits to low income individuals, what, what would you do to kind of reinforce it or kind of build, make, I don't know, you got me? Yeah, like, what is the consultation of like, how an organization like this would be set up? That's, um, my first thought goes to one, do you want this to be for profit or nonprofit? Um, well, I guess I thought that I didn't kind of think about that. Like, there are organizations out there that kind of do similar stuff to this. A lot of them. Yeah. But I, um, I don't know, I guess there wouldn't be any profit in it. I think because there'd probably be a lot of actually funds that would have to be given or donated from higher up organizations or so. So the reason why I asked that is say for profit, um, example, I'll use a t-shirt as an example, say that you now have a branded t-shirt and Brandon Giles, you built the brand that for every t-shirt sold, it goes to supporting individuals that are homeless, uh, that would like to upkeep their animal care. Then that's my first thought process. So that, and then you could continue your work on another level. And that's why I say nonprofit to now donate your funds that you've made in your LLC through your organization to start the implementation process. Okay. So then you would have to build out a program where, in which like, if you're asking for money, anyone that has money is going to ask you, how can you prove the work that's being done? So then you got to think about data in that sense of like, either one, um, is there an intake process for every animal that's getting care? Are you also connected with a animal center? Right. Um, so then you could either be connected with, since you're a little farther out, it's a lot easier to connect with different veteran, uh, like veterinarians or like animal hospitals in that sense, because since you're a little bit in that rural Minnesota side, there's a lot more farmland on that side. So then building a like personal relationship with those folks. So then you're able to kind of get that work done in tangent with the veterinarians, because again, some of those things like the shots and everything has to get done at a vet's office. Um, so then that's the part I'm thinking about. The other thing that comes, you're recording, right? Cause I I'm not going to remember everything. Okay, good. Um, the other thought process that I'm thinking is like, in the sense of say a animal is now, um, sick, sick to the means of they might need to receive treatment for an illness or cancer in that sense. Uh, what is the process in which, or like even referral for the animal and the individual? And then at what point is also an animal considered safe or dangerous? If, um, so that's a little bit of like building a relationship with law enforcement, right. Or local law enforcement to those individuals so that if, and when something does happen or occur, then you can be, be a referral point from the law enforcement. Like maybe, um, example, if an officer knows your resources there, they can tell the person like, Hey, I know that there was a dog bite. Um, we're unsure if the dog has rabies in that sense, or even animal control, having those connections to animal control is another like business model piece I could think about. Um, and then there's the, the genuine piece of it. If you're going to do nonprofit work, um, I always tell people expect the unexpected, always expect to get broke because end of the day, the work that's being done in nonprofit world is honest work. I think I went on a tangent, but that's where my mind was going. You're amazing. I, uh, I know that I have to be respectful of your time. And, um, Okay. I'm waiting for my ride. Remember you are, you are still like in the cities. You're like not far away or anything. Yeah. Uh, my office is moved. So the office you had seen me at, I had moved over to the office next to Dearmon because my position had changed. I don't know if you have seen, uh, the posts that was made. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I did. Um, yeah, I wanted to start off by congratulating you. I think that honestly everybody that works in this company is super, super thankful for you guys and all the work that you guys do. Like they couldn't have found two better people to do the roles that they are, that you guys are doing. And that's, that's a really good thing. Yeah, it is. How are you doing though? Are you like staying safe and out the way? I hope you're not in the mix of any, any chaos. Um, that's true. The only chaos, the only chaos that my life really entails is, uh, just driving in Minnesota roads. Like, I don't know. Yeah, that's a dangerous thing, but I'm thankful that that's the only danger I really have going on in my life. Um, uh, but also, but aside from that, um, yeah, things have actually been going really, really well. Um, I, uh, take my, uh, my, my job very seriously and, um, yeah, uh, yeah, actually, I don't know. I'm just really, really good at what I do and I feel like I'm only getting better and I don't know. I guess I'm just thankful in a sense that, I don't know. I've, I think that God has always blessed me when, with, when I'm in a position like this, he always puts like the best people above me to learn from. And, uh, yeah, like Miles, Miles is like an awesome, he's like, I try to like keep it, obviously we keep it professional, but I would, I would, yeah, he's such a cool guy. I would, I would back that guy up in a fight, I think, realistically. Mood. I love that. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. But, uh, yeah, I was a little bit of a, uh, it shook my tree a little bit when AZAC was like, yes, you must transfer all your Minneapolis clients and, you know, be loyal to St. Cloud and Mora. And I, um, you know, it's not my, my needs or my thoughts, it's really the company's thoughts and what's the thoughts of the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. And still, I feel like there's been a significant improvement, uh, and just everybody, I don't know. I'm working with, um, they're the new primaries for the people that my clients were transferred to. Yeah. And, um, yeah, yeah. I, I know if I were to have a conversation with AZAC, I'd be able to report to them that things have been going well, despite, um, I, I did see that I had a formal write-up last week. Um, yeah, that was a little unexpected, but I, I don't know, we've talked, I talked with Miles about it. And I think that, uh, technically at some point since I uh, ended my leave, I had, I didn't immediately start off doing 20 hours. So I think for that reason, I got wrote up for not doing 20 hours, but my last week was over 20 hours. So, I mean, I know I'm doing good and, and moving forward, especially. Um, yeah. Yeah. I'm happy you're in St. Cloud. Like, Brandon, a lot of folks can learn from you more than you even realize. Yeah. You're a good peer. You're a good person. Yeah. I, uh, thank you. Thank you for that. I do, um, have my little things about me that make me unique, like my, my little techie side. I don't know. It's kind of interesting. Um, but, um, yeah, as I'm kind of progressing through at this and getting better, um, I'm also developing other skills that I have. But yeah, I mean, everything is about growth. It is. Yeah. I mean, ultimately, like I, my, I don't know if I actually mentioned this to like AZAC when I got hired, but ultimately my long-term goal with getting into this field is to learn as much as I can about this industry and, and like Excel and, you know, kind of whatever organic way. I don't really, I don't really foresee myself becoming a competitor because I, that doesn't make sense really, but yeah. I mean, like for your, your, your position, for example, you, you are a CP on this, but yeah, you have those skills that about like grant writing. I never was a CPRS. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you did have a certification at some point. No, I have a justice lived experience. Is that it? Yeah. I just remember you saying something about my clients in my case load. Yeah. But certain things. So I worked for almost a little shy of over, I want to say three years, two and a half. I don't remember. So look at my resume. I don't remember, but I worked in an organization with different LAGCs and LMFTs and LPCCs. So all, all the therapists come across a lot of therapists in the state of Minnesota that I've worked very, very closely with. I've learned a lot more in my 26 years than I have realized that makes sense. So I've been in most of the social services and for a while. And I think I told you before I've done research for a while as well. Yeah. Yeah. So the old job I used to work at, I did grant management and grant writing. And then a lot of consultation services that I provide is in around grant management and data. So like data equity, data analytics, all those cases. And those are services, like those are skills that you have developed. Do you actually, do you do, I don't know how you would consider that. Would you do freelance for another organization if the opportunity became available? Um, another organization can pay the LLC that I own. Right. That's right. Of course. Yeah. They can contract, they can contract me out via the org, but like me as an independent individual, like no. Right. No, I understand. You're, you're an LLC with those as I, yeah, totally. I love that business end of it. Yeah. Cause I've seen it before where individuals kind of take intellectual property. So that's why I was like, I'm a little protective on that piece. Yeah. You know, can I, um, I'm always a little reluctant about sharing some of my, my endeavors, my, uh, thoughts about the future with some of my employers, because it's actually, it actually hasn't gotten me, uh, well, I don't know what, what the, whatever. Anyways, that was a unique situation, but I, uh, I really want to feel like it's on, on my, on me to want to, uh, uh, this, this, this role just became known to me. That's called citizen developer. And, um, I don't know if you've ever heard of that before, but essentially they just like modernize, you know, companies and like improve, um, by like implementing workflows and digitizing things, like basically automating things. And yeah. And, um, I found out that, I mean, I have one thing that's helped me back from getting in the it industry is like, I thought that similar to like, uh, the contract here that like, if you don't have a degree in, in it, and then you have no legal, uh, you shouldn't, you don't have no right to practice, but I guess it's not like that in the it industry. You can actually practice without a license. Yeah. But I mean, the only competitive piece to it would be like, if you want to make yourself palatable to the next individual, certain certifications or degrees can like help you. Absolutely. And that's, and that's what I would be going towards as well. If I'm my next steps to make that like, uh, uh, income source or whatever, but yeah, I kind of want to be able to, because I don't know, my, my sister who's actually also kind of does the same thing. She does it like the same thing. Like she lives in Florida. Yeah. Like, I don't know, for example, sorry, go ahead. I was going to say, you don't need a degree for a lot of the work that's being done online right now, as long as you can maneuver and you have those skills, that's all that matters. Cause our systems are changing every day. Right. I think if you at least have the basics of like software engineering process, so like how to maneuver in the system when you're, you're kind of golden. Right. Yeah. I mean, I, I, my, my knowledge is definitely like really intense. Like I, I don't know, I, I, I interact with businesses and people and their hobbies and their, whatever they have going on super frequently. And then I, I, I see like ways that their, their system could be like improved so that it's like pain points or, and, and I, I don't know, but then I'm like still thinking to myself presently, like, like, for example, I had those, these thoughts when I went to the homeless shelters in St. Cloud, I was like, cause I seen that the staff there were very overwhelmed and like the culture was kind of rather grim. And, and I just thought of ways of maybe like, I dunno, just improving things for them that would make, I dunno, things more, I dunno, easier. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that place of hope still does all their intake, like, like by hand, like, I dunno, I don't, don't quote me on this, but they may be still be filing stuff in cabinets, which is great, but not practical. In the short term. Yeah. In the short term, but not logical in the long term. Right. But file cabinet is better in case they get subpoenaed. Absolutely. Yeah. For seven years. Man, I, I don't know. I wish I could talk to you more often. Maybe I'm in your position. I'll be able to talk, just share my thoughts a little bit more. Cause I actually, I'm gonna take my notes from my last conversation, that conversation earlier in this conversation, and maybe we can maybe just kind of email them to you. And I don't know what you want to call that. I don't know. I call that just a paper trail of the convos, but I would say keep the intellectual property for yourself. You have my consent on that and then see how you could figure out your model on that. Always create. Absolutely. Yeah. Oh, okay. I'm actually gonna, I'm getting back into St. Cloud for my last part of my day. I have just recently integrated rounding people up and going to meetings in the area. Okay. No worries. We can talk another time. You have a wonderful day. Okay. Yes. You too. It was great talking with you. I'll talk to you soon. You as well.

Hey, Brandon, it's Carmen. How are you? Hey, Carmen. I'm doing well. Good. Is now a good time or you want me to call later? No, this is perfect. Okay. How can I help? So, I guess I kind of was just talking with Red and, I don't know, one or two other people that are in the St. Cloud area, Stearns County area, and I was kind of interested in kind of finding, putting together something that, and this is like totally just me thinking out loud. I mean, I don't actually know your background at all, but I kind of wanted to put together a program that would assist low-income individuals with perhaps some dog training, some kind of course to get them, what's the term I'm looking for, personal, a service animal, you know, emotional support animal, like basically, I don't know, some sort of a community program that's just kind of a one-time deal. Anybody that's available or interested would be able to kind of, I don't know, get these services that I'm sure would cost money, but maybe you could tell me a little bit more about yourself. Well, I have therapy dogs, so they're registered therapy dogs through an organization called Pet Partners, and you have to go through online training, and then you have, your dog needs to be a good citizen, meaning they have to sit, stay, you know, they can't be aggressive, they have to listen, and then you go through an evaluation with a trainer to get your dog registered, and then that dog is registered to provide therapy to other people. That's what I do. I have a therapy horse, and I have two therapy horses and therapy dogs. So we provide therapy, so I go to the hospital, for example, and people, you know, that are in the hospital can find comfort, you know, and I brought my horses to the shelters with Red and, you know, people that, you know, horses are very sensitive animals, and they can really bring a lot of joy and a lot of peace to people. So that's that whole piece of it. That's called therapy animals. Emotional support, that is a dog that's for you, right, for your emotional support. The problem that happens a lot is people get these, I'm working in the homeless shelter, so that's kind of my perspective. People get these animals, and then they aren't trained, they don't have the money to vaccinate them, or they don't get them neutered or spayed, and then the dog misbehaves, and then they're struggling, because they're homeless. So yes, this is the pain point that I'm actually trying to focus on right now, because I want us to do something, and it sounds like you have direct knowledge of the pain point exactly. Yeah, I just spent this morning, I picked up a kennel for somebody that is at one of the shelters, and their dog is struggling. It's a puppy, and, you know, and I spent a half an hour doing some dog training, how to get the dog to sit without yelling, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit a hundred times, you know. I'm a dog trainer, I mean, I've self-taught and trained my dog, I've trained, I have a Border Collie, and I have a LabMix, and you know, I've trained some general knowledge, but I also have taken a lot of classes. So what we should do is kind of, you know, like, is there an opportunity to offer a dog class for basic training, like at Archangels? Could we do it? I'm sure Alex would probably support that, you know, like of an evening or something like that, where could we bring in someone that would be a, you know, dog, I have somebody in mind, I don't know what her volunteer commitment looks like, but could, you know, could she come in and provide some, you know, hands-on dog training and talk to people for free, maybe? And then the veterinary care, there's low cost, spay and neuter through SNAP. And also, Petsco has low cost vaccinations, and so it's still a cost, you know, but do we get, I mean, is there a way to get some funding from, you know, like donors that would want to donate some money to help people that need that? I don't know, you know, so that's what I got for you. So, yes, I can see why Red put me in contact with you. So you, I think that you are a very pivotal and important part of this process, that it could happen. And I would like to think that Alex would definitely support something like that. But I don't know, yeah, I just see, because I come from Minneapolis area, and, you know, Minneapolis area, I've been working kind of both areas, and it seems to be a very, very common problem issues where, like you just described, you know, I've never been trained or taught how to raise an animal or puppy. And you know, but these animals become like some sort of life support when somebody has close to nothing. Yeah, and that's, you know, there's that human animal bond that, you know, you just, it's indescribable, you know. But the problem is when, you know, the animal isn't trained, and then, you know, the people don't know what to do. And so they misguide the animal, and then they become aggressive. And then they bite somebody. And then, you know, that whole, it's not fair to the animal, right? It's really not fair to take a dog or a cat and have them if you don't have the means to care for them. It's just really not. It's not. So, you know, education up front for people, I know the shelters, you know, they do a lot of education and stuff, but, or like the animal shelters and stuff, you know, but just that, you know, if you're thinking of getting a service, well, not a service animal, emotional support animal, you know, here is the don'ts. Don't do this. Don't do that. You know, do, you know, do make sure you have money for the vaccinations and the, if they're not spayed and neutered, do make sure you have money to pay for food. Dog food's not cheap. You know, it's expensive. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, it was just a huge responsibility. And then it's, it's sad because the dog doesn't get trained. And then, you know, they get bad habits and anxiety and, you know, then, yeah, it's hard. But as far as service animals, that's a whole nother category. So service animals are a dog or cat, you know, an animal trained specifically to provide a service to the owner. You think of blind people have a service dog for seeing eye dog, that's a service dog, or somebody that's a veteran, you know, they get, they have PTSD and they're able to get a dog that's their support animal. But the dog or seizures, some dogs are trained to, you know, notify when the person may have a seizure. So those are specific things. But those costs thousands of dollars, because the training for that is not just good citizens, it's the specific training for the individual. And I understand in a situation like that, a lot of cases, like an insurance, their insurance will actually, you know, maybe even their insurance pays for some of that training to have that animal there. I'm sure there's programs. I'm not, but it sounds like you were very knowledgeable. And actually, everything I don't know if I record all my phone conversations. So actually, and it's just because everything you've said so far is just gold. And actually, I can tell you're be very, very, like everything that you said, I can put into an articulatable lesson, just based off of this conversation. I'm pretty tech savvy myself. And I, and I've got a pretty good background and I don't know, just kind of community organization, entrepreneur. This is actually a new field for me, being in the health field as a CPRS. You're familiar with the CPRSs, of course. No, I work with Heidi and Rachel. And yep, yep, they're awesome. You guys are awesome what you do. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. But yes, I definitely, this is kind of an extracurricular project I'm kind of pursuing. But I think that if I could get your text me or email and like your kind of first name, last name, somebody, ways I can get ahold of you and share your information on a professional level, I can kind of put together what I can find out more about what resources are available for us to make this more of a significant, concrete impact. Well, I belong to a group called Central Minnesota Therapy Animals. And it's a lot of retired people. I'm not as active as I'd like because I still work. But they go around to the hospital, the schools, colleges, and it's all therapy dogs that they do and bring their, so I can, when we have a meeting coming up in February, if I'm able to attend, I can pitch kind of, hey, we see a need to help people that are, you know, have service or emotional support animals, and they need some help with training, you know, how to make a good choice and see if our group has any resources. And then I have a person I can reach out to that she's a dog trainer, and just see if she would do any, like a, you know, a session to help people get started. I don't know if she does volunteer work, but we could ask. And then I have another friend that's a vet tech, and we could ask her. Unfortunately, there used to be a vet tech school in St. Cloud at Minnesota School of Business. Yeah. And they used to have students, you know, that needed projects. So this would be like a perfect project for vet tech students to try to help connect people. But that program was long since closed. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. We could, you could reach out to, like, Tri-County Humane Society and say, hey, I see this need for training, you know, people that have help training their dog for basic obedience that don't have, you know, their limited resources and stuff. And then, you know, probably part of it is compiling information and resources that you can give out to people, and then, you know, they can work from there. Oh, absolutely. And I, actually, I think I also might even have some other, I don't know who the state representatives are in this area, I guess, as far as, like, political representation, but it seems kind of far-fetched, but I don't know, maybe speaking to some of our representatives might be able to help us put together some sort of funding for something like this. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm going to share my information with you, and I think I'm going to do some more research, and I'm going to get together with you, have another conversation with you sometime, maybe by the end of this week, maybe. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, just reach out. If I don't answer you right away, you know, just, I'll try to call you back or whatever, but I'll send you my email address. I'm going to send you my personal email, because I work for CentraCare, but this isn't really a CentraCare thing, but I'll send you my personal email address, and then my personal cell phone, and you can feel free to reach me on that versus my work, because I don't answer my work phone when I'm not working, or my work phone, yeah, when I'm not working, so. Okay? Does that work? Okay. Yeah, perfect. Yes. I'll send you in a text message, it's kind of like a link, and if you click it, it automatically saves my information into your phone, nothing to be alarmed of, but, and yeah, it was great meeting you.

Hey, Brandon, it's Carmen. How are you? Hey, Carmen. I'm doing well. Good. Is now a good time or you want me to call later? No, this is perfect. Okay. How can I help? So, I guess I kind of was just talking with Red and, I don't know, one or two other people that are in the St. Cloud area, Stearns County area, and I was kind of interested in kind of finding, putting together something that, and this is like totally just me thinking out loud. I mean, I don't actually know your background at all, but I kind of wanted to put together a program that would assist low-income individuals with perhaps some dog training, some kind of course to get them, what's the term I'm looking for, personal, a service animal, you know, emotional support animal, like basically, I don't know, some sort of a community program that's just kind of a one-time deal. Anybody that's available or interested would be able to kind of, I don't know, get these services that I'm sure would cost money, but maybe you could tell me a little bit more about yourself. Well, I have therapy dogs, so they're registered therapy dogs through an organization called Pet Partners, and you have to go through online training, and then you have, your dog needs to be a good citizen, meaning they have to sit, stay, you know, they can't be aggressive, they have to listen, and then you go through an evaluation with a trainer to get your dog registered, and then that dog is registered to provide therapy to other people. That's what I do. I have a therapy horse, and I have two therapy horses and therapy dogs. So we provide therapy, so I go to the hospital, for example, and people, you know, that are in the hospital can find comfort, you know, and I brought my horses to the shelters with Red and, you know, people that, you know, horses are very sensitive animals, and they can really bring a lot of joy and a lot of peace to people. So that's that whole piece of it. That's called therapy animals. Emotional support, that is a dog that's for you, right, for your emotional support. The problem that happens a lot is people get these, I'm working in the homeless shelter, so that's kind of my perspective. People get these animals, and then they aren't trained, they don't have the money to vaccinate them, or they don't get them neutered or spayed, and then the dog misbehaves, and then they're struggling, because they're homeless. So yes, this is the pain point that I'm actually trying to focus on right now, because I want us to do something, and it sounds like you have direct knowledge of the pain point exactly. Yeah, I just spent this morning, I picked up a kennel for somebody that is at one of the shelters, and their dog is struggling. It's a puppy, and, you know, and I spent a half an hour doing some dog training, how to get the dog to sit without yelling, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit a hundred times, you know. I'm a dog trainer, I mean, I've self-taught and trained my dog, I've trained, I have a Border Collie, and I have a LabMix, and you know, I've trained some general knowledge, but I also have taken a lot of classes. So what we should do is kind of, you know, like, is there an opportunity to offer a dog class for basic training, like at Archangels? Could we do it? I'm sure Alex would probably support that, you know, like of an evening or something like that, where could we bring in someone that would be a, you know, dog, I have somebody in mind, I don't know what her volunteer commitment looks like, but could, you know, could she come in and provide some, you know, hands-on dog training and talk to people for free, maybe? And then the veterinary care, there's low cost, spay and neuter through SNAP. And also, Petsco has low cost vaccinations, and so it's still a cost, you know, but do we get, I mean, is there a way to get some funding from, you know, like donors that would want to donate some money to help people that need that? I don't know, you know, so that's what I got for you. So, yes, I can see why Red put me in contact with you. So you, I think that you are a very pivotal and important part of this process, that it could happen. And I would like to think that Alex would definitely support something like that. But I don't know, yeah, I just see, because I come from Minneapolis area, and, you know, Minneapolis area, I've been working kind of both areas, and it seems to be a very, very common problem issues where, like you just described, you know, I've never been trained or taught how to raise an animal or puppy. And you know, but these animals become like some sort of life support when somebody has close to nothing. Yeah, and that's, you know, there's that human animal bond that, you know, you just, it's indescribable, you know. But the problem is when, you know, the animal isn't trained, and then, you know, the people don't know what to do. And so they misguide the animal, and then they become aggressive. And then they bite somebody. And then, you know, that whole, it's not fair to the animal, right? It's really not fair to take a dog or a cat and have them if you don't have the means to care for them. It's just really not. It's not. So, you know, education up front for people, I know the shelters, you know, they do a lot of education and stuff, but, or like the animal shelters and stuff, you know, but just that, you know, if you're thinking of getting a service, well, not a service animal, emotional support animal, you know, here is the don'ts. Don't do this. Don't do that. You know, do, you know, do make sure you have money for the vaccinations and the, if they're not spayed and neutered, do make sure you have money to pay for food. Dog food's not cheap. You know, it's expensive. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, it was just a huge responsibility. And then it's, it's sad because the dog doesn't get trained. And then, you know, they get bad habits and anxiety and, you know, then, yeah, it's hard. But as far as service animals, that's a whole nother category. So service animals are a dog or cat, you know, an animal trained specifically to provide a service to the owner. You think of blind people have a service dog for seeing eye dog, that's a service dog, or somebody that's a veteran, you know, they get, they have PTSD and they're able to get a dog that's their support animal. But the dog or seizures, some dogs are trained to, you know, notify when the person may have a seizure. So those are specific things. But those costs thousands of dollars, because the training for that is not just good citizens, it's the specific training for the individual. And I understand in a situation like that, a lot of cases, like an insurance, their insurance will actually, you know, maybe even their insurance pays for some of that training to have that animal there. I'm sure there's programs. I'm not, but it sounds like you were very knowledgeable. And actually, everything I don't know if I record all my phone conversations. So actually, and it's just because everything you've said so far is just gold. And actually, I can tell you're be very, very, like everything that you said, I can put into an articulatable lesson, just based off of this conversation. I'm pretty tech savvy myself. And I, and I've got a pretty good background and I don't know, just kind of community organization, entrepreneur. This is actually a new field for me, being in the health field as a CPRS. You're familiar with the CPRSs, of course. No, I work with Heidi and Rachel. And yep, yep, they're awesome. You guys are awesome what you do. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. But yes, I definitely, this is kind of an extracurricular project I'm kind of pursuing. But I think that if I could get your text me or email and like your kind of first name, last name, somebody, ways I can get ahold of you and share your information on a professional level, I can kind of put together what I can find out more about what resources are available for us to make this more of a significant, concrete impact. Well, I belong to a group called Central Minnesota Therapy Animals. And it's a lot of retired people. I'm not as active as I'd like because I still work. But they go around to the hospital, the schools, colleges, and it's all therapy dogs that they do and bring their, so I can, when we have a meeting coming up in February, if I'm able to attend, I can pitch kind of, hey, we see a need to help people that are, you know, have service or emotional support animals, and they need some help with training, you know, how to make a good choice and see if our group has any resources. And then I have a person I can reach out to that she's a dog trainer, and just see if she would do any, like a, you know, a session to help people get started. I don't know if she does volunteer work, but we could ask. And then I have another friend that's a vet tech, and we could ask her. Unfortunately, there used to be a vet tech school in St. Cloud at Minnesota School of Business. Yeah. And they used to have students, you know, that needed projects. So this would be like a perfect project for vet tech students to try to help connect people. But that program was long since closed. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. We could, you could reach out to, like, Tri-County Humane Society and say, hey, I see this need for training, you know, people that have help training their dog for basic obedience that don't have, you know, their limited resources and stuff. And then, you know, probably part of it is compiling information and resources that you can give out to people, and then, you know, they can work from there. Oh, absolutely. And I, actually, I think I also might even have some other, I don't know who the state representatives are in this area, I guess, as far as, like, political representation, but it seems kind of far-fetched, but I don't know, maybe speaking to some of our representatives might be able to help us put together some sort of funding for something like this. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm going to share my information with you, and I think I'm going to do some more research, and I'm going to get together with you, have another conversation with you sometime, maybe by the end of this week, maybe. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, just reach out. If I don't answer you right away, you know, just, I'll try to call you back or whatever, but I'll send you my email address. I'm going to send you my personal email, because I work for CentraCare, but this isn't really a CentraCare thing, but I'll send you my personal email address, and then my personal cell phone, and you can feel free to reach me on that versus my work, because I don't answer my work phone when I'm not working, or my work phone, yeah, when I'm not working, so. Okay? Does that work? Okay. Yeah, perfect. Yes. I'll send you in a text message, it's kind of like a link, and if you click it, it automatically saves my information into your phone, nothing to be alarmed of, but, and yeah, it was great meeting you. Yeah, you too. So, thanks for what you do. All right. We'll talk to you soon. Take care.

And then did you check your oil? Oh, damn. The oil, I just had got an oil change. So it can't be the oil. Well, I know. But one of the symptoms, if your head gasket is cracked, you know, the antifreeze will leak into the end of your whole head. Yeah, we know that. White smoke. And then also like the oil, if you check your oil after this happened, like it'll be. Oh, it won't look like oil. It'll look like sort of white foam. No, I didn't get it. I didn't do that. But you said you got rid of it already? Yeah, I put it in the shop. So when I find out what's wrong, I'll let you know. Yeah, you might have a cracked head gasket, which can be expensive. Like, basically, you got to replace either the engine or replace the head gasket. And both of those things are super expensive to have a shop do it. Yeah. I don't know. I'm going to let you know as soon as I find out something. Yeah, by all means. Whenever they're done doing their diagnostic. Yeah, let me know. Hey, by the way, I just got your name saved in my phone as AutoZone Van Guy. Could you, like, text me? Yeah, I texted you. Yeah, text me your name. So, like, because you're a person. You're not just Van Guy, you know? Okay. Yeah. All right. I got you. I texted you. All right. You have a good day. All right. Thanks.

I'm calling on behalf of Janelle McCarter, who's with me right now, and we're trying to get in touch with her caseworker, Mina Hedden. Let's see. I do have a case number, if that helps at all. One moment. McLeod County Social Services, this is Mina. How can I help you? Hi, Mina, this is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Good, what can I help you with? Well, I'm with Generation Hope, and I'm calling on behalf of Janelle McCarter, who's actually with me right now. Janelle, can you say hi? Oh, maybe you can hear her now. Hi there. So the reason why we were calling was to, because we were just notified that we're trying to get some benefits and some assistance, and we realized that she must have applied for benefits in a different county a while ago. So we need to update her address so that you guys can transfer it to the new county. Okay, can I get, what was the client's name again? Janelle McCarter. How do you spell the last name? M-C-C-A-R-T-E-R. Let me see if I can find her here. I do have a case number. Yes, that would be extra helpful. 490-439. Okay, so I show that her case is active in County 62, which is, let me see here. McLeod? Nope, McLeod, we're 43. Let me look at my sheet. Okay. Ramsey County. She's showing active in Ramsey County. Interesting, yeah. And her address says General Delivery, St. Paul. So I can give you Ramsey County phone number, but that's who you'll have to call. Oh, goodness. Wow, they actually, the last person I just talked to gave me your information as her being her caseworker. So she doesn't show anything within your case? No, she's never been in McLeod County that I can see. Has she ever lived in McLeod County? Yeah, yeah, she said that that's where she was at just prior to being here. Yeah, the case that I see, it's all Ramsey, Ramsey, Ramsey. Nothing's moved on it since October, but. October of 25? Yes, and I mean, I show she's active on food support in Ramsey County. Oh, damn, she's not even, so, yeah, there's, I guess, a major discrepancy because she's, right now, she's receiving GRH. And according to Stearns County, the GRH and GA was set up through McLeod County. Is there a different case number, maybe? That was the only case number they gave us. But I know that, like, if she's getting food support in one county and GRH in another, I don't want her to get in trouble. No, and that's weird. Let me see here. Oh, there, she's got two. I was looking at a different Janelle McCarter. There's more than one in the system there. Still spelled the same way? Like J-A-N-E-L? Okay. Oh, she was, I found it here now. So, she was at Integrations? Yeah. Yes. Wellness? Okay, and where are you now? She's at Place of Hope in St. Cloud. I can give you an address if that's helpful at all. Okay, yeah, and I don't show that she's active on GRH. I just show that she was getting cash assistance. Okay. And are you getting cash assistance? Yeah. Okay. I just don't have a card. Yeah, she doesn't have a card or anything like that. She'll have to call EBT to get a replacement card. Okay. But let's update the address first. Yes. Oh, yeah. So. Okay. So, what date did she move there? December 24th. Yep, December 24th. Okay, and what's the address? 511. It says 511 9th Avenue North, and that's in St. Cloud. And what's the zip code there? 5-6-3-0-3. All right. And is that Stearns County? Yeah. Yes, ma'am. Okay. And Place of Hope, is that like a? A homeless shelter. A sober house, or? Okay, got it. Okay. And then is there a good phone number? I've got two numbers on file here, Janelle. Are either of these good anymore? 320-243-1599, or 612-454-2345? No. No, she said no to both of those. Okay, we'll get rid of both of those. Oh, and then. Okay. All right, so we've got that updated. Okay. Yeah, do you want an updated phone number? Sure. 320-287-8169. Okay. All right, so what I'm going to do then is I'll transfer the case to Stearns, since that's where she is now. Do you guys want the phone number for EBT to request a replacement card? Oh, I got it. Yeah, we got it already. You do, okay. But if you could get us the phone number for the finance department, so they could help us get a document, it's like a reduced fee form, to help her get her birth certificate and state ID at a reduced cost. Well, I'm a financial worker and I don't know what that form is, but let me go ask one of the other girls and see if they know about that. Hold on just a sec here. Okay. Yeah, so if I'm in slow gear. Okay, I was just talking to one of our workers who's been here a lot longer than me. And she said that sometimes social workers can help you get reduced fees, like birth certificates and stuff, but there's not a form that I have. That's fine. You guys have a social worker at your place? Yeah, Stearns County. They knew which department and who to talk to. Okay. But that's fine. I was just- Go ahead. And then since she is in Stearns now, and I'm going to move the case up there, she should probably apply for whatever benefits she needs up there. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And then, so by doing this transfer that you're doing right now, is this going to clear up the stuff that's going on in Ramsey County? Oh, I think I was just looking at the wrong case. Oh, okay. That Janelle was talking about. Oh, okay. I was just looking at the wrong case. Oh, okay. That Janelle was spelled with two L's. All right, I got you. Yeah, I was looking at the wrong... I found the right Janelle here that was at integrations. And... Yeah, that's odd. And it looks like- Oh, you didn't know them? Yeah. Oh, it wasn't- I already know that. We're all taking care of them for now, right? And is this transfer like, happen immediately? Like, are we able to call them? And like, is the case number the same and all that? I believe her case number will be the same. Because she's not in the facility anymore, I have to turn off the GA for February. So the case number is going to stay active. She'll have to reapply in Stearns. And then like, you know, to get her set up on things, she'll need like a medical opinion form probably, to try to get the community GA grants, depending on what's going on with her. But... Okay. Okay. It sounds like she's already got a bunch of that started. But... Okay. Okay, well, thank you so much. Okay. All right, have a good day.

Does that remind you? Does that ring a bell for you? Huh? No, I said, and he had the baby. I'm confused. Yeah. Why did he have the baby? I don't know. She was trusting her baby with anyone.

What's up? You called at just the right time. I did. Yeah. I've been kind of whipping around driving just kind of so sorry the last message I sent you was a text message but yeah I could probably explain better what it meant. I overlooked that. Something about Becky, Becky specifically said that if you have an idea, if you can tell, if you have an idea of what you're trying to grab you can arrange it ahead of time and like basically have available by tomorrow sort of thing whatever. Yeah. But like I've mentioned you know like you know you being you know the Dan from up north that I meet with and so yeah she knows to uh yeah to take your order basically yeah. So I know you mentioned earlier that you were trying to get like a QP for like nine. Yeah well that's what they said you know. Yeah I mean it does sound like a good price. I'll see if she can get it that for that. Well I don't I mean not right now though. I mean are you coming or not? Um no no no no no but the I guess the shit that yeah this is the yeah after fucking a Corey and my buddy that was I was with it kind of explained to me what because he had an ounce but at first he told me that he paid like this much amount for it but then he's like and then he told me like a different number and I thought he meant like two ounces but he actually paid an almost like basically almost like four hundred dollars for this one ounce and he didn't really know it until he had like weighed it. So uh yeah. So you got yeah he got kind of yeah he kind of got a fast one pulled on him because I guess this guy didn't have a fucking scale when you gave it to him or whatever but yeah yeah so he was pissed and and then that's when Becker was like yeah let's just you know if I can if he's trying to get more than you know what's here right now um you know if you can basically have it available. All right. And another thing to consider to consider is um I I don't know if I had a chance to tell you but I like work basically full-time in St. Cloud now. Oh yeah? Yeah. Yeah I wasn't like totally voluntarily but uh yeah I'm in fucking St. Cloud like five six days a week now. Yeah? Yeah. That's not bad. Uh I mean it's not bad yeah so it's okay. I'm still getting kind of like used to where everything is and all that other bullshit. What's that? Uh I didn't say anything. So I don't know do you? Say what? I don't know I'm just kind of laying here and relaxing. All right. So. Well as long as they know. Yeah so I mean if you have an idea how much so here's my my ulterior motive because I've been trying to go to the last like two weeks and my my whole arm ice fishing doesn't have a fucking good working ice house so it's like fucking it's like I can't hear you. Oh yeah I could just text you. No just text just give me a minute here. Okay. A couple seconds. So then we'll put the cover on the fucking deep fryer I guess. Make it fry faster. Okay. One more two more seconds. Okay. All right now I can hear you. You still there? Are you can you hear me? Yeah I can hear you now. Yeah I was trying to timer out for you make some burgers and fries for you. Yeah so I just made them but. Oh yeah. Yeah that would have been very kind of you dude I I'm fucking looking forward to fucking seeing you and catching up soon. Yeah yeah plus I got a bunch of mushrooms too. A trip out here. Oh yeah. For a few hours. Yeah you've never you've never you've never done DMT before? Uh-uh. Have you have you heard of it though? Maybe a long time ago. Is it like uh a clear liquid that you got to dry up or something? Well I guess it comes in a couple different forms but um I don't know if you've heard of it. If you would have heard about it a long time ago like I guess fucking they used to drink it like tea and yeah fucking I don't know if you want to go do with like the whole shaman fucking thing. But yeah it comes from nowadays you can like smoke it like in a bubble which is kind of whack but the way I tried it most recently it was like in a it's almost like a vape. Yeah and uh yeah that shit was actually pretty good. You know you take a deep hit of it and it lasts probably like I don't know it seems to last probably around like 10 minutes or less. But like when you're when you're like I don't know how to explain it like the fucking DMT DMT is like because of what it is it it's uh I guess you just got to do a little bit of research what DMT is. It's like a natural body that your natural chemical that your body produces but it produces it when you're like an infant and also when you're dying. Does that make sense? When you're dying. Yeah yeah when you're so like when you're like just a infant like you're born uh like you have like a bunch of DMT in your brain and then it eventually like goes away. You're tripping when you come into the world. Yeah and then once you when you're dying Yeah and then once you when you're dying to you know a slow death you have a bunch of DMT that gets released in your brain during that time too. And then another fucking thing is DMT is actually the only uh DMT is the one thing that you is found in every living uh thing on the planet. So there's a plant. You can't test you for it then? No no there's no test for it. I mean like yeah they don't test for that. Yeah but it only lasts five minutes is that what you said? Yeah it's like five ten minutes depending on how big a hit you take. Yeah but it's uh it's definitely pretty cool. It's not it's not like salvia. I fucking hate salvia. What's that? It's like fucking I don't know some weird fucking weed sort of shit. I don't know whack. I don't know. All right well I'm actually I do got to work tomorrow and I'm kind of like on a borderline turning into a creature. So I'm gonna try to get a little bit of rest before I have to go. Turning into a creature? Yeah a creature a meth monster. Yeah? Yeah. I've been thinking about that too. That's what you've been doing? Well I haven't been doing it but I kind of thought about it a few times. Becoming a a mess monster or something different? I thought you said a preacher. Yeah no not a preacher. No not like I'm I'm not fucking preaching the gospel. No I meant like yeah great creature a creature they are like. Oh creature? Yeah. Oh yeah. I don't know about turning into a creature but. Yeah I wouldn't recommend it either. I'd like to start a church in my garage. You want to you want to start a church? Yeah. Really? Nope. Well I'm interested to hear. You'll have to tell me more about that. Well I don't know nothing about it but I just know that if you start a church in your house you don't have to pay taxes on it. That's what the Amish do. They do a whole bunch of shit like that. Yeah. Yeah. But I suppose. Yeah. Say it again. Then I did probably say I was a Koresh. Well I mean you don't plan on uh. Screwing little balls and all. Yeah doing all the extra stuff. No not really. I mean I worked a little bit but not really. Well yeah they'd have to be at least 17. Oh my god. That's that's legal anyway right there ain't it? Well I suppose like you you yeah if you had a bunch of groupies then yeah you would be the next David Koresh because of all the firearms and shit you got at your place. Yeah. All right. All right. Well I'll give you a call and hopefully I'll hear from you in the next like day or two when you kind of know uh. Yeah. When you harness. Yeah I'll know what's going on. Okay cool. All right.

Yeah, they live in, um, fuckin', what is the, what's that fuckin' suburb that's, like, right up 35W? I, yeah, I don't know. Anyways, yeah, well, they, they fuckin', yeah, I grabbed from the dude on the right, like, almost 100%, for sure, before. I don't, I don't know. Damn. Have you talked to a homeboy at all? Um, yeah, probably, like, three days, three days ago. Uh, no, uh, yeah, he called, he messaged me and said that he was about to get it, and, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like, um. About three days ago? Yeah, I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't yesterday, it was the day before. Yeah. Yeah, and he was like, yeah, I'm about to get it, and I'll have your money, and I wasn't lying to you, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and. I feel like that is, like, kinda coincidental. Maybe, maybe I should ask. I'm gonna ask. I'm actually coming to the area right now, but, uh, I'm only passing through. I'm only passing through. What, in Minneapolis? Yeah. Why are you passing through? What are you doing? So, uh, well, I was talking with Corey earlier, and Corey is, like, I don't know, but he has drugs, and he's, like, I don't know, the other day, he, like, threw his drugs out, and, like, literally sent me, like, a video of him, like, pouring it down the toilet, and I was like, okay, whatever, good for you. Um, and then, um, yeah, and then he, I'm talking to him today, and he's like, yeah, man, I got, like, this ounce, and I don't even know what to do with it, I'm gonna go down to Kentucky, buy a chicken, I don't even know, and he's fucking this on when I'm like, dude, you ain't going down to Kentucky, and fucking give me the fucking ounce, I'll fucking, I know somebody that I can get rid of it too, so. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm gonna go basically make, like, $200 off of this thing, and and then, uh, also pick up my ice house, because I have an ice house. I bet you didn't know. Oh, you do. Yeah, I bet you didn't know that about me, huh? I did not. I bet you didn't even know. No, I don't. Yeah, no, I have actually I've been wanting to go ice fishing like the last, like, couple weeks, and I got a homeboy up that lives up in the morgue with me that I'm thinking about going with, but I don't want to go without a fucking ice house that's, like, just gay. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Huh. What the fuck? Yeah, so where's Cory at? He's, um, fucking off of university, and blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Yeah, he's not too far away. I don't know. He's, like, probably, like, less than ten minutes away from you. Why? Are you, uh, feeling social or something? You want to... I mean, yeah. I mean, it depends on what kind of condition. Uh, I suppose... I guess... If you wanted to, I could pick you up on my way there, and then I could, after we leave there, I could drop you off. That way you're not, like, signing in for, like, some Oregon trail or anything. Right. Well, I am just put in some dinner, and I got, like, three hours sleep last night. So... I'm about to probably just relax. Oh. Of course. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't sleep at all last night, either. I'm, like, running off of, like, pure momentum. And... Yeah. Yeah. Not good. I don't know. I gotta work tomorrow. I gotta be around some people tomorrow. But I'll sleep tonight, for sure. Mm-hmm. Well, sure. Anyways, um... Okay. But you can stop by if you want to. Man, that sounds really tempting. Yeah. I'd be okay with seeing you. Yeah? And I don't even care, like, I mean... So, I was thinking, if you're with him, you can stop by, too, but, I mean, that's only if he's on his best behavior. Oh, no. No, no, no. That would be, like, uh... Yeah. Yeah. Besides, I can't bring him around you. I already gave him to my other baby... to my other baby mom. Yeah. I'm good. Good on that. I don't know. Who are you else? Is your baby mama? Well... Let's just assume that if I did have another baby mama, I may have tried to wife her off or something like that. I don't know. What's the fucking... the religious term? Like, I don't know. Like, I had two sister wives. Now I don't want them. I don't know. All right. I'll give you a call. I got to punch some shit into my phone to figure out which...

And I was gonna go down to Indiana because it was like, I was gonna do party favors and I had two guys down there that had legit cash jobs for me. Okay. Anyways, so I just bought all this party favor bullshit and fucked it off. I can't get rid of this shit, dude. I gotta get rid of it. So, are you calling it party favors? Yeah, I'm calling it party favors, bro. And, um, are they just the same rolls that you had the other day? Yeah, I had the rolls, but I had like a house of some rolls. Mmm. Man. Um, let's see, I don't know. You know, it's too hard to do it, so I thought I'd try. I mean, I don't know, the ecstasy was not that, um, that great. Uh, but if it was like Molly, I would be fucking all over, I'd be at your front door right now. Yeah, I got like an ounce of that, too. You say you have an ounce of that, or are you... I have an ounce of that. Oh, right, right, right, right. Who doesn't? Man, I... I just... Before I passed out, I was gonna buy a pound, but then I passed out, I was like, nah, I should just get an ounce. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Why? Why would you get an ounce? Like, there's not enough money to be made off of that. Uh, because like, if I would've went to Indiana, and I still went, dude. Why? You have court up here. Huh? You have ongoing court cases up here. I don't have, I'm not charged yet, dude. For the DWI? I don't have a court date right now, at all. Oh. Oh, yeah. I thought you had like a DWI like a couple months ago. Yeah, but like, the thing about getting one in Ramsey County is that the county will fucking drop the like, burn the charge up, drop it, and then they release you. And then, uh, basically, wait for those drug tests, the blood tests, you know, come through, or wait for the BCA to get done with that drug test that they gave me. And then, if I'm dirty, you know, the state will pick it up. Right. So nobody's picked it up yet, so I'm just like, you know. So, technically, right now, I'm not charged as shit. Yeah, how long ago did that happen? I thought that happened like a while ago. About a month. Like, a month, out of the nuts. Huh. Yeah. The blood test takes four to like six, sometimes even longer. It's six weeks or longer. That's crazy. I don't know. I can help get you into treatment, and get you onto some services and stuff like that. I can help you out like that. Alright. That's what I'm saying in a day. I still might go to Indiana, yeah, because I can still like, that alone will pay for my food and the round-trip ticket and the cash that I make on top of what's called a fee in the bank. Yeah. Probably just go down there for a couple weeks, you know. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe, yeah, so I guess some people do that. Maybe you could do that, too. I believe you'll be successful in whatever you do. But I'm just saying, the biggest part is because, like, I haven't seen these people in a long time. Before, it's like fucking years before I've seen them. Yeah, I mean, I thought they were like my old friends. They were like family to me. I haven't seen them forever. No, they're not. They're not going to rip me off. I'll take care of it. Ain't nobody ever going to do that again. Three. You're talking about the three Hispanics, 50-some pounds, like, two days ago? Are you saying it's something to do with phones? Where? Oh, okay. Damn, dude. How do you get caught with that many fucking pills? All right. His last name wasn't, like, Leferier, was it? Yeah, I think it was something like that. Leferier? Leferier? Oh, he was with two of us, I know. Yeah, it was the two brothers. Oh, shit. I don't know. I don't know. I feel so. A grill? Yeah, like, I was a bachelor, too. You know, if somebody gave me, like, a nice one, or the ones that are, like, actually, like, stuck to your teeth, like, I'd probably do it. If I had some stupid money, I'd probably do it. At least once, you know? I don't know, I actually, I was kind of into the idea for, like, ten minutes, but then, like, I seen, like, kind of what they look like up close, like, I don't know, when you see them in fucking music videos, or whatever, you assume that they, like, go all the way around the tooth, but it's actually just, like, a fucking thing where it, like, rests just on the front side of it, and, I don't know, when I seen that, I didn't like it, so I was like, that's whack. Well, the expensive ones, they go, like, tooth by tooth, dude. That's what I thought, that's what I'm thinking. The real expensive ones, yeah, but then the clip, they got the clips, like, you're talking about, that's what us beyonds get. I gotcha. Yeah. They actually got to use one of them, like, hammer fucking things, like, to pull them out. The ones that go individually. Like, it's like a fucking rod with a fucking hook, and then, like, it's got a sliding handle. Oh, really? Like, a fucking, you're just, you're saying we need a sling hammer to fucking get the fucking grill in? Like, a specialized tool that we get from AutoZone? Yes, I am. That's serious, dude. Like, you got to use the same tool that you use to, like, get, like, wheel bearings out. Right, or just, like, regular bearings on an engine. Yeah. Yeah. Something like that, you know? Man, you're crazy, dude. Are you at home right now? Hey, bro, I'm not crazy. Can they use it? I've seen it. Dude, I'm gonna go get one of those hammers right now, and I'm gonna come over, and we're gonna make a YouTube video or something. I don't have a grill. I don't have a grill either. So, how's your day been going so far? Have you been productive today? No, absolutely not. What? I'm not ready, dude. I'm gonna clean the fuck out of this apartment, start, like, packing shit. Dude, what is wrong with you? You got weird-ass fucking ideas. Yeah, I think I'm gonna run away and join the circus, dude. I'm not gonna run away. That's what it sounds like you're saying to me right now. I'm just gonna go there for, like, a week or two, dude. It's a visit to work for cash. Hold on. So, I think if you were to reevaluate your plan and say something like, let's go to Florida for a week. Yeah, let's go to Florida. I was talking about that the other day.

Hello, Brandon. This is Aaron at the ready 1st. I am returning your phone call regarding Matthew Marcella. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I, um. Uh, was just going to touch base with you again. My intake lady, uh. I wanted to make sure that, um, I don't know. Actually, let me just confirm 1 last time that she hasn't received. The assessment. It does say it was sent and that it was received. At about 2 PM yesterday, and we're talking about generation hope, right? Not not partners. Yeah. Yeah, so generation home 61223004001. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Okay, let's see. I just kind of wait for a response on that. And I'm Eric Wilson. We already did an ROI for him, correct? Yes, you sent that to me yesterday, I believe, and I had forwarded on a request for him to be able to come into group with us, but they have requested that he complete some sort of inpatient treatment first. Right. Yeah, we, he actually, we did find an inpatient program for him. One of the things that you guys recommended was North Shore, North Lights? North Star, maybe? North Star, that's what it is, yeah. Out of Otsego. Yeah, they came all the way up and picked him up about an hour ago, hour and a half ago. Awesome. Yeah, that is really great news, actually. Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm glad. Okay, so then that is, and I know he had gone, what was the one before that that didn't work out for him? Where was that? Eosis. Eosis, okay, and was there a reason that that didn't fly for him? I just want to know, like, if there is. I think he, I'm going to paraphrase what he said, but I'm pretty sure that he said that he felt that there was other people that in the program that were using, and there was a danger for him to, in his sobriety, to stay there, so he voluntarily left. Okay, and that is okay. I just needed to, for me, like, if I'm going to send people somewhere, I want to know what we're looking at, right? I need to know. For me, I want to be able to refer them to where they're going to get the help they need, not issues. Not true. Right, I totally understand. Yeah. Okay, well, and yeah, he did make it to that transportation this morning. They picked him up at Place of Hope, and, but I, we actually had two individuals with the same first and last name come in yesterday, but luckily one was already onboarded already, but yeah, I was just kind of coordinating with my intake lady about Eric Wilson and making sure that we have his assessment. Yeah, yeah, you did send it over, huh? Okay, okay, and I got a confirmation too. Okay, okay, I think that's all that I needed for now then. Okay, if you, if you find that something's missing or you need something else, feel free to give us a call back, and I'll send whatever else you need over, okay? So, I actually was going to ask you, so you guys do walk-ins on Friday, of course. Do you guys take appointments over the phone at all, like, how do you, throughout the rest of the week, or? So, on Wednesdays is also the format of walk-in. It's different. It's done online, so you can utilize our website and have them do, like, a telehealth. We don't do a phone at all, no phone assessments, but we do the telehealth on Wednesdays walk-in style. So, it's the same kind of format as Friday, but it's not in person, and then Fridays is in person in our St. Cloud office. So, if you know of somebody that, like, comes in on a Wednesday, but we don't, typically, I don't schedule any assessments at all unless they are, like, someone who is either over the road and very difficult, and we need to schedule them an appointment, or have, like, works night and needs to have an appointment so that they can make it to the whatever, or, you know what I mean, that kind of thing. Otherwise, it's just a walk-in format, both Wednesday and Friday. Okay, that is actually extremely helpful, because, yeah, the other third party that we go through for assessments is, like, I don't, I'm not really familiar with their process, but getting back in touch with them and getting them in touch with the people I refer to them is kind of not working out in my, so, yeah. It's not working the way you thought it wanted, or the way you wanted it to. Right, right, like, when I register somebody and I onboard them on my desk, I'd like to see, like, that they, that the third party place gets in contact with them, or I at least know how to bridge that gap, so it's not just, like, right, but if I know Wednesdays is, I can, I can schedule online, or I just apply online on Wednesday from certain time to certain time. You would just, yep, from 9 to 2 is the, is the walk-in, and then if you're, I would recommend for you, like, so that you could bridge the gap that you have, it would be, like, you taking the client, quote, unquote, taking the client, right, so you would walk on to the online, so you'd go online to our website, sobrietyfirstllc.com, and I will repeat that if you need me to, and then on our front screen there, there's, oh, it says, it says schedule an assessment, ignore that button, I hate that button, and then the second one down is a walk-in, it says walk-in assessment, that's the one that you're going to click with your client present, and then from there, it's going to take you right into our Zoom link, and into, like, asking for a asking for a client name, and then joining the meeting, and having that person connect with our CPRS that takes the information, does the release of information, does those kinds of things, so that's where you would mention that, A, you want to be listed, you know what I mean, as a release of information for, for Generation Hope, and then that person would be forwarded onto our assessment, our assessor after that, there isn't a time, quote-unquote, like, I can't say, okay, if you go on at 10 o'clock, Brandon, you're going to get this person in, I can't say that, because it's still just that walk-in format, but you can certainly take them, or guide them there, does that make sense? Absolutely, dude, that is so helpful, and, and I'm also terrible with names, but so I'm going to save your name this time, but what did you say your name was again? Aaron. Oh, oh, I already saved your name, okay. It's okay, I get it. Well, thank you, Aaron, and that is actually super, super helpful. Sure, if you have any questions, concerns. Okay, I probably will be doing that on Wednesday. I do have another call coming in, so I will have to do this with you again later. No problem, have a good day. All right, you too.

No, I won money on you, dude. I won 20 bucks on you in pool. You're a piece of shit. I hate this guy right now. I almost punched him multiple times this weekend, dude. Like the last weekend I hung out with him when you were there, dude. He had a good time and I hadn't seen him in for a while. I brought him back the weekend after, dude. Dude's fucking on my breakfast, making a mess, doing this, doing that, fucking cheating me left and right, disrespecting me. I fucking hate this nigga. Right now? Yeah.

I think we've just been spending too much time together. You know what? I still love you. I still fucking love you. I've known you since I was like 12. You're still my boy. But he thinks he went to prison. So he thinks he's right. He's got like this stubborn attitude. He's like, yeah, I'm always fucking right. I'm like, no, bro. I'm like, you know how disrespectful it is for you to fucking tell me when I'm trying to teach you something? I'm trying to teach you something, bro. And you're just like, you have no regard to learn it because you're just being disrespectful and you think you're already right. Like that hurts my feelings. Right? We all have feelings. Right. It does make sense. I'm not going to hang out with him for at least another month. I'll see you next month. Where's Gabby? What about $200? You didn't win $200. No. Oh, on the poll tab. Now all says he wants to tell you he won $200 on a poll tab that he would have never bought if I didn't tell him to buy it. Oh, so he's taking all the credit. Like he's like, yeah, he's the rabbit's foot now. We went to the bowling alley to shoot some pool. That's why I almost beat him up with a pool stick. But now it's like, you know what? I know these people here would support me because he's black, but he's my friend and you can't hit your friends with pool sticks, even when you really fucking want to hit him with food sticks. And at that point, then he ended up being done with pool. I beat him in pool so many times. I made $20 off of him. And then I put that $20 in. We both threw $20 in. Basically both his whole $40, both the $200. Where's Gabby? Does she not even fucking care about me? She's coming out right this second. She's walking through the house towards the door. You should see her in about 35 seconds tops. Oh, we're at my house. So I don't think we're going to see her. You drove all the way back to your place. No, we didn't. We've been sitting here fucking thinking about things. Oh, you didn't actually come to the, come here. All right. I'm going to see her in a second. Okay. I'll see you.

Hello. How are you doing? I'm good. Yeah. How was your day? It was good. Mom picked me up from Amira's and I, I spent the night, I like spent like two nights at her house and that was really fun. That's cool. And Amira's the girl that lives in Rochester? No, she's in Ramsey. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's cool. I'm glad you were able to meet up with your, your friend. Yeah, me too. It was my first time seeing her in a long, long time. Yeah, I should probably tell you right away that my phone just got done like malfunctioning a bunch and yeah, so I would have called you probably 10 minutes ago, but it was like restarting and like shutting off and restarting and, and yeah, actually the person I was on the phone with, I got hung up on because the phone just started malfunctioning like that. But it was meant to be because I intended on giving you a call on my ride on my way on my way back home. Yeah. Yeah. But if, if it makes you feel any better, I could share something private about the person that I just got off the phone with. What is it? Okay. Well, I can't tell you who this happened to, but the person I just got off the phone with and was currently and the fetal position crying because you had walked into her boyfriend doing some, something adulterous with the person that she's been staying with for like the last six months. She caught her boyfriend cheating with like basically her best friend. Yeah. And then they were like just denying everything. Oh my gosh. Normally I wouldn't tell you, share something like that, but I guess hearing stuff like what other people are going through kind of sometimes, not that like, like sucks for them or anything like that, but I don't know, suddenly, would you rather be experiencing negative seven degree weather or walking in on your boyfriend cheating on you with, I don't know. Definitely the weather. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I, earlier I was thinking I had a pretty bad attitude about the weather, but now I'm thinking to myself, yeah, the weather's not so bad. Yeah. Yeah. My room is really cold right now and I'm too lazy to get up and turn the heater on. Yeah. So you're back in Rochester, mom picked you up? Yeah, but she had to leave like right away so she could go to work. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, was mom able to sit down with you and help you catch up on any of your homework this week? What do you mean? Well, I had talked with her earlier this week and asked her to sit down with you and so she could help you get caught up on a couple of your late assignments. I don't know, she said that she didn't have very many opportunities this week to do that, but she was going to try. Oh. Um. Well, how is school going? Well, I don't know. Actually, do you? I'm sorry. I haven't talked to you in a while, so naturally I want to like hear about everything that's going on in your life, but to be respectful. Uh. You wanted to talk about something specific right away? Kind of, yeah. Okay. Well. Yeah, by all means, let's we could skip to that and then circle back to the rest of it. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so you asked me why you haven't gotten an apology yet. Yeah. Um. Why? Well, just out of curiosity, you are part of the group chat, right? No. The family group text thing. I'm pretty sure I'm not. Okay. I'll have to look into that, I guess. Well, I did post. I did like type of response. To is what I would label as my apology. And that group family chat. Yeah. I heard about that, but that was also a I said. Well, I don't understand what's why you guys are pointing out that it's AI. Trust me, the AI version is a lot easier to digest than what. My words came out with to begin with, you know. Does that make sense? Not really. And so I guess what I'm trying to say is like I my words. Brandon Gillis's words, dad's words, like I try my best sometimes to like articulate. And like put words together in a way that they. It's like they achieve the what I'm trying to get at, but. Because of like my like sometimes with emotion and I don't know in the moment, everything that's going on, like I will tend to not be able to say it properly. So. I enlisted the help of my proofread aka Gemini. Yeah, I don't understand why that's a big deal. It's not like I. It's not genuine or it doesn't mean like the same thing. And I guess I don't know if you. Legitimately asking me like why I would need Gemini to do that and I couldn't just say whatever I got. Are you asking me? Kind of. Yeah. Well, the truth. Well, where are you going to hold the truth against me? I don't think so. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know. Oh, OK. All right. Well, I'm going to. Well, if I tell you the truth, I hope that it doesn't get held against me. But the truth is like that my feelings are also like invested into this disagreement and this whole situation. And I. My perspective and my perspective, I feel like I also deserve an apology, but honestly, when it comes to like my role as a parent, whether I get that apology or not, is not as important as us moving forward. So, yes, I would like an apology, but that's. Not. Yeah, I'm probably not going to get one. And the way I was originally using my words. Does that make sense? That's why I proof I use my proofread. I mean, kind of. I'm just like kind of confused and like what you want us to apologize for. Well, I guess if you could take from my perspective, like I. Me. I'm the concerned and loving parent. On my on my mind from the day that the time that I wake up in the morning until the end of the time that I go to bed at night. And. I, like, wonder, like, how things are going with school and how things are going with your friends and like if there's anything that you're going through right now. I'm not there to be a part of or there to help you with and. And I feel kind of powerless. And I want like. I don't know. Yeah. So I guess I'm. Things have been going. And when I do see you on Sunday. It's going to be like, I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you. And. I'm going to miss you, too. And. And. I'm going to miss you. In that way, things have been going. And when I do see you on Sunday. I understand that. There was like always a lot to. Emotion and a lot of thoughts that get packed into those visits because. It's not just me or visiting with it's also brothers and Gabby and. You know, trying to. I don't know. They can be like overstimulating, but. My point is, is like I. Yeah, when I when I go there. I. Despite like the commotion like I want to be able to connect with you guys and I want you guys to know that I'm like. Like here for you and I love you and I'm like, I don't know. And. You guys were like clearly kind of angry at the actions of the the adults like you were under the impression that we were all drinking and I wasn't drinking and. Aside from like a couple of sips out of a cup Gabby wasn't drinking. Well, you guys thought that I was. And that's. I don't know. And then when you guys felt like you mentioned that. Like you feel like you guys didn't. We're coming in like second best like I wanted to make it clear that like you guys are my, my primary people that I wanted to visit with. And I do anything to kind of clear the area and make it so we could all hang out and that's what was going on in my mind and I sent everybody away. And I don't know I just wanted you guys to be like happy and hang out with me. And you guys were like super, super crabby. And. I don't know. I guess I just got feelings hurt and said some stupid shit. Yeah, but like, even, even like then, even that you weren't drinking I was just like I just feel like like you, like all of the adults were really just like hanging out with each other and like just like really weren't hanging out with us. But I just kind of feel like that you guys are really only hanging out with each other. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I just kind of feel like that you guys are really only hanging out with each other. If I were to have left with those guys and like, left you guys to babysit the boys. I could see you guys saying that in that case, but no, I legitimately wanted to spend time with you guys and I wanted to bring the boys out there and trust me, I didn't drive three hours out there to see, to hang out with Gabby, Corey, and Kiana. Yeah, but even then, I feel like just like, really not like, when they like, when they wanted an apology for it, it was like, just the things that were like said in the argument. Absolutely. Yeah. I definitely wish we would have not said that because I, yeah, that was definitely not appropriate or accurate and if I were to ask myself why did I say that, it was coming from a place of neglect and I think that, yeah, I don't want you to think that there's any excuse for me to like, talk to you guys like that because, yeah, that's not okay. You know, I love you guys and you guys deserve respect. Yeah. Well, I appreciate that, Ad. And I love you guys and honestly, I do love you. When I make a mistake, I want you guys to know that I am not, I am an adult enough to admit when I am wrong and as much as like, as much, as fun as it would be to be like, maybe act like my mom would and be like, nah, that's on you, fuck that, blah, blah, and just kind of deflect just so that I don't have to like, be humble. I don't know. I don't think that, I think it's just be nice if you guys got the respect you deserve. Yeah. And likewise, I mean, because as a parent, there's quite a few times that I like, demand respect from you guys like, when it's like, this is your punishment or I want you to do this and even though you don't want to do it, I got to make you guys do a lot of things that you guys don't want to do, unfortunately. And I understand that you guys wouldn't do those things if you didn't respect me. So, it's like a, it's a two-way street, like, I love you guys and I only want what's best for you. Yeah. Well, I really appreciate, I really appreciate you apologizing, Dad. It means a lot. Yeah. Well, you mean a lot to me. I don't know. I really do. I mean that. I fucking think about you guys all the time. I don't know. This whole, I don't know, I've got like, lots of complaints about the way things are right now. Like, I feel like when you guys were staying with me and Mom was not seeing you guys very often, I feel like I made a lot more effort to communicate with her about things that were going on with you guys. And I feel like she does not reciprocate that for some silly reason. Yeah. Yeah. I get, like, where you're coming from, and I kind of agree. Because, like, when we were living with you, I did notice how much you were, like, trying to, like, talk to her about, like, us and stuff. But, yeah, I understand. Yeah. And I try to make sure that everything is, like, cool between her and I. Like, there's no, like, I don't know, there's no issues. And according to her, she says that there aren't any issues. So, I don't know. Oh, I guess we'll have to, me and her will have to figure out. I miss you. I miss you, too. You want to hear... Sorry, Gabby was clicking in. You want me to add Gabby to the call? Sure. Okay. All right. One second. Okay. Hello. I got a three-way call. Hold on a second. Hello? Hello? Hey, how are you? I'm good. I'm fine. I just want to let you know that I'm at the office. I'm on the phone with Gabby. I'm on the phone with Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Hello? Gabby, are you there? Oh, shit. Hold on a second. Merge. There we are. Is everybody here? Ow! Ow! Ow! Is that Alex? Yeah, it sounds like Alex. Yeah, Alex is next to me. Hey, Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Sorry, I seen you were calling just a second ago and I was on the phone with Ask. Oh. So that ΓÇô What is it? The shelf that you pulled out earlier to put back in the shower, I'm assuming. It had a toothbrush in it. What did you do with that? Threw it away. If it's important you could pull it out of the trash can. Yeah, right. No, luckily there's a couple new toothbrushes, but it was my mom's toothbrush. There is no way in hell that was your mom's toothbrush, bro. It was. She just asked me. She put her toothbrush in that nasty under-the-sink tray? Yeah, I guess. Oh, wow. That's crazy. Oh, yeah. New toothbrush. That one looked very foul. Yeah. Yeah, well, she used a new one. When you get into town, can you just pull up to the front? I need to go to Quick Trip to deposit money. Absolutely. Do you ΓÇô You know that Ashton's on the phone, right? Mm-hmm. And? Say, what up, girl? How was your weekend? Are you still at Amira's? No, you're probably home now. Yeah, I'm home. I guess. If he wants to go run out there. I'm sorry, you had fun at Amira's? Stop! All right, well, I just had those kind of questions. I love you, Ashton. I don't know. There's a lot going on here, and I don't want to ruin your guys' conversation, whatever you guys were having. Okay, I love you. Love you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay, I think Gabby just hangs up, and then naturally this turns into just a you and me conversation again. Yeah. It's so cold in my room, but I really don't want to get up. Yeah. In my head, I don't ever really do anything. I think mom just got home, I think. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey, if I were to... Remember me talking to you about the whole social media thing a little bit ago? Social media thing? Yeah, did I tell you about me getting back on social media? You did not. Um, yeah, so I'm making it a point to get back into social media. Why? Oh, like about the YouTube thing? Well, the YouTube thing, yes. But then also, like, Facebook and, um... Yeah, Facebook. Yeah, but the thing is, like, I don't want to be the... I just don't want to post things on Facebook. So, like, it's typically, like, Gemini that does most of, like, the what to say, how to make it look sort of thing. Yeah. Is any of that interest to you? Yeah, I think it would be cool for, like, why do you plan to, like, start doing social media? So I can basically build a brand, like a persona. Like, I have, like, an image that I want to portray. But yet the real brand and real life brand actually lacks the interest to actually do that. Like, I lack the interest and I don't actually see the value in, like, doing it myself or putting my legitimate feelings or thoughts out there. So I just want to put stuff out there that is, like, uh, that grabs people's attention, builds followers, I don't know, portrays... Imagine by the time you're, like, 45, you're gonna be like Bill Gates. I could. Well, so I mean, I guess I'm doing this for a couple of different reasons. But I really don't have the expertise that perhaps you guys would. So I was gonna ask if I could get you to help me in any way that you are interested in helping. Like, for example, I wanted to post... My last post I was going to put together was, like, a slideshow and, like, a thing that was kind of celebrating Alex and his potty training. Yeah, you guys are starting to potty train him? Yeah, I started to potty train him. He's actually doing, like, really, really well. It's just I basically have to potty train the adults now because they don't understand how this fucking whole potty training thing works. Yeah. He knows how to use the toilet now? Yep, yeah. Like, if I were to go, basically, he wears regular underwear. And then, yeah, he wears regular underwear. And then he goes to the bathroom in the potty, like, totally like normal. He has actually has not had a single accident while wearing those regular underwears yet. He's growing up. I know, that's what I'm saying. I'm super proud of him. He's still my baby. So, Gabby was telling me that, like, the, like, the fucking, the post that I'm trying to create is actually easily created on Instagram. And I was just gonna maybe, I'm not really on Instagram. Like, I have to totally, like, log into it and all that bullshit. If I were to send you the pictures and, like, tell you the song that I wanted to play in the background, could you create it? And then, like, send it back to me somehow? Like, you said create the song? What? I'm confused what you're asking me to do. So, there's basically, like, a set of pictures. Right? Like a slideshow. And then, uh, and then a background song to play, like, as the slideshow goes from front to back. So, you want me to, like, create, like, a video? So, you're asking me to, like, make, like, pictures, but, like, make it into a video with the music in the background? Yeah. Yeah, it's like a slideshow with the music in the background. And I guess you can do it really easily on Instagram. Yeah, I can do that. Okay. Awesome. Alright, so I can tell you the song, and then I'll tell you the song in a text message, and I'll share the photos with you on Google Photos. Okie dokie. Yeah? Yeah. And then... That sounds like a fun little side activity. Dude, that'd be so fuckin' awesome if you could do that. That'd be fuckin' awesome. Yeah, I can try. Pretty sure I can do that. I am running into this fuckin' Dollar General place right now. Well, I'm pretty sure Mom just got home, so... I'm gonna let you go, but I love you so much. Alright, I love you too. Alright, I'll talk to you soon, okay? Alright, send me the pictures and, like, what song, and I'll do that for you. Okay, I'll send it to you. Bye tonight. Okay, bye, love you. Bye.","strategic_notes":"{\"title\":\"Family Reconciliation and Social Media Collaboration\",\"summary\":\"Brandon and his daughter Ashtyn discuss a recent family conflict and Brandon's use of AI to draft an apology.

I could see you guys saying that in that case, but no, I legitimately wanted to spend time with you guys and I wanted to bring the boys out there and trust me, I didn't drive three hours out there to see, to hang out with Gabby, Corey, and Kiana. Yeah, but even then, I feel like just like, really not like, when they like, when they wanted an apology for it, it was like, just the things that were like said in the argument. Absolutely. Yeah. I definitely wish we would have not said that because I, yeah, that was definitely not appropriate or accurate and if I were to ask myself why did I say that, it was coming from a place of neglect and I think that, yeah, I don't want you to think that there's any excuse for me to like, talk to you guys like that because, yeah, that's not okay. You know, I love you guys and you guys deserve respect. Yeah. Well, I appreciate that, Ad. And I love you guys and honestly, I do love you. When I make a mistake, I want you guys to know that I am not, I am an adult enough to admit when I am wrong and as much as like, as much, as fun as it would be to be like, maybe act like my mom would and be like, nah, that's on you, fuck that, blah, blah, and just kind of deflect just so that I don't have to like, be humble. I don't know. I don't think that, I think it's just be nice if you guys got the respect you deserve. Yeah. And likewise, I mean, because as a parent, there's quite a few times that I like, demand respect from you guys like, when it's like, this is your punishment or I want you to do this and even though you don't want to do it, I got to make you guys do a lot of things that you guys don't want to do, unfortunately. And I understand that you guys wouldn't do those things if you didn't respect me. So, it's like a, it's a two-way street, like, I love you guys and I only want what's best for you. Yeah. Well, I really appreciate, I really appreciate you apologizing, Dad. It means a lot. Yeah. Well, you mean a lot to me. I don't know. I really do. I mean that. I fucking think about you guys all the time. I don't know. This whole, I don't know, I've got like, lots of complaints about the way things are right now. Like, I feel like when you guys were staying with me and Mom was not seeing you guys very often, I feel like I made a lot more effort to communicate with her about things that were going on with you guys. And I feel like she does not reciprocate that for some silly reason. Yeah. Yeah. I get, like, where you're coming from, and I kind of agree. Because, like, when we were living with you, I did notice how much you were, like, trying to, like, talk to her about, like, us and stuff. But, yeah, I understand. Yeah. And I try to make sure that everything is, like, cool between her and I. Like, there's no, like, I don't know, there's no issues. And according to her, she says that there aren't any issues. So, I don't know. Oh, I guess we'll have to, me and her will have to figure out. I miss you. I miss you, too. You want to hear... Sorry, Gabby was clicking in. You want me to add Gabby to the call? Sure. Okay. All right. One second. Okay. Hello. I got a three-way call. Hold on a second. Hello? Hello? Hey, how are you? I'm good. I'm fine. I just want to let you know that I'm at the office. I'm on the phone with Gabby. I'm on the phone with Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Hello? Gabby, are you there? Oh, shit. Hold on a second. Merge. There we are. Is everybody here? Ow! Ow! Ow! Is that Alex? Yeah, it sounds like Alex. Yeah, Alex is next to me. Hey, Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Sorry, I seen you were calling just a second ago and I was on the phone with Ask. Oh. So that ΓÇô What is it? The shelf that you pulled out earlier to put back in the shower, I'm assuming. It had a toothbrush in it. What did you do with that? Threw it away. If it's important you could pull it out of the trash can. Yeah, right. No, luckily there's a couple new toothbrushes, but it was my mom's toothbrush. There is no way in hell that was your mom's toothbrush, bro. It was. She just asked me. She put her toothbrush in that nasty under-the-sink tray? Yeah, I guess. Oh, wow. That's crazy. Oh, yeah. New toothbrush. That one looked very foul. Yeah. Yeah, well, she used a new one. When you get into town, can you just pull up to the front? I need to go to Quick Trip to deposit money. Absolutely. Do you ΓÇô You know that Ashton's on the phone, right? Mm-hmm. And? Say, what up, girl? How was your weekend? Are you still at Amira's? No, you're probably home now. Yeah, I'm home. I guess. If he wants to go run out there. I'm sorry, you had fun at Amira's? Stop! All right, well, I just had those kind of questions. I love you, Ashton. I don't know. There's a lot going on here, and I don't want to ruin your guys' conversation, whatever you guys were having. Okay, I love you. Love you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay, I think Gabby just hangs up, and then naturally this turns into just a you and me conversation again. Yeah. It's so cold in my room, but I really don't want to get up. Yeah. In my head, I don't ever really do anything. I think mom just got home, I think. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey, if I were to... Remember me talking to you about the whole social media thing a little bit ago? Social media thing? Yeah, did I tell you about me getting back on social media? You did not. Um, yeah, so I'm making it a point to get back into social media. Why? Oh, like about the YouTube thing? Well, the YouTube thing, yes. But then also, like, Facebook and, um... Yeah, Facebook. Yeah, but the thing is, like, I don't want to be the... I just don't want to post things on Facebook. So, like, it's typically, like, Gemini that does most of, like, the what to say, how to make it look sort of thing. Yeah. Is any of that interest to you? Yeah, I think it would be cool for, like, why do you plan to, like, start doing social media? So I can basically build a brand, like a persona. Like, I have, like, an image that I want to portray. But yet the real brand and real life brand actually lacks the interest to actually do that. Like, I lack the interest and I don't actually see the value in, like, doing it myself or putting my legitimate feelings or thoughts out there. So I just want to put stuff out there that is, like, uh, that grabs people's attention, builds followers, I don't know, portrays... Imagine by the time you're, like, 45, you're gonna be like Bill Gates. I could. Well, so I mean, I guess I'm doing this for a couple of different reasons. But I really don't have the expertise that perhaps you guys would. So I was gonna ask if I could get you to help me in any way that you are interested in helping. Like, for example, I wanted to post... My last post I was going to put together was, like, a slideshow and, like, a thing that was kind of celebrating Alex and his potty training. Yeah, you guys are starting to potty train him? Yeah, I started to potty train him. He's actually doing, like, really, really well. It's just I basically have to potty train the adults now because they don't understand how this fucking whole potty training thing works. Yeah. He knows how to use the toilet now? Yep, yeah. Like, if I were to go, basically, he wears regular underwear. And then, yeah, he wears regular underwear. And then he goes to the bathroom in the potty, like, totally like normal. He has actually has not had a single accident while wearing those regular underwears yet. He's growing up. I know, that's what I'm saying. I'm super proud of him. He's still my baby. So, Gabby was telling me that, like, the, like, the fucking, the post that I'm trying to create is actually easily created on Instagram. And I was just gonna maybe, I'm not really on Instagram. Like, I have to totally, like, log into it and all that bullshit. If I were to send you the pictures and, like, tell you the song that I wanted to play in the background, could you create it? And then, like, send it back to me somehow? Like, you said create the song? What? I'm confused what you're asking me to do. So, there's basically, like, a set of pictures. Right? Like a slideshow. And then, uh, and then a background song to play, like, as the slideshow goes from front to back. So, you want me to, like, create, like, a video? So, you're asking me to, like, make, like, pictures, but, like, make it into a video with the music in the background? Yeah. Yeah, it's like a slideshow with the music in the background. And I guess you can do it really easily on Instagram. Yeah, I can do that. Okay. Awesome. Alright, so I can tell you the song, and then I'll tell you the song in a text message, and I'll share the photos with you on Google Photos. Okie dokie. Yeah? Yeah. And then... That sounds like a fun little side activity. Dude, that'd be so fuckin' awesome if you could do that. That'd be fuckin' awesome. Yeah, I can try. Pretty sure I can do that. I am running into this fuckin' Dollar General place right now. Well, I'm pretty sure Mom just got home, so... I'm gonna let you go, but I love you so much. Alright, I love you too. Alright, I'll talk to you soon, okay? Alright, send me the pictures and, like, what song, and I'll do that for you. Okay, I'll send it to you. Bye tonight. Okay, bye, love you. Bye.","strategic_notes":"{\"title\":\"Family Discussion on Apologies and Social Media Project\",\"summary\":\"Brandon and his daughter Ashtyn discuss a recent family disagreement and Brandon's use of Gemini AI to draft an apology.

Okay, and then there is a packing limitation of one bag and one backpack. Do you agree to that packing limitation? How much are you bringing? Yeah, that's all I have is like a bag. Perfect, yeah, that works too. Let's see, so what's the substance of choice? It'd be like, it was alcohol, ecstasy, Xanax, like, you know, cocaine, crystal meth, it was fentanyl, like Percocet and stuff. Okay, what was the last date of use for like alcohol and stuff like that? I would say yesterday. Okay, any other substances that you've recently used? Crystal meth. And when was that? The same day, like just the other day, like within a 72-hour range. Okay, and did you like just smoke the crystal meth then? Yeah, I smoked it. Okay, do you have any allergies? No. Dietary restrictions? No. Are you able to climb, oh, I'm sorry? No, sometimes I just eat double portions, like ensure milk, boost milk, just vitamins, that's it. Okay, okay, are you able to climb stairs? Yeah. Do you use any like mobility devices, like a walker or a cane? Sometimes, sometimes I do, because I had like, I had a bad injury in my lower back and stuff, so sometimes I do, and when I go places, I normally use the elevator. So do you use, I'm sorry, you usually use, is it a cane? Yeah. Okay, and then any medical devices, like a CPAP or anything? No, I don't have one. Okay, any history of seizures? No. Any history of overdose? Yeah. When was the last time? Last time I overdosed was about a few months ago. Okay, and then are you taking any medication currently? Yeah, hydroxyzine, I take Remeron for sleep, well-building, depression, and gabapentin for anxiety, and chronic pain, I'm gonna say nerve pain, and that'll be really it, and I take mood stabilizer, Depakote, mood stabilizer. You said Depakote? Yeah, it's like a mood stabilizer. Okay, and then you take all of your medication that's prescribed? Yeah. Are any of them injectable? No. Do you have any open wounds currently? No. Do you have any upcoming medical appointments or medical conditions that require attention? Not that I know of. Just one for PTSD. Have you recently had surgery? Oh, I'm sorry? Yeah, one for PTSD, and I was supposed to get my green dot marijuana card through my doctor's interlude, but I never had a chance to go back and finish my doctor's appointment, so I just suffer with PTSD. Okay, and I'm just gonna be totally transparent, medical marijuana is not allowed at our facilities, are you okay with that? Yeah, I'm okay with that. Okay, just, okay, and I'm sorry, I might have already asked you this, so I apologize. Have you recently had surgery? No. Okay, do you have any medical conditions that require 24-7 nursing care? No. Diabetes at all? No. Ever have a heart attack? Yeah, I think I had one. What do you mean by that, like you think you had one, or like you went to the doctor and they told you you had one? Um, I think I just was having a panic attack. I don't think I ever had a heart attack. Okay. And then are you able to complete all activities of daily living? Yep. Okay, and then for mental health, any mental health diagnoses? I know you mentioned depression and PTSD. And anxiety, yep. Okay, okay. And then have you ever heard or seen things that other people don't hear and see? Sometimes when I hallucinate. Is that like outside of drug use, or is that in the context of drug use? Okay, so you only hallucinate with drug use? Yeah. Okay, and then have you ever received treatment for an eating disorder? Um, no, but when I was in Louisiana, I just had double portions. It was good to have double portions. Okay. And then during times of stress, have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or others? Sometimes, harming others. And did you ever act on those thoughts? Um, yeah, I had attempts and stuff, but other than that, I've been good. I ain't really been acting out too much. Okay, um, so with you acting on those thoughts, like when did that last occur? No, I never really had no actions like that. I just had me like, just thoughts in my head when I never really could fall asleep. Oh, okay, so you haven't, okay. Do you have any history of suicide? No. Oh, I'm sorry? No, I just said I have an attempt that is just not in me to just worry about the next person like that. I just- Right. Okay, I see what you're saying. Are you on probation or parole? Yeah, I'm currently on probation, and yep, that's like for chemical use. I'm just, I'll be off in January, but anytime soon. I've been on it for one year. I'm only on two years of it. She just want me to do treatment, and then I'll be off. Okay, and what county is it through? Ramsey County. And do you know who your PO is by chance? Yeah, her name is Melissa Soto, M-E-L-I-S-S-A, Soto, S-O-T-O. Okay, perfect, and then off the top of your head, off the top of your head, do you have contact information for her? Not a big deal if you don't. I don't have it off the back of my head, but it's what my belongings and stuff. No worries, that's totally fine. Have you ever been convicted of a CSD charge? No. Arson? No. Any active warrants to your knowledge? Nope. Are you on a commitment? Yeah. Okay, did you have a whole court process with that where someone makes your medical decisions and stuff? Yeah, just a court order just to finish treatment and stuff, that's all. But not like, here, you know what I'm gonna look, because it doesn't look like we saw one. Let me see. Do you have an ACT team? I'm gonna finish this while I do this. Do you have an ACT team or CADI waiver? No, I want one. Okay. Are you your own legal guardian? Yeah. Okay, and then do you use any alcohol or GPS monitoring devices? No. Okay, and yeah, in terms of commitment, I don't see one on your background. I mean, I get being ordered to finish treatment, but I don't, it's kind of more of like, you know, like I said, you can't make medical decisions for yourself, so I'd like to. Okay, no. Or like, for example, yeah. Okay, so you want Otsego. And where are you currently located? I'm currently located in St. Cloud at the Place of Hope. Okay, perfect. Actually, that's not bad at all. So you said you want to get in as soon as possible? Yeah, because I don't really want to keep being around these people they're using and they're stressing me out. I'm just trying to get away. Yeah. That's fair. I mean, can we do tomorrow? Yes. And can your, I don't know if he was your counselor, but can he hear me too? I just want to make sure he hears me, so at least he knows. Okay, hold on one second. Otsego. Hold on. Brenda? Hold on one second. Brenda? Mm-hmm. Okay, she just want to speak with you one second. Hold on, here you come. He can hear you. She said tomorrow. Oh, perfect. Okay, yeah, sorry. I just wanted to say we do have a bed for tomorrow, so as long as you guys are okay with that, we could do that if that works. Would I need a ride, would a medical ride? No, we actually have, we got it like, let's see, is it okay if our driver leaves at 1130 to get there around like 1230, 1216-ish? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Perfect. Is that through the Place of Hope or here? Yeah, is it, oh, I'm sorry. Pick up from the Place of Hope or? Well, it's your preference. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, we can pick up there. Oh, sorry, you asking him? I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I was asking him like whether he wanted to get picked up at the office here or at the Place of Hope, but the Place of Hope is probably gonna be the better place. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. And I just want to make sure I have the correct address. Is it 511 9th Avenue North? Okay, just want to make sure. And then, let's see that. I'm just trying to see. And then what's a good number to call to like confirm? Well, he doesn't have an active cell phone right now, but I can give you my phone number and I can confirm, like make sure he's alive and at where he is supposed to be. Are you ready? Okay, yeah, what's that? It's 320-775-9130. Perfect, so 320-775-9130? Yep. Perfect, all right. Well, then I got that all set up then for tomorrow. Actually, you know what? I'm looking at the wrong date. Okay, sorry, can I do it earlier in the morning? Like where I have a driver actually leave and get there at 8.30 in the morning? I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong day. I was looking at today. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I'm also gonna put it in. Otherwise, yeah, I can try and look and see if I've got a different driver who's got, let me look and see if I have a different driver who's later, I just don't want to. Where is he? Where is he? Okay, they're booked up, booked up. Okay, yeah, so unfortunately, he is the only driver available. And so actually what would happen is he would leave tomorrow at like around 8 a.m., probably get there at like, you know, give or take, 8.30, 8.45-ish, is that okay? Yeah. Okay. I apologize, I'm so sorry, I was looking at the wrong date. No, you're totally fine. And so yeah, he'll leave and his name's Dustin. And so yeah, he's all set up then. Pick him up and then we'll get back to you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. And then pick him up and then we'll get him. Oh, yep. And then could I get a phone number for you guys just in case like there's any questions or something? Okay, yeah, let me know when. I'm ready. You're ready. Yeah. 952. Okay. Oh, sorry. My bad, I'm sorry. 297. Don't worry. 8665. Okay. All right, so you said 952-297-8665? That's correct. Okay. All right. And so 8.45, he'll be at Place of Hope, Dustin. And, okay. Do you want his phone number as well, just in case? Sure. If I can give you his phone number as well. Yeah, let me know when you're ready for his phone number. Go ahead. Oh, 763-600-1265. 1265, Dustin Driver. And when they, is he going to be in like a personal vehicle or like a van or what's? Yeah, it's probably going to be either a Ford Escape. It's like one of those like smaller Ford SUVs. It's either, yeah, I think it's a Ford Escape. But yeah, he will definitely call because we'll also call tomorrow to confirm. But it should be all good to go. I will say, and I just want to make sure Eric's aware of this, that kind of like what we've been doing is how we do it is we have all of our people go to Eden Prairie first just to get medically cleared. And then once they're at that facility and they're medically cleared, we get them to where they're going. So like, for example, he's going to be at Sego. So as long as he's medically cleared by our nurses tomorrow, he will go to Sego tomorrow as well. All right, I understand. Yeah, so I just, I wanted to make him aware. So it's not like, oh my gosh, where am I going? What's happening? And then you got, I don't know if you guys actually went over this already, but do you guys have a 30 day program or 60, 90 inpatient program? What do you, does he already know what he's signing up for? Yeah, I mean, so our program is 30 to 45 days. Oh yeah, cool, cool, cool. All right. Yep, and so, is there any other questions? Cause I mean, just for dual diagnostics, so focused on both mental health and chemical dependency and then he'll get a counselor for each. So just kind of some tips. You guys got it all taken care of. And let's see, is there an ROI that you guys can send to my organizations so I can, we can like communicate with you guys and for continuing care purposes? Yeah, well, yeah, if you want, cause do you guys have ROI there or do you want, I mean, you can print out one of ours. We have one on our website. Otherwise if you just use one of yours and have them sign down and just fax it to us, that should work. Okay, that sounds like something my supervisor can figure out, but yes, that's something. Yeah, let me see it. Otherwise we, on our website, I will tell you, it is under resources and it's under client forms and literally it does release of information. So, and there's an online form that you can fill out, so just a heads up. Okay, and then I didn't, I'm sorry, I didn't get your name either. Oh, it's Juliana. Juliana, cool, awesome. Well, then I think I have, so I guess we're confirmed for tomorrow at 8.45 AM. If we have any questions or concerns, we'll reach out to Dustin and also feel free to give him my phone number and- Oh yeah, I put your phone number on the appointment so he'll be able to see it as well. So you guys, like I said, he'll probably call you tomorrow because not only do we call, but they also call because they don't want to be driving somewhere, things aren't confirmed. So just expect some phone calls tomorrow morning. Okay. Thank you. Awesome, all right, thank you. Absolutely, and if any other questions arise, please, please, please do not hesitate to reach out as we just want him to be as comfortable as possible coming in. For sure, thank you. Thank you for helping us out with this. It's awesome. Absolutely. But yeah, well, you guys have a good rest of your day and yeah, we'll be seeing you tomorrow. All right, thank you. You too.

How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing okay. So, I'm actually, my name is Brandon Gillis. I'm calling on behalf, I'm with Generation Hope, calling on behalf of a client named Eric Wilson, and we're just trying to get some more information about your intake process and if you guys have any beds available. Yeah, absolutely. So, as of right now, I do not have a bed available, but I do have some mails that are supposed to be scheduled, and let me see if this person, okay, sorry, I was just trying to see if there was any update on the person that's scheduled right now. So, as of right now, we don't have any beds available. That doesn't mean that we're not going to have a bed later tonight or tomorrow morning. Things do change very quick. How this works is, I don't know if he's ever been with us before, but let's just say he hasn't. So, we would start by creating a chart, and then we would go through an intake screening. So, asking him a bunch of questions about how he's feeling today and about his use, and then at that point, we would move forward from that. Okay, I understand. And then, you also, like, represent more than one facility. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. We have one in Ember Grove, and then we also have one in Brooklyn Park. Excuse me. And the one in Brooklyn Park, is that a males facility? Both of them are co-ed. Oh. Okay. The rooms are separated by gender, though. Right. Of course, of course. I'm actually an alumni at the Waverly facility. Oh. It's a really nice facility. It is nice, yeah. I frequently recommend people go into that place. What about the ones you're talking about, the co-ed ones? They're all co-ed, but it's not like, even though they have men and women at the same facility, like, they don't do their, they don't interact with each other. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I have Eric with me right now, if you want to do those intake questions now, or if that happens later. However, do you want to, yeah, we can move forward. We can definitely do one with him right now, and then let's say if all of my men show up tonight, and we have to either get, I don't see any discharges as of right now for tomorrow, but I can get his intake done. And then once we do get closer and we're able to schedule him, you would just have to update a couple of questions as far as last date of use and current, like, are you hallucinating, having any suicidal ideation, so anything that can really change in a couple of days. Okay. So then I can actually just hand the phone over to him right now. And then you guys hit it. And I understand that even though you don't have availability right now, something could open up in the next day or two or three, and then you would give us a call back. For today. So that would be something where he would continue to call us. So right now I have one at four that's supposed to be showing up, but he does not show, or I'm sorry, I have one at three that's supposed to be showing up. And if he doesn't show up by 3.30, then at that point I have that bed available. So he could definitely try calling later today, or I would suggest right away at 7 a.m. tomorrow when we start taking calls, because anybody that leaves overnight, those beds would then open up. And it rotates very quickly sometimes. Yeah, absolutely. It would be calling back the same number that I called you on right now. Let me give you, I'm assuming it's not our direct admissions number. So let me give you that one. Whenever you're ready. Yeah, yeah. All right. It is 519993537. You did say 651, right? I did say 651. Yep. Okay. Okay. Even though I say Waverly, I understand. Are you looking for Waverly? Are you looking for detox? Are you looking for a program? Not detox. We're looking for like an inpatient or outpatient programming. Never mind. Okay. That would be a different department. So they may have an opening within the next week or something like that. We're detox. Oh, okay. So that's what, yeah. So you are, it's very different than what I said. Right. But I guess this is detox. We're talking to the detox intake and not like the IOP or inpatient program. Yeah. I mean, I know that they do do transportation when it is available. Yep. Okay. So in order to do the intake, that's not the detox. Do I just call the different, totally different phone number and start over? I will transfer you. So don't worry about that. I'll transfer you. I'll stay on the line. I'll let you get to someone. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Absolutely. One moment. I was trying to ask what they come to the same. I even on brand. I'm right there too. That's cool. Okay. Oh, sorry. Hi, this is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Good. How can I help you out? So I'm calling Brandon Gillis with Generation Hope. I'm calling on behalf of Aaron, Eric Wilson, who is with me right now. And we're getting some more information about, we just had a CD assessment done. And that assessment was sent out to a couple of different places. And we're just following up to try to get more information about the intake process. Yeah. Let me take a look. Yeah. Okay. When was the assessment sent? I think it was sent yesterday. Right. Yeah. Sent out Friday. Okay. And I think it would have been coming from sobriety first. Okay. What was his date of birth? 12. 13. 1990. Eric Wilson, correct? Yes. Eric Wilson. Okay. And I have him with me right now. I don't know if you want to talk to him. I can just hand the phone over. You're good. I'm just seeing if we received the assessment or not. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'm not seeing anything that's been processed since Friday for him. Most likely. It looks like he was with us not too long ago. So we'll probably need to get that assessment and then staff it with a treatment director to see which sites we could get into. Okay. Okay. And then. Let's see. So. In case. It wasn't just automatically sent to you guys. Right. Is there an email or a fax number that. We can send that assessment to. Which would be easier. Fax or email for you. Definitely email. Okay. So I would just send it to Clark. Which is C A. RC. And I think that's it. And then. I would just send it to. You guys. Is there an email or a fax number that. We can send that assessment too. When we do get it. Which would be easier. Fax or email for you. Definitely. Email. Okay. So I would just send it to. Which is C. A. RC. And I think that's it. Okay. So I would just send it to. At. E. O. S. I. S. Recovery. Dot com. Yeah. Your phone actually broke up. Like the first part of that. I didn't get anything before recovery. Dot com. Okay. C. A. R. C. Okay. Add. Which is E. O. S. I. S.

Thank you for calling sobriety first. This is Aaron. Hi, Aaron. This is Brandon Gillis with Generation Hope. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Wonderful. Wonderful. So I'm actually sitting with a client right now, and I'm just kind of following up. Because he was staying at the Lincoln Center. He did his intake over there, and he says that he... But now he's at the Place of Hope, but he was saying that while he was at the Lincoln Center doing that intake, somebody from Sobriety First was able to do his assessment while, like, over there. When was that? Thursday or Friday. And I guess we were just following up with that to see if you guys have his information. Sure. Who is the client? The client is Eric Wilson, and he's sitting with me right now. Okay. Hi, Aaron. Are you still with me? I am. I just don't have... I'm releasing my information for you, so I can't share anything with you. Maybe I could just put you on the phone with him? Yes, if he's there, that would be just fine. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that I said that part. Yeah, go ahead. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is this Eric? Yeah, this is me. Okay. So we did have your... We did do your assessment and forwarded it to the places that you requested. My understanding was that you were getting a ride to treatment. Is that not true? Yeah, but I had just did med patients, so they felt like by me already doing med patients that it wasn't going to work out. So they just wanted me to go do what I got to do to go to outpatient. Okay. Let me see. So I'm back in St. Cloud now. But your assessment says... I believe it said inpatient. Let me look. Yeah, but they had already asked you to do the residential, so I don't know why the residential would have turned you away saying that you were doing it. You know what I have to do from this step now? Do y'all have places for people to go to besides the place of hope for people to be? Because I'm sleeping on the mats and I'm around people that's using it, trying to be strong and stay focused. I can ask the admissions team if they'll be willing to change the 3.5, but I don't know if that's going to be the case. We don't necessarily have any housing that we work with or anything like that. So I thought that would be able to get you out of where you're at, but like change place. Have you checked in to change place yet? Where's it called? Change place. Change place? How do you spell it? C-H-A-N-G-E and then place. Okay. Let me see if I can. I'm working from home today, Eric, so I don't have all my references. They're all at work. So we're living, change as possible. But they are going to require that you're in some sort of treatment. You know what I mean? Yeah. Let me get you a phone number. Phone number for St. Cloud area, 320-527-0000. Okay. So, I mean, if you want me to, I will send a ticket out and see if we can do an outpatient service for you. But I don't know. I mean, I could try it. Okay. That'll be good. Okay. So I'll send a ticket off to the team, to the admissions team now, just stating that, you know, you're interested in our programming, seeing if we can still do that. But in the meantime, I would call the change place if you want to get out of place to hope and see what we can do. The other, the other thing is that the recommendations for your assessment are all going to be inpatient places because that was the recommendation. But I feel like, let me see. Like, do they have outpatient with allergen? That's what I was going to look at, see if, if what your, what your assessment is and what it looks like. Let me see. And where's the recommendation letter? We don't necessarily have, we don't necessarily have the recommendations. She just said, these are the ones that are inpatient. So, North, our regional project turned about, I don't know, where did you end up starting? Of this assessment. Yeah, yeah. Request for generation hope. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, let's do that. Let me see. Okay. Yeah. Lunch. What do you be having for that I eat some noodles good thing I eat some. Yeah. Okay. Here. Alright, so let me see here. Make sure I have your email. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come through. There. Okay. Hi. Oh my goodness. Okay. So, I have a, I have a Jasmine. Yeah. Okay, hold on. Okay, go ahead. Thank you. What. So it's legit. Legit. Uh huh. And G I L L E s. Jill G I L L E s. Yeah, live and live.com so it's legit gills G I L L E s at live.com. Okay. So, backspace a gillette G I L L E s at live.com. Right. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Okay. All right, I just sent her over. Okay. I'm going to sign at the bottom. It's a very, very small little based on the very bottom of that. As soon as I received that, then you have them at your release of information. I can send over the. If you want me to send that Eric, I just don't know. Yeah. So that you can have that. Are you then going to help him with. Yes. Yeah, whatever that, whatever your recommendation says is what we're going to be following through with. Well, the recommendation says inpatient. So. Okay. Project turnabout was one of those places as well. Was there. Yep. Yep. We turn. We, we sent it forward to. Let me see. Replacement. Okay. And then I do not know what. Eden is, but we sent it there. Okay. Yeah, that's a place. In the cities. Okay. So in order for those three places. Okay. And. I am so sorry. The connection is kind of crappy. What's up. So in order for us to. I say if it was project turnabout. So we just got to get in touch with them and then make arrangements with them at that point. It's pretty simple, right? Correct. Yep. You can reach out to them and just see if they have availability. So if they have a bed available. And then coordinate, you know, obviously, when that looks what that looks like, and then a ride. Okay. I just didn't know if that was still something that he was interested in, or if we wanted to just do. With the assessment. So, well, that's definitely a conversation. You want to. So what she's asking is she, her recommendation, and the assessment suggested an inpatient program. And it sounds like you're requesting an outpatient program now, which is like a lower level of care. But I guess we're asking you because this is a decision that you would have to make. Yeah. I'm going to do outpatient because I just did inpatient. Yeah, we're going to do outpatient. All my probation officers want me to do is my last step. Okay. All right. And then I'm. Does the assessment need to reflect the outpatient then rather than an inpatient program? I don't know. I don't know how that works on that. Typically, they can request a lower level of care without having that have to be changed. If you if you run into a situation where they're having issues with that or he's having issues with that, you can always call me and I can have Karen change it. But they should be just fine. And I tell him I will forward that, like I said, I'll get it on to our inpatient or our outpatient programming. Just now. But then we wouldn't we wouldn't have any ability for him to state we have no logic. So. Okay. Okay. I understand. So we're actually looking at this ROI right now. It's open. And you're familiar with the intake email for Generation Hope. Yes. Sorry, I don't know if you get asked that question like 12 times a week or not. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no. It's been a thing for us. So on our for like when Heidi comes over, we have. We have the email just not on. The ROI, for whatever reason, it does not cross over onto the ROI but on my contact sheet I have the email so I do know the email is just not on that. Okay. Okay, so I don't need to, I don't need to change it on this on this ROI I'm looking at right now. If you want to add it to that'd be fine. If you want to. And then, because, and then would it be possible to also make put a note to update that assessment so that it recommends CPRS services as well. It does on. If you want to receive it you'll notice, you'll, you'll see assessment for placement it does say utilize peer services at the very bottom of it and also utilize peer services as needed peers, it says utilize peer recovery services as needed on the very bottom. So, all right, so I'm going to have Eric step forward and do his digital signature on this thing and then. Okay. Then I can send it, I will send this over to you if you want a copy of the assessment. Yes, please. I don't have a recommendation letter so the recommendations are in the bottom corner on the left of the whole thing down at the bottom. And I okay to be a witness on this. You don't need to witness anything it's fine. Okay. We don't need a witness. I will skip that part. Yeah, sorry I didn't, I didn't say anything. All right, so staff signature that sounds like you guys. Me. There should be like a send back or return or something. Okay, submitted that. Hopefully I didn't mess that up because those are still a little foreign to me but I got it here. Look. Oh yeah no you're good. I see what you did. You're fine. But it may not let me open somewhere. I'm so sorry, by the way, I didn't get your name. Oh, I'm. That's okay. My name is Aaron. Okay. I'll write it down for you to. Okay, so it sounds like you got the ROI, so it's all good. And then you were able to send that assessment to me and my intake coordinator lady. Yeah, it's gonna. If it's okay with you, it may be till tomorrow before I can email that assessment over to you I don't know, because right now I'm working from home and I don't have access to our email. I'm trying to figure out how to get it to you. Maybe I can get it from from me to Trina and then Trina can forward it on from the actual email for work because otherwise you're getting my personal email and I mean, I don't mind it but I just don't want everybody to think that that's the way to get a hold of me. That's not right. And so, um, let me see what I can do and I'll try and get it over to you guys yet today. No problem. Okay. And thank you for for all that. Yes, yes. Not a problem. Appreciate the help. If there's a, I'm going to share the, your number and name and number with Eric in case he needs to get ahold of you in the future. Eric, do you have, can I have your number just in case because I did forward on a ticket to our outpatient services admission team to see whether or not they would be willing to do the outpatient for our facility so you can take my dad, my emergency number is my arm. I don't have a place to be. Yeah, he doesn't have it doesn't have a working phone line at the moment. Gotcha. So it'd be like his emergency contact phone number. That would be his best one for now. Do you guys want that. Okay. Yeah, just in case. All right, it's a 504-201-9035. Okay, perfect. All right, so when they get back in touch with me I can get back in touch with him and at least let him know that that's an option if he's interested. Otherwise I'll send this over to you momentarily. Okay. Oh, do you know do you have a fax I could fax it over from my system I just can't email you know you have a fax right up here. I bet I'm willing to bet that we do. I'm. Give me a moment I find out really quick. You're fine. Absolutely. Okay. I love technology. I just asked six people. If we just have, I just asked six different people if we have a fax number. So hopefully. Yeah. Oh, okay. I do get it. I did get a response. Okay, so I will fax that over to that number I where it goes to you guys I don't know, but I will fax that over to you. Okay, so I will fax that over to that number I where it goes to you guys I don't know, but I'll send it over to you now. Just know, we do typically email them over because I know that you guys like that by email to go to your intake team. But just because of where I'm at and circumstances today, I prefer to just use the fax today if possible. So, okay. Um, and then otherwise, we'll, we'll be good. So, um, okay, I'm super thank you for all that I do have another one last follow up question, because I actually I sent us another client, your way, you did a walk in on Friday, and somebody got the ROI filled out for generation hope. And I guess I just wanted to follow up and make sure, because I think he said that there might have been a hang up or something. Client's name is Matthew, Matthew. I don't know why I'm blanking his last name. Last name starts with an M. And if, if you want, I can hold off on asking questions until he's actually here with me, which would make better sense. Okay, hold on. Is it Matt Marcellus Marcellus Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, no he signed a release. What is it that he. What was his question or what is your question. Well, just that, uh, that it got over to our intake coordinators was the, did he sign an ROI for us and all that, and did it all get sent over. He signed a release for you guys. We did not send it to you the assessment, but I can send the assessment to you. So, I'll send that one after I send over Eric's to you. Okay, that one too. Okay, cool cool thank you. All right. All right. Is there anything else Brandon are you good to go. Good to go. This time for sure. Thank you so much. No problem. You have a great day. You too.

It's the day of making dreams, you know, dreams to reality if you want it to be. I feel like that's the way to look at it is, you know, I feel like since he passed away today, his dreams never had a limit to be put on it. So, like, they could be whatever you want it to be. Like, it can grow as far as you wanted it to. I don't know. I've got a different way of looking at things a little bit. I've seen this one meme this morning that said, like, I guess my employer doesn't think my dream, any dreams matter because I have to go into work. Well, yeah, man. Good morning. Yeah, yeah. This is my number. I got you saved in as a contact, too. I got you saved in as a contact, too. Yeah, I don't really, I might be at arms today if you are. Yeah. I left my bag there. I have my damn charger I left there. Fucking it has all my important shit I left over there. So, I got to go over there and get that. You know where you left it? It's in Alex's office. Okay. I guess I could actually grab it and run it out to you if it would help you at all. But I'm going to be running around a little bit. Yeah. You know, I'll set it as a motivator to actually get out of the house today. You know, if I see you, I see you. Um, but yeah, um, yeah, is there? Yeah, yeah, there was actually something. Because if you remember, I had to do a recovery wellness plan for you. Kind of just based off of our conversation. And, um, and, um, yeah, actually, so I need you to take a look at that. So that I can have you sign it and kind of like, uh, no, no, it's not. It's, uh, but it's like, yeah, it's definitely easier for me to just show you in person. That way, if there's like something different, I want to, you want me to put on there? Because this is basically like, what is your insurance is going to see this. And, um, okay. And, uh, so, so you're not, you're not working, right? Oh, no, I, uh, I need to find a job very, very ASAP. Oh, yeah. It's yeah. Yeah. Well, um, let's see. I, uh, I know a guy that actually that's in the area. He's like a contractor. Well, anyways, he does, he does construction and he's got like more work than, than he can like handle. He needs a hard worker, dude. I'm a hard worker. I damn. So you set a goal. If I can then, if it's, uh, in town, like commute, it's not them. Like I have to go all the way to the cities and shit. Cause I obviously don't have a car, but by, if I can them, if I can have a place to be a time and what to do, I can get it done. You sure? I mean, I can, I can, it sounds like it'd be a good opportunity. Yeah, no, it's, if it's an opportunity, I just got done working from Grady. It's just, um, like, dude, I had a whole house, damn 12 months, damn lease on that shit. And fucking, I don't know. I just got my head and mixed in with a bunch of people that, you know, I was trying to get you know, I shouldn't have, and then let their view get, get to my damn way of how I should move my life. And I altered my growth and I fucked it all up and fucking, but everything's for a reason. So, um, I've been looking for good, uh, job opportunities since, but like, I grew up off of like horse farm, like my mom owns a horseback riding stable. It's like, I know, I know schedule on no fucking, you know, a hard work. That's what I do. I like hard work. That's cool. Damn. Damn. I didn't know that about you. Yeah. Yeah. It's actually some kind of somewhat, somewhat in common, I guess you could say. I mean, I didn't grow up in like the farming thing, but that was actually like my first, uh, business that I ever owned was like, uh, it was like a farming business, but I could tell you twist to it. Horseback riding. Hey, it's a killer. It's a fucking killer. Damn. Uh, it's, it's like horseback riding. Like she has this big trail and she fucking, she pays or people pay her to ride the trail and like, damn, like it has Jim mining and like, you know, a petting zoo. Like she's added all that throughout the years, but fucking, you know, it's, it's different. It's like not really, really farmed. I guess. Is she able to do that? Like all by herself or does she have like, she's got 180, 80 horses. Like it's, it's, it sounds like it's small business for the way I'd pitch it off, but like, it's just hard for me to talk about it because I don't really talk about my family anymore because there's just something I gotta let go. But you know, she's, she's a damn multi-million dollar fucking company. Damn. You can search her up too. It's, it's called the Ponderosa in Peter Ford's, Tennessee, you know, pop, he'll pop right up the fucking horseback riding. Damn. That's her. That's cool. Um, but yeah, I really need a job. Well, yeah, I, I, I can probably help sort you out. I, um, but I guess I got your phone number now. Where are you, where are you fucking living? Like how far away from the office do you live? I live by, I live by river station. So just by Talahi. Yeah. University. Oh yeah. Okay. I know that one. All right. Uh, well, so you say you're gonna, you're gonna kind of mosey over to the office sometime today? Yeah, no, I'm getting, I'm getting ready for the day now. I just, I honestly like, yeah, I gotta get up for the day and you know, my mind, I'm not scrambled eggs, but no, I'm not, no judgment, dude. I'm fucking driving right now and I'm like multitasking like a motherfucker. So yeah, I'll get in touch with you though. Yeah, for sure. For sure, dude. And if I, and if you don't get in touch with me, like I'm going to stalk you like a fucking, like the terminator. All right. Well, you know, I'll be damn, I'll post my billboards right out here.

Hello. Sorry. It's much better now. Okay. Yeah, yep. I can hear you now. Sorry about that. Yeah, so, um, I. So when I was submitting all my notes last night like, and our WP is. So, she said that this person that she, she said that somebody came into the office yesterday, and she like knew had like a personal relation with them so she said that she couldn't do it herself. She wouldn't like. So, I'm gonna introduce you to Brandon, and I could, and I was almost certain that she said her name, his name was Coda. And when I was looking around on like the percent of, I couldn't find anybody named Coda so I was like okay maybe she said, Cody. So I found this person named Cody who was approximately the same age. And it was like 1130 at night. So I couldn't like collar. I was just pretty confident that that was the name. So I did my job note and my recovery wellness plan for a person named Cody. And then as soon as I was done, like, I realized that I had this person's number in my phone but I didn't, I don't think I saved it correctly. Because I like looked on Facebook, and, and the person who I was supposed to be doing the DAP note for popped up on my Facebook as somebody I may know, and it was like Coda, something like that. I'm almost positive that I put it as put a, I created a DAP note and a recovery wellness plan for somebody that is not the person I met yesterday. Yesterday. I don't see. I don't see any wellness plans from yesterday. I see one for Janelle McCarter on 114 which was two days ago. But otherwise, I don't, I don't see anything so hold on, can I can I ask you something. So, I had a conversation with Lacey this morning, where there was a question about a client 1730 to be added to your list and that was what I texted you about. And their name is Dakota Barnes, is that who you're referring to when you say, Yes. Okay. Okay, all right, but I'm okay so we got that figured out but like, I don't understand. I don't see you said you did wellness plans in percentage, but I don't see them on here. Yeah, they should be. Basically I created them, I put like one line in there, and then I was going to add like the rest of the stuff to it today. I don't see. I don't see anything. Because when I because because because when I click on because because when I clicked on their name. They had been seen twice, once in June by Rachel and once in September by someone named Gabriel. I don't see anything on. And again I think that was the reason why, let me look at my text I think that was why Lacey had. I talked to her this morning. I don't know, because I know that I did create them. It would have been, and I was like, I was like, wanted to make sure that they were all submitted, you know, the day of so I like kind of cheated a little bit and I just like created them and I put like one line in there and then I saved it and. Yeah, I mean, I'm. Again, maybe I could maybe I could make sense out of it more when I like open my thing. Yeah, I would definitely pull up your screen or screens. I mean, that's still though that's weird, because they, they, they auto save, you know, so even if you didn't like intentionally save it when you signed it at the bottom or lock it, it would still still should be there but I don't see it. I don't see any like. Or, or, which is like a feature to like track like the hours for people, and then, or I didn't see the service line which is like the note that's attached to it. What about the depth notes, the depth notes aren't showing up either. That's what I'm saying yeah that's what I'm saying that's what I'm referring to yeah there's no depth note either. Like, in on everything that I'm looking at on his screen on his chart, there's the last time he was seen was in September. So, so I got a chance to that person. Yeah, I mean, like no but again like when I'm looking at your screen then there's there's that doesn't show any of that either. So, hold on one second, let me, let me look at your appointment block. Yeah, I mean it's not on there either. And so I mean at the end of the day, the solution to all of that would just be to to do the note for yesterday, and to do the, the wellness plan for yesterday as well. So if you mean you say you did it or you try to do it and you started to do it like that's not necessarily like relevant in the sense of like it just needs to be done. So, and he is added to your list. So, you will be able to create that. And, yeah, you can just, you know, I mean, text me or let me know when it's done. But if you could do the, the wellness plan as well that would be great. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. I'm going to let you go. I'll talk to you later. Okay, call me if you need me. Okay, sounds good. I'll talk to you soon. Okay.

Like, I haven't **** nobody. Nobody knows where he's at for like three days and he might be out like walking in the cold or doing some stupid **** because uh I don't know but he really like, I don't know the big milestone is like he he does have some mental health issues that are that are like pretty clear and you know, he's got some court things going on right now and and uh yeah, it's like II would hate to see him go to prison for some stupid **** because he would be in in uh in a cell just one of those guys just screaming like I don't belong here and that's true.

Like uh yeah, he he's, you know, a little bit of a skateboarder, you know, uh snowboarder and that's kind of his vibe and and you can tell like, you know, he he must, he must have been in a couple of accidents and it's not that he has told me he was in an accident. He has uh problems with his memory is what he told me. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, as far as his sobriety, I don't really, I don't really couldn't really tell like you can you can tell some days, I don't know like uh uh some days like you'll you'll get him on the phone and this is a big thing and because like naturally, nobody wants to be rude and like but you'll get him on, you'll get him on the phone and he'll just like and he'll **** like ramble and ramble and **** ramble, ramble and you're like, you want to be polite.

So, I mean that it's uh it's very new but it's I don't know, very fulfilling but I don't know II uh I don't want to say I get attached because I definitely uh his problem is his problems but I definitely like to see that guy succeed and I feel like his next few steps is managing his court situations which are kind of like uh like any any court situation like if he's talking to a public defender or something like that like I would highly highly actually it was almost like I don't know if I don't know if the word is required but like you gotta be there to like interpret what that public defender is saying to him and yeah yeah because he does not under **** stand at all. Yeah. Yeah. And I've talked to his public defenders. I've talked and I've I've done. I've done all of that and um yeah and he and the one time that I don't go there because I was like I wasn't sure if it's court hearing like uh like **** significantly back pedal. It just all kind of went backwards but uh and uh and uh that's what the email is about. Like, I'm going to basically put together like uh you know, his court dates, you know, uh some details about the court dates and you know, phone numbers and um I don't know. I got I have like uh with his permission, I have all of his like personal information like a social security card, driver's license. Um probably like obviously that kind of like a personal personal. I don't know what you would call it but yeah and so it's so it keeps things simple again. So, it's court hearings and like initiating these mental health and uh steps, you know, try to get him like process for like uh those assessments for like so you can get approved for housing. Yeah. Right now, he's he has no housing and he has a dog. Um yeah. So, I know that housing is he's on their radar but he missed their last appointment. So, yeah. Um yeah, that's like another thing to follow up on like immediately. Yeah. Um does he have finances? Yeah. Yeah. He does. He gets a $900. Uh I don't know. It's like uh I think it's some sort of like disability but he gets like yeah, $900 on the first of every month and that's like uh and he usually gets it on a card but sometimes he'll lose the card and he'll have to get a new one and he that's happened probably six times out of the year. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So, yeah, this guy will keep you **** really super busy and um and honestly, if there comes a situation where like, I don't know you he needs assistance in the middle of the night or something crazy **** like that. I I can I can make myself available and in those cases and you know, kind of captain sort of thing. Yeah. I don't know. So, what are your thoughts? Uh do you have any thoughts on this so far? Uh not really. I mean, it's just basically uh I just gotta yeah. Just get to know him and know what's up and then just go from there. Like I mean, Yeah. I'm not too worried. I just gotta figure out what needs to be done. I guess, you know, like, yeah. So, another thing. Um uh so II had another client um that is in the area. Her name is Cassie Jacobson and when I when I transferred her to Bella who's another one of our coworkers um like I was able to make like uh like a three like we did a basically did a three-way call because you know Bella called Cassie. Cassie's like, huh? And then Cassie called me and she's like, what's going on? And I was and then I explained to her again. I was like, you know, I gotta I had to move up. I had to like switch offices. So, this is the new person like this person is **** awesome. You can trust this person like and then we just kind of like, I don't know, just kind of talk on the phone and just a little just about nothing important but just kind of about getting to know each other and because like a big thing is trust and like, I don't know. He's yeah, he's going to he might be a little skittish and about trusting people and like he thinks that like people are going to **** throw him in the like cell or **** bring him to a hospital and he's going to get locked up and all these things are things that make him nervous but like if you're if you're that guy that goes and picks him up when he's on the side of the road like he'll **** trust you forever. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I try to get him into more recovery things but like one day he hates the idea. One day he's interested and I'm like, I don't know as long as he's like I can have a conversation with him and I can and I know for sure he's not **** high as hell because that's great. Those are those days are good. What's his DLC? Math. Math. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. But he's definitely it's yeah, I can't. I mean, like I said, I can't really tell. I mean, it's only tell I think is when he **** rambles and when he starts to ramble and ramble and ramble, I get suspicious and I'm like, I don't know if this guy's sober and but other days, he's totally fine. I don't know. Well, between that and mental health or you know, I don't know. Yeah. You know, I think it's sometimes, you know, they get in a manic stage and that madness. I mean, do it like 6 months. It takes over 6 months to get out and recover from that. Yeah. To start recovering. You know what I mean? Just your mental and Yeah. Yeah. And this is kind of another one of the things like about getting hold of him like he does have a phone. I think he needs to get a new phone because he kind of **** it up a little bit too much but like he's got a working phone line and but II like to personally, I personally don't like to like that on my social media. Yeah. But I had I had to with him because it was like otherwise, it was almost like a no way of getting a hold of him sometimes. If you make plans with them, is he pretty pretty good at sticking with him or I mean, this is the way I would make plans with him like I would talk to him the night before and and like be like, okay or actually no. Actually, I have done this. I'm like, okay, your days are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday every morning. So, and I'll talk to him the night before, you know, I'll call him before I like I leave the house and and that's that's been pretty solid because if he knows, if he knows Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are your days with him, that's his time and if he picks up those days and it's on him like he's pretty good at that. He's really, really pretty good at that but you have to like set these boundaries with him but at the same time, try not to give up on him. I don't know. Yeah. No, I ain't I ain't going to give up on anybody but It's really easy to like let somebody get lost in the system and like that's what I I had talked with Miles like a couple times like just kind of concerned that he's going to like lose interest or **** fall into a like a depressive state or something. Yeah. Yeah, I know II think it'll be good. I relate really good with people. So, All kinds of people. So, I think I think it'll be alright. Um I mean, if he's okay with me, I don't, you know, I don't I don't like dress up or nothing like that. You know what I mean? I just kind of like who I am and you know, so good. Yeah. You know, like, I don't know. Some people are like, oh, you don't think I'm like professional but I don't know. I'm just always always got something cruising on. You know what I mean? Like, you know, so um I'm just pulling up to my next appointment. So, yeah, yeah, that's good. Um we're sending over whatever. I have a little more time this afternoon if we need to um touch base or whatever. I don't know. Yeah. Um but I'll just kind of look forward to that email. I see you whipping around the parking lot. I was like, this is like a Mustang or something. Okay, I'll I'll call you back, Will. Alright, man. Have a good one. Yeah, you too. I'll talk to you soon.

Yeah, no, I guess that's what I'm saying. Well, that's a good thing though, right? Where you feel like you can't help us make good decisions. Is that what you're saying, Corey? I'm just saying like, you know, my decision making affects other people. That's all. I know. Well, mine too. And I feel like I've probably done far more damage than you have. I just, whatever. I'm not going to sit here and talk about it. It's over. I should throw it all away, but I haven't.

Yeah. But I don't know what your finances look like. Right. I don't know. That's a terrible thing to say. Yeah, you should throw it away. Yeah. I wish I could get rid of it. I mean, that's what I was, this is my first thought was, like, I could have you give it to somebody and they can get rid of it and give you money for it, you know? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I remember you said that you were supposed to be getting picked up out of there. Were you like, do you want me to kind of try to get you a ride out of there? I don't know.

But, yeah, I kind of wanted to just hear an update on, like, how things have been going, like, with work with you. And by work, I mean, like, the shirts, you know. Yeah, shirts are actually going smooth as hell. I just came out with a new sweater design and whatnot. My buddies. The only thing on the roadblock that might be potentially coming up in the future is just a place to stay when I turn 18. But I'll be getting a car. You can still hear me. Yeah, I can still hear you. Yeah, I'll be getting a car. A little bit before my birthday from my buddy. And that'll be a starter, which I'm definitely not going to be using that car for a really long time, because, like, the Cadillac and, like, it's already a little bit busted up and whatnot. And, yeah, I want to get, like, an Impala or something. Something that's easier to drive around. You know? Yeah. So things at home have continued to kind of be frustrating for you, yeah? Yeah. I mean, I know. I know it's, like, stuff you don't want to talk about ever. And it's, like, obviously your personal business. I don't know. I don't know. I just want you to know, like, I have heard about it. And, like, you may be kind of used to people coming at you. Is now an okay time for me to be telling you all this? Or should I be, like, you, like, whip around people? Oh, no. I'm hearing my AirPods in. I'm drifting my room. Okay. Yeah, I got my earbuds in, too. Yeah, man. I guess I was saying, like, I know you got that negativity and a lot of kind of feeling like it's unfair. And it is kind of, yeah, a little of this, a little of that. I mean, I see that your strategy is to stay positive and to continue to try to do good things. And that is the right thing. But I want to encourage you to, you know, also, you know, try to ask for help or whatever it is. I don't know if that's the right answer, but I just know that I'm here for you. And I want to see you successful. And I'm not. Yeah, I don't know. I just understand what it's like to be in your position. I'm also the black sheep in my family. If you didn't couldn't tell. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. Yeah. I mean, but the truth of it is, like, I don't know. I'm really I'm really not as bad as as it seems like. I don't know. Sometimes. I don't know. I thought you were cool. So. Yeah, I know. I am cool. So that's fine. I don't know. And I've always like I've always like, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Seth is pretty cool. I'm not saying anything about Seth, but I don't know. I just see you as kind of like the one that, like, they have eyes on. And, you know, not, not always do you know, like, what you're supposed to do to kind of please everyone and kind of just be content at the same time. But I want to encourage this thing with the shirt. Like, honestly, bro. Oh, my God. My kids. It's like, like, it's getting late. And my kids still have all this fucking energy and they're spinning around in the living room. Definitely cute, though. It is cute. Like, it's just I'm waiting for one of them to get hurt. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That won't be cute. I know. And like, I don't I don't I don't mean like, yeah, it's like, I feel like this is a bad thing. But like, you know, some parents, like when your kid gets hurt, you know, some of them are like, oh, baby, are you OK? And like, and yeah, I try to do that. But like, at the same time, for some reason, you got to toughen them up because, you know what I mean? You got to tell them that they're good because they are. I mean, I get I get pissed. Like, I remember I fell down the stairs once when I was a kid. My mom got my mom fucking yelled at me. I was like, I didn't totally understand. But yeah, I don't know. It's like I get scared or something. Yeah, I remember mom used to. Mom would like, yeah. The kids, if we were like messing around and we got hurt that way, mom would just yell at us and stuff. Which is kind of, you know what I mean? Cause and effect. Yeah. So I was going to ask you, like, so what is your what is your process so far? And like, what have you accomplished? Like, what have you learned that you're good at? And this whole, you know, clothing thing so far? Making clothes. I don't know. I really don't know. Like break it down. Like, so I mean, have you you've gotten good with, like, the printer? Like, you know, like, what kind of. Yeah, the printers. The printer is real easy. The printer is real easy. I've gotten good with, like, pressing the vinyl on there and making it clean. But it's all kind of just very easy. And I've gotten. I don't know. It's just a little bit of a process. Cutting out the vinyl, then weeding it. It's just kind of time consuming more than art or not, you know. But. I am kind of like. I am kind of curious what you mean by that. Marketing and stuff. So, like, it's just it just takes a lot of time. I don't know. So, like, are you are you, like, cutting these vinyl things out by hand or like, are you designing them like. No, no. I design it. Then the cricket machine prints it and whatnot. And then or it cuts it. And then I just weed it out because it's like a cut and there's still that negative part that's on the. OK. Dude, I know what you're talking about. Nobody told me this right away, but there's trance. It's called transfer paper. It's basically like. And actually, you can even use a painter's tape. Painter's tape works, too. But it's like because, like, I fucking I didn't really understand it either because nobody told me. I didn't have the patience to watch those videos. But like when. So when the printer gets done printing. You know, you print. And actually, I think you can put the transfer paper on there before. I remember. Right. But anyways. So once it's done printing, like you peel the transfer paper off and it peels that negative side off all at once. So you don't have to, like, you know, fucking get all the little by hand, you know, because it was doing that. It's like. I'm going to go see. That's been something you've been struggling with. It's like, oh, shit, this sucks. Yeah, that takes a lot of time. Yeah. Yeah. It takes a lot of time. Yeah, man. So that's once I knew that because I first designed it. You have to. But I mean, I mean, transfer paper. Don't you have to have like. Don't you have to. Get the ink in the machine for it, because it's like a. It's like paint that they put on, except, you know what I'm saying? It's like screen printing. So no. So this is my understanding of like how when you have a multicolored design and this is the kind of the. Is it so like. I have a vendor that I'm going to be going through. It's just these. I like whenever I make my prototypes or whatnot. That's not going to go to the vendor. The only reason why I just haven't gone to the vendors because they're. In. Cloud and. Also. You got to. I also. Have to like when I have to go there and two. I'm waiting till I can get my dad's tax number or. I might just get the owner of which doctor. The money for the shirts. They could get wholesale, but if I get my dad's tax number. And I could just get wholesale myself. Do it here. I'll get it. I can register your business and your EIN number is free. I don't know what the cost money is registering. It costs a hundred dollars to register. So by. I whip up like a hundred dollars. Yeah. Yeah. A hundred bucks and I can have you fully registered and. And have your EIN. And. 25 Minutes. That'd be golden because I looked. In 25 minutes. Yeah. Yes. I looked. I looked. To see the pricing and all that stuff. And like. It said like 200 to get registered and it could take one business day. If I pay extra. And then there was like all this other add on stuff. I know. Yeah, that's because. That's because of the skill that I learned. Yeah. I don't know. Also. And I'll show you how to do it. I mean, if you're interested. But I'll tell you like the first. First, like. Third, first, three or four times. I even had a business ID. A business license. I didn't know how to do it. I had somebody else set it up for me. But then I eventually. I got out of it. For a little while. And I got back in. I wanted to. Just set it up myself. And it took me. I was on that fucking computer website. For probably 10 hours straight. Before I fucking finally figured it out. 10 hours straight. She. Yeah. I was determined. It's about how long I'd take. Yeah. You know anything about like. Websites and whatnot. Like. Absolutely do. Absolutely. I can do that. Actually. Yeah. Cause I've been leading the website. What? Yeah, dude. I can do all that shit. I can. I mean, here's the one thing that I'm not that great at. Is I'm not that great at marketing. Like I understand how to do it. I'm dude. I'm golden on marketing. Marketing. I'm golden on marketing in person. And online. I just need. I just need. I just need.

And then. Hey. Hey. I'm gonna. After I sell out this package. Huh? You. You. You don't have your phone in your hands. Right? Like. No. Is it like. Sat somewhere. Can you like. Sit it somewhere. Where you can like. See it. But like. You don't have to like. Cause I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Fucking. Snapchat you. And I'm gonna. Share my screen. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You can do that. Oh, yeah.

I'm pretty over this whole situation. The guy has not called. Not nothing. He's texting, like he can answer my texts, but he won't answer my phone calls. So it's safe to assume that he jacked me? Well... Right? Right? It's safe. I don't know, you're...

No. He's just been giving me the runaround, and bullshit. And now I'm going to have to pay somebody to fucking go fuck them on. And I feel bad about that, but... Dude. Have you? Yeah.

No. He won't answer my phone calls since then. Since... He was supposed to come back with it. He has not answered my phone calls.

I don't know if that means anything to you. Yeah. I don't... No, it means nothing to me, because at the end of the day, I've gotten to run around this whole time.

Although the things he said made sense and they lined up. Yeah. What you're saying is something probably didn't work out. So the money that he was going to go do something else with would probably flip it instead of giving it back to you. Yeah. Yeah. But who knows how that's going because he's keeping us in the dark about it. I mean, because that's like exactly what his fucking maneuver. What did he say? Only tell people what they need to know? I'm like, no. I don't think that's a good way to go. I think that when you run a business it's about being transparent and respectful with your coworkers and your employers. Yeah. Somebody told me yesterday. So I'm planning on getting the money back and it's the 10th. So I got to pick up dude at the airport and I'll have everything ready tonight. Sorry it took longer than expected to happen, but I do apologize. I was stressed out yesterday. But I mean, what what I say and what the guy steal your money.

You see him on the phone? I can't hear you. Not you. What? The remote's over there. Hold on a second. He says he's in Iowa right now. Yeah, and he said he can't answer like how can you text message, but you can't answer. If he's in Iowa and doing business with Ivan then talk to Ivan and confirm the details of his story and communicate with him because Ivan I fucking trust. I have like a fucking I trust that guy with obviously probably my life because I don't know my life. It's hard to trust somebody over the phone with your life, but obviously I risked a lot in the past for him and he's the man of your business. Yeah, it is. I mean, I don't like saying his name, but you know. I know I didn't. I don't know. I just said that out loud. It's fine. It's not. It's not. It's not like something. I was going to I was going to message. I was going to message him, but I just wanted to make sure I had the right person. Do it on WhatsApp. I'll give you his phone number on WhatsApp. Yeah, yeah. I'm going I got it now. I'm just going to do it on our group chat. He'll prefer I'll just give you the number because that way you can speak freely and he's not going to trip out because he's not going to tell you everything. He's not going to speak freely unless you're on WhatsApp. That's like a fucking stupid thing. Okay. All right. Here's his number and a text message, but you just got to go into the app. I personally think it's a huge pain in the ass, but I had to have some Middle Eastern dude come and like take my phone out of my hand and punch it in and because I don't know and he explained it to me. I'm just like, honestly, I feel like you got to be foreign in order to understand WhatsApp, but you got the number. Yeah. Thank you. You want me to hang out on the phone until you get it in there right or something? I don't know. Hold on. I got to figure out how to copy. I got it. I got it. You got your people there like all pissed off at you and shit. Stop at me. You got people like was that money yours or was that somebody else? Yeah. No, the money was mine, but I do have friends that are very upset if they if I don't you know what I mean? Because it's just a fucking it's a principle and I am going to have to pay somebody to fucking fuck them up. Like there's no reason this whole time this whole time you can't message me. You can't call me. You can't tell me what's up when you know how like fucking nervous and how like who just gives someone a thousand dollars? They don't even know nobody. So I'm a fucking idiot. So I mean, it's probably best that I do get robbed. I mean, I'm obviously not trying to make this worse for you or anything like that. I mean, I spent like the whole first couple of days and up until last night like ready to go do whatever I needed to do to get that guy's attention. I told you to go over there. I did. I was and I pretty much did. I was like yeah, but then I when those phone calls and our our conversations happen, like it kind of became apparent that you guys were talking with each other and you guys wanted me to work. He said between us that was like a clue for me to like I didn't even look at the messages. I just sent them right over to you. Yeah. And I appreciate you for being transparent with me. I mean, I know that I just feel like he is rather convincing guy. And when the way he talks and he's not bullshit. Yeah. I mean, I know I know him telling me to fucking not talk to my fucking good friend. Like that's fucking extremely backwards like I mean, he's like he doesn't want his business fucked up. Yeah, which is like basically what is what that's what Ivan doesn't want. It's them fucking like doing all this shit on the side and taking people off I mean if I find out that like he ripped you off aka me off because that's what I told him like me and you are the same. If I tell him that then he's going to be pissed. Actually, I don't really know how he reacts because he's not like anybody's dad and the car show don't have power up here. Yeah, they just don't they just don't have power. It's not like they have fucking like house fulls of people like we do. Right. But we're being like I'd be anyways if you let me know what you want to do obviously I would yeah I haven't fully agreed with everything but I yeah Are you messaging because I feel like that's your best solution at this period that's what the plan is communicate with him and tell him that you've been like really open and kind of hold a fast one on you and because I told you because here's the thing like I when they don't drop off the money. Yeah, they don't drop off the money without giving the fucking stuff. Yeah, there's no exchange of money without without a problem. So there's there's no fucking excuse that he dropped off my money and is waiting this time. Yeah, not a fucking idiot. So I mean if you work it out with him because you want to you ultimately want to do business with with half a time is I mean I would like to but I don't know if now is the best. All right. Yeah, whatever you want to do. I mean but yeah, I mean if you know, you know what it was like for me. I mean I the price I was fucking amazing up until I assume things just change but hold on.

Yeah, I'm um... Well, yeah, I've got, I mean, it's just the adults around right now, but... Okay, I'm just over it. It's not nothing. I'm sorry, hold on, say it one more time. Um... I'm pretty over this whole situation. The guy has not called. Not nothing. He's texting, like he can answer my texts, but he won't answer my phone calls. So it's safe to assume that he jacked me? Well... Right? Right? It's safe. I don't know, you're... I thought so at first, but then it sounded like he would work something out with them, so I just, that's why I kind of stopped paying attention. No. He's just been giving me the runaround, and bullshit. And now I'm going to have to pay somebody to fucking go fuck them on. And I feel bad about that, but... Dude. Have you? Yeah. But according to whatever you talked about with him, you're not supposed to talk to a heifer. Is that what he told you? I mean, because... Right, like I pitched it up for him. That's stupid. Yeah. That's stupid. There's no reason why it's taken this long, and it's not bullsh... It's like... And you've been bullshitting me. Have you even seen him since we talked? No. He won't answer my phone calls since then. Since... He was supposed to come back with it. He has not answered my phone calls. He's messaged me, trying to assure me everything was going down still, and everything was right. I do know that last thing heifer told me was, he says, everybody's back to work on Monday. I don't know if that means anything to you. Yeah. I don't... No, it means nothing to me, because at the end of the day, I've gotten to run around this whole time. And it is so disrespectful to just not call me. I gave you $1,000. The least you could do is call me. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I was pissed. Yeah. But I don't really know him. I'm going to go back and look at my messages. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't really know. I haven't talked to him. I was just assuming that you had worked everything out with him, and you were going to... I was going to call him over the phone for a minute. I mean, I guess it kind of implies that he's just not doing anything or he's blowing you off. But I think you were right when you said it right away. Although the things he said made sense and they lined up. Yeah. What you're saying is something probably didn't work out. So the money that he was going to go do something else with would probably flip it instead of giving it back to you. Yeah. Yeah. But who knows how that's going because he's keeping us in the dark about it. I mean, because that's like exactly what his fucking maneuver. What did he say? Only tell people what they need to know? I'm like, no. I don't think that's a good way to go. I think that when you run a business it's about being transparent and respectful with your coworkers and your employers. Yeah. Somebody told me yesterday. So I'm planning on getting the money back and it's the 10th. So I got to pick up dude at the airport and I'll have everything ready tonight.

I mean, because I can actually I can actually get sit with him on the phone and fucking do that. HRA thing. Hold on. Here's that. Hey, how's it going? It's going on. I'm picking up trying to locate Cassie's EBT card while eliminating the destruction afflicted zone that I recreate and disrupt and recreate your on circle cycle. Where I'm being efficient, I'm taking care of three things in one time simultaneous act of doing one thing. I can tell you're fucking talking weird again. I can feel your brain cell fucking like rumbling. Like it's like like one of those fucking Nintendo 64 controllers. And what's coming out is the reverberation of the undigested fuel that was consumed that is not all my gosh, I gotta take I don't know why your, your voice sounds like a fucking guitar sometimes. Or meals on the chalkboard. So that's a lot of vowels. I don't know what to make out of it. So, so I was gonna say, do you still are you still trying to go to St. Cloud? Like, because I made the determination that I can actually apply for the HRA program like online. Like, I could do it with you right now. Yeah, that's an option. If you want to wait until later, or let me call you back when I'm done doing this. So I You got to quit. You don't got to do anything but think or talk. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I get it. I get it. No, no, no. You're gonna get you're getting a good mental workout. You should keep on doing whatever it is you're doing. Yeah, yeah, I totally feel ya. Okay, um, I'm actually gonna Zeke's gonna take care of getting ahold of her. Because she is kind of pissed me off a little bit for the day. So, okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. All right. So I'll just give you a call later. Okay. That are you back at home tomorrow? Or are you? Yeah, yeah, I'm in more. Yeah. Okay. Well, enjoy your time playing daddy. And anything else can occur when I hear from you or when I let you know that I'm done here. And to move further forward. As of going to St. Cloud, I don't have any opposition against it. Doesn't have to is it? Are they going to be able to do if we were to do that tomorrow or tonight or whatever? Is there going to be the staff to do the paperwork, whatever? Because it's the weekend or is it best to go on Monday where I got court Monday? You got court Monday in Stearns County? No, I had court Monday in, I think in Noka. Yeah, then we can wait until later. I just like initially, I kind of thought that it would be online. But if you do need like, to do one of those, this like the ID, birth certificate, whatever vouchers, if you do need one of those, then I think we got to go to some place out, make an appointment out someplace in St. Cloud, because you can only do the one at the Basilica like once a year. Voucher for the license ID or voucher? Yeah. Which one? Okay. Well, I got the ID stuff. The voucher for housing or hotel housing supplement vouchers for the, the shit you're talking to me about, about going to the Sheriff's Department to get a hotel room for fucking the wintertime or whatever. Oh, yeah. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Okay, go ahead. I've been seeing a lot of posts or links of signing up or requesting it, where I've never seen that opportunity before. But hearing about it from you last year, two years ago, I'm seeing that now being offered. And I don't know if it's like a fucking, get you to surrender all your information and run with it. Or if it actually has a conclusion, because some of the stuff that I've attempted to do, this puts me on another survey or another Q&A type aspect. I'm sorry, you lost me. You lost me. What is this? What? I feel like I missed the first. The homeless hotel voucher form or whatever, was being advertised on Facebook. And I just that what is on Facebook doesn't necessarily mean it's a legitimate thing. And I've never gotten any further into looking into that hotel voucher thing. After trying to stop that the fucking Sheriff's Department with you actually requesting for a voucher for a hotel room by having you tell me the story. And I reiterate that to the officer as if it was my story. And how I'm curious, as I'm looking into that for myself, after talking to my buddy who just had that done for him out of town last night, walking home from wherever the fuck he was walking home, the story that you told me, or whatever. Yeah, yeah. I told you a story about a person, a friend getting stuck out of town and not having a way. Yeah, I remember. Yeah, that's what I told the sheriff's, I think it was in Anoka County. And they told me that I was received a lot of hot air blowing up my ass. So I hope I enjoyed the story. Where it was a really, really rude, but funny way that the secretary had said it. Yeah, I think I did. We did already determine that Anoka doesn't do it. But, uh, there are still some other counties. I think they're more like suburb ones that may do it. I don't even fucking know. I'm gonna hold on. Hold that thought. I'm gonna fucking ask it. Yeah, somebody somebody. But I don't even want to ask you ask a question. I just got my phone to turn on for me to have two conversations with you back in a very brief moment where I just got to my mom's house. Boom, third, third conversation. Hey, I want you to I can send you a text message that had a screenshot in it and of those tiles. Yep, yep, yep, yep. I was talking about the two tiles or four tiles or whatever. Yeah, yeah, it's the two flat ones and the two fucking regular ones. Send me money so that I can get those things for us and send me money for a fucking phone case for you a phone case and me a phone case and fucking you probably need a new phone pretty soon. That or get the replacement glass for it to save everything on it for working properly. But it needs to be clean since it was next to the pop that exploded. And in that cleaning, you have to do when you replace the glass anyways, that I don't know if I can replace the black black back glass part of it. But the back that back glass doesn't really do much besides feel whatever. That's a digitizer. So that's a digitizer. It goes a digitizer. Yeah, that's the digitizer. And then the screen goes on that digitizer like fucking does the touch. Yeah, the glass on on that backside is chipped away and crack, but you can't see any internal phone components where you can see inside the phone from the actual screen side. Yeah, um, you know, actually, but it's really expensive. I can really think it's really it's like so expensive that it's almost not worth it to purchase a new perk like get it fixed. But if you are able to do the work or find somebody that's able to do the work. Or find somebody that's able to do the work. I Justin Justin. What the fuck I just closed my eyes and now I forgot what I was saying. It's about $50 cheaper to get the glass replaced. If you take it to a repair shop, but at the same time that $50 of it being cheaper of it being fixed versus spending the $50 more to get the same exact phone for the price that we got it for. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. There is there is that fucking option is anyway, do you do you just say put a fucking thing on on the wound or something like that? What? I like to put many things on other people's moons. Nevermind. Look at it. Every time I fucking close my eyes, I close my eyes for a split second and my mind just go my words. Like completely incoherent. That means that you need to rest your brain for a moment and sit there with your eyes closed until something outside auditorily and get some open. I know you're right. You're right. But I'm gonna do that. But I'm gonna do that because I want to do it. Not because you recommended it. Where it's a lot easier to achieve what you're trying to attempt to succeed. If you were to fill the tummy first. Yeah. And also put my like put both my hands in freezing cold water for like 10 seconds while breathing in and out. Yeah. I think that would be the one way to actually open your eyes wider. So I don't know if that will aid or assisting in closing them until they open naturally. It's supposed to be it's supposed to like initiate. It's like a force close. It's like a force close for like your brain where basically restarts it. Anyways, I got some stuff I want to do and I'll talk to you later. Okay. All right. Do you want one of us to call at five or are you staying the whole time? Yeah. No, Zeke's got it covered. He'll make contact with her. Yeah. All right. I'll just talk to you soon. Okay. I'll talk to you either when you wake up or tomorrow. Sounds good. Okay.

What are you saying? Still fits the problem. That it was like going down. Whatever you read it. You read it. He's lying about that. He's lying about he is. Yeah, because I haven't just told me that we don't. We don't take money without giving products. So we don't like. He says we don't. We don't give. We don't take money without giving a product. Word for word. He says. I don't know. He's saying that he didn't even. Give it to them. They wouldn't have done that until they had the products in their hands. Right. So they don't do it like that. Yeah. Because he told me that's how they've been doing it. I think he's pulling a fast one. I don't know. I sense. So. I don't know. I'm confused. I'm a little confused because. Okay. I know that I totally framed this in the beginning so that like, this is like, however you want to run this and operate this. I wasn't going to be like over your shoulder. Yeah. I don't want you to feel like I am right now, because the only reason I'm still. I guess. That's important for me to say, I guess. What was I going to say after that? Such a space case. I don't even have plans to go pick him. Pick up or. He was just lying about the whole thing. No, no. I think it is. You're you're you're right. And I'm right. Like, what are you saying is lining up. I don't know. I don't know. He still shouldn't have taken that money from me. And I feel like the fact that he did. It was just like, like. Now you must've needed it for something else. Yeah. Like what. I'm thinking that's what it is. I mean, it's not like. You didn't have my permission to do anything with. Right. Yeah. Sorry. Super fucking. But. And also. I don't know. What can I. What can I do. Was he going to pay me back. Sounds like this thing. So, sounds like Ivan is saying, like, I don't know. I just told him. I just told her, but I'm like, all right, this is the time to like, explain to me everything. Not like little bits of it. Right. Yeah. I think his next message could be totally wrong, but I think his next message is going to be like, telling me the details about, you know, going out there. And if he doesn't go out there, I'd be welcome to go. It sounds like he's welcoming me to go out there and grab. Are they going to give you a vehicle? No, I don't know. Well, I don't know. They should have that shit figured out, I guess. Maybe they should. I don't know. On TV, on YouTube, they'd like to drive, like, rental cars all the time. But I guess if you get pulled over with a rental car, they're immediately suspicious of you. All right. Well, anyways, yeah, well, I'll feel it out. But I mean, yeah, I guess basically what I've gathered so far is Tom has kind of gone rogue a little bit. I think he took advantage of our conversations and circling around trusting him. And I know that with you, you have total autonomy to, like, talk and say whatever you want to these guys. But I think he kind of may have worded things in a way that, like, he didn't want me to hear him say that to you on purpose. Because if I would have heard that, I would have told him no. Right. I don't know. Well, don't say anything to him that you know. Because I'm going to just play it as whatever and make him meet up with me. Or I can swing it another way and make him think I want to hang out with him. Here's one thing I know Tom is good at. If he wrongs you today and four weeks or six months or three days, like, he'll come through. And like I kind of said earlier, it's kind of hard to be angry at the guy who's got a bunch of dope. But yeah, that's not today, I guess. That's not today? Yeah, I mean, he's not that guy today. So I'm feeling kind of angry at him. I feel like he probably, I mean, like you were saying, like, he probably, like, took money. And I don't know if he spent a bunch of it on gas to get out there. I really don't know. We can only speculate. But it wouldn't make sense if, like, in a, I don't know, I'm just using my intuition. But then again, it's just fucking irritating, you know. I don't know if I can get that money back. Yeah, I'm saying, like, yeah, all right. Sorry, I'm going to let you go. Yeah, yeah, I'll get the money back.

And I'm pretty certain that I know who is. Well I don't know who owns it but I knew somebody that stayed there and it was like Phoenix's ex boyfriend. And if it is, and if it was I don't know if that guy is still associated with it and I don't really fucking want much to go there. But I don't know. He said some Michelle lives there, Michelle. I don't know who that is. Yeah, he said that's the only person that lives there is a Michelle. Really, that's, that's Phoenix's real name. Okay, yeah.

All right, well, give me a call and you want to. I'll fucking see what I'll tell you what happens out here. I know that I have to be out of town, and by a certain time. So I'm hoping to get. I don't even know where I put his card. If I have curse, but I didn't see it in there. I don't know, I'm gonna get high, though, you could have left for a little bit and just came back when I woke up. You would have probably distracted me anyway. Say it again. I said you probably would have just distracted me. What work. No, I'm getting ready to work. Ready for. Oh yeah, that's what I do do I. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if I can hang out with you unless we're fucking smashing I guess, I guess I'm just a fucking boy. Because I just go crazy insane. When we don't fucking bang. So, and I bug you.

I really do. Bring it with you to work, I guess, I don't know. Damn it I do need to go back and get that. I don't know he's gonna be like pest. He's not gonna be pissed he's gonna be like probably a little excited because someone implies that he gets to go back over your house. Yeah, yeah I mean I would if I were you. I'll try to find it here. What are you saying, if I were you, you would try and find it there. There. You want me to look for it is actually. No, no, I said I'll look for it I said if I were you I'd come back here. All right. All right, if you find it, let me know. And I'll come back. Okay. Okay. All right. All right.

And both of them accept dogs. Yeah, there's like two of them. One of them is rather ghetto. I mean, they're both like a little ghetto, but one is like superΓÇö They're all going to be ghetto in some way, fashion, shape, form between the setting or the clientele or the staff, where everything will fall in line accordingly from that perspective. But I'll wait to talk to you in person on some questions I got, too. But, yeah, being in the St. Cloud area, I'm not too surprised. There's going to be a lot of youth and young adults, I would imagine. Youth and young adults, I imagine? Yeah, like 18, 19, 20. No, like 18, 19, 20, like college age.

Yeah, standard fucking VTA, you know, homeless person. NPCs seem to be accumulating a lot more in bulk. Yeah, I know. So the good thing about this other place, the place that I'm recommending is hopefully this place where my organizations actually can eventually partner with them because of me meeting with their program coordinator and all that shit. But one of the fucking amenities about that place is if you come in, everybody's welcome, and dogs are, too. And typically, once you register, do all their process, they give you a mat. And you're in the mat and in the hallway or in the lunchroom until your paperwork is done processing, which is usually a day or two. But if you come in and you're in treatment or you're affiliated with some sort of recovery, then you skip the floor mat in the hallway, and they put you in a room right away. Kind of hot-tracked or fast-tracked in there. Yeah. Yeah. And also, I remember, and I actually, I confirmed, like, you guys take dogs, right? Like, big dogs, whatever, and they're like, yes, but every dog needs to come in with a cage. Okay, I got a cage available. Okay. Okay. Yeah, man, I think it'd be a really good idea. So, I mean, I have talked to my supervisor about you, like, I don't know, I talked to him probably, like, twice. And one of those times, like, I think it was actually, like, the day after I got a call to you. And I was like, yeah, man, has anybody reached out to him? Like, he's just been sleeping, and he's a little bit off the map, and God knows what. And he's like, yeah. Well, I had a chance to, like, kind of explain to him some of the, like, thumb. I mean, I don't think I need a fucking, like, four hours at least to go over all the bullshit you got going on, but. Yeah, I don't know. But somebody, like, your mental health goals, the thing with your Rule 20, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, whoever you assign them to, like, it needs to be, like, really good. And I guess, like, the guy that they did assign you to was, like, lost his license for, like, a week or something. Because he didn't do something he was supposed to. But there is supposed to be somebody reaching out to you. Has anybody? You heard from anybody? Yep. Yep. Saturday, I think he said he's going to message me to remind me. And then we're going to plan something for, like, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, somewhere around there. Cool, cool. Yeah, actually. So I haven't mentioned anything about you going to St. Cloud for the weekend or whatever. I haven't mentioned it to anybody, like my supervisor or your primary yet. And I don't think I'd get in trouble for that sort of thing. In fact, I don't even think I would have to tell them that you were in St. Cloud or that I brought you to St. Cloud. Just leave that part out, maybe. I don't know. Okay. I don't know. It's whatever. I could speak about anything openly as possible with in mind of anything that's requested to be redacted. It's very easily done for me. We're speaking subjectlessly on a subjective subject. It's fucking like a God-given gift. Yep, whatever you just said, I believe it.

Good. Was your boss in a good mood today? Yeah, he was. Yeah, it started out really good that uh yeah, I just like hate making mistakes and it's so easy to make mistakes in this in this job because there's a lot going into it and so every time I do make a mistake, I beat myself up a little bit. I think today I only probably made one mistake. I don't even know if I made the mistake. Yeah. No, it was yesterday. I did. I didn't. I don't think I made any mistakes today. So, can you tell me a little bit more detail about like like I know you like when you tell me when you told me like the first time, I'm only only really able to like keep keywords. I'm sorry. You're working like a yeah. I don't know. Maybe you you try it. I get it. Well, I celebrate parts. I don't sell. I don't do the selling. I do the distribution. Um I send it out in uh one of our couple of couriers we go through. So, DoorDash and priority and stuff. So, I get to delegate whether or not which service to use, how heavy it is, what um you know, I gotta put in all the the packages. I gotta count them. I gotta check the parts, make sure there's the right parts and then um and then I send them out and then I have to know the city which I you know, I only know Northeast and Columbia Heights and that side of the city, the north side of the city. I don't know I don't know anything south and so that's my downfall is so delegating where and what these where these people are going to go is really hard for me. I don't necessarily have to do most of the delegating because I just I put in the orders but I have to know, I have to put them in strategically. So, the people that do pick it will pick the right ones. So, I'll put in all the south ones at one time so that they'll give all that to one person. Otherwise, if their parts aren't delivered in within like 2 hours, they're calling and freaking out on you. Oh, yeah and so that's a little irritating but and then I work with a bunch of guys who are just most, I don't know. I like most of them but some of them are mean but I don't take no **** No **** taking Becky. So, mean define mean like I'm kind of interested to hear about this like it's because like they're they're they are they're married and they have like wives and they're like, yeah, they're like, I'm married. Yeah, they're like, oh, I'm like, what? You don't want to hit on You don't want to hit on me? Oh, **** It's stupid ice here. I can't even remember who who I am. I might lose you because I'm going down in my basement. Um but I'll call you. I'll call you right back once I get upstairs or upstairs. So, it should be like 2 seconds but you can go on. Go on.

I was with but uh I've seen some like somebody that it's like, oh yeah, I think I remember it was some **** older old lady chick. Actually, I couldn't really tell if she was like an old lady or she's kind of like, I don't know what's going on because but she looked like an older older lady like kind of like **** Asian or something. I don't even know blonde hair and then like her age. We were, we were at the bar. The guy next to her was like **** six. Clearly, clearly like 60 years old.

how and what I did when I got sober was I researched the topic of aliens and or energy and or like you know like what life is I guess if that makes sense so I feel like I've always been open to that I I've seen anomalous stuff in the sky since a teenager I actually have videos of like orbs outside of my house like like three different three minute minute long uh films on my iphone of this like ball of light that was like going in circles and changing colors and moving all around the sky but like still like staying in a relative area it was really cool bro and I bet that bet that was recently too wasn't it yeah yeah yeah it was like a year ago or so oh my god oh my god I just broke something dude I just saw I just saw an orb for the first time like that night that I was working on that car uh the night I was with Zach yeah that was my first ufo crazy like about a month and a half ago I saw like three of them in like a 10 minute period dude yeah um yeah you got this uh I don't know if I know I try not to talk about it really too much I say that and I say that every time I bring it up but I try I try not to talk about it too much because I really don't want to fucking sound like a crazy person at all like that's not appealing to me but there is uh this documentary that's that uh just came out within the last month called age of disclosure and um it's supposed to be like really good and uh and uh and then like and then within the week or like three weeks of that being uh like released uh Steve Spielberg releases this this preview for this movie that he's coming out with now and uh it's called the movie that movie's called uh day of disclosure yeah have you seen that preview yet no I I've heard of it but I mean I I pretty much am aware that any and every sci-fi movie over the last 50 years has been disclosure in the form of soft disclosure um both like approved by actual government channels as well as like you know people that are just in the know I know that they hold disclosure over our heads like a dangling carrot um while secretly still like lying to our face and subverting money and their intentions um I know that NASA is fake I know that the whole world is bigger than what they say it is there's a big old ice wall yeah you know yeah outer space may actually have a firm a minute even though I'm not religious I do like I've seen a lot of different crazy things about that I also believe that like the world is both us here and it's flat and it's one of those things that you know it's what whatever your paradigm is right so it's like what you're only bound by the constraints in your head and and your perception you know like how they've done that slit experiment where it it'll go through either the right or the left slit depending on who's looking at it have you ever heard of that yeah yeah I think that I didn't I didn't hear the last part thing that you said you like it as a matter and really loud you're kind of breaking up um yeah I said I couldn't I couldn't really hear the last like few words you said because my kid was saying that like yeah that everything is like what you believe it to be true and that kind of goes back to like how we create our own world and I was referencing this experiment is called the split experiment or maybe it's called the experiment or maybe it's called the double slit experiment and it basically that is that the results of the science physical experiment change on whether or not somebody is watching it or not that's so that's kind of hard for me to wrap my mind around yeah I mean I would just I would probably just do it and then you'll find out way more information than I could tell you but I mean I also know that like the words that we say and the thoughts that we have carry energy and that those are the you know things like whatever we tell we whatever we tell ourself is true is true you know and the world will align to that but we have to stay focused you know so like positive self-talk is huge um and that's one thing that like I try to like point out to my clients and then you know like encourage change on right because like there's themes that are running in our head and we always are going to choose like you know to believe whatever we tell ourselves so why not tell ourselves positive things you know and sometimes that takes like challenging years of learned behavior and um you know experiences that reinforce negativity but you know like the messages that were told at home you know like you're not good enough you're not smart enough or maybe you are good enough and maybe you are smart enough you know um but generally when we have clients they have issues that are you know deep-seated all the way back to our childhood you know yeah yeah yeah no that's absolutely right yeah yeah I got your yeah I got your text I got your text about the um the admin hours and yes yeah if you're if you're over going to be over for the four hours and yeah please submit that okay okay I'll do that okay I will I will um yeah I think I'll oh yeah and all right then I also like um there's a this thing maybe this is more of an azac thing but I was gonna talk to him sometime today but I I like I don't know I was too busy on the computer and kind of focused but uh there's there's like this uh document that I kind of put together about the driver's licenses and I don't know just some resources and and we're kind of kind of went into like um I don't know I told Heidi about it too and kind of piggybacks on a conversation we started a month ago about everybody consolidating our resources and having them available um but I don't know I I sent it I'm supposed to get her information later but I just sent you over what I have already and okay because you wanted to like have it uploaded in the app and again maybe that's an azac thing or a whole thing but it is kind of cool yeah okay well um I would definitely recommend talking to him about that in particular um some of that admin stuff I'm not exactly sure about how to even do or whatever if that makes sense but um in general I think that um he would probably want to you know talk to you or hear from you or see how you're doing um and has definitely like asked me regularly about you know updates you and the progress you're making and you know effort or initiative that you've been putting in and um all that so damn so yeah he's been damn all right all right I'll call him right now actually I mean it well I mean to be fair it's been like that about everybody I mean because right now who does not in the office so I have to update him um and or he's like the one that is being hands-on with um pretty much everything right now so yeah yeah okay so last question I swear okay if um so when uh one of our clients go does a assessment at Kaishen and obviously there's that ROI that between us and that organization they send us over that uh CD assessment and it would make sense that that CD assessment is in percent of somewhere that for that I could access it is that correct that once it's uploaded you would have access to that yes like it's just within their file you would it'll like pop up like you know how to click on their number and then it'll pop out their whole uh no service lines the Danes at the bottom etc yeah yeah and it'll say it on there once it's entered there will be a line under full clinical target and it'll be labeled you know ROI-Kaishen okay because we have to have that in there and on file to receive that assessment so it has to be there once it's there it'll be there that makes sense okay all right okay so let's see because I see yeah Cassie hit me up and she was like asking me questions about like rule 25 assessments and this and and asked me like 10 questions and I was like okay I think you can do this and after actually giving her a bunch of answers I kind of clicked with me I was like wait a second we don't need to contact Kaishen to do anything if you don't need it updated so it's under uh let's see medical or something or is it under hold on a second um I'm about to pull up pull that up so I can tell you I need to look at somebody else's too now that I'm thinking about it um yeah so you click on their client number once it's highlighted and then that'll pop out a white a white screen that has appointments service lines clinical charting recent billings and recent payments and then authorizations so it would be in that third section the clinical charting okay I see a comprehensive assessment yeah and that's the same as a CED assessment correct I mean of course yeah yeah okay so then okay now I'm looking at it okay um oh wow this looks like something do they do do they do percent of as well like this looks like something I could change like if if I was really stupid I would change something on accident well why would you do that that's not what I'm trying to do but it looks like I could is that right I mean I don't want to change anything of course because that would be illegal but like how do I so I don't know I was just kind of surprised I didn't I expected to see like a photocopy version of it or something actually if you're actually in there can you can I can you just do this so I don't mess this up because I'm nervous already well hold on why are you even opening this up to look at it she needs a copy of it um sent to her public defender and she said to just email it to her um I don't know how to do that and I just pulled up to my client so I'm gonna have to get back to you I didn't realize that was where you were going with all this oh yeah I'm still sorry yeah it's okay I'll have to call you back okay all right that's cool all right I'll talk to you

What's up? Hey, how's it going? Oh, just doing a wellness plan. Oh, oh man, well, I'm kind of what, you know, that's why I texted you first. I didn't want to call you if you're with somebody. No, you're right. What's up? Um, well, there's, well, there's a couple things. Um, and the first was, um, you know, I obviously know that I'm not supposed to bill for somebody for more than four hours one day. So if so if I actually do end up spending more time with that person in four hours, then I just like cut it off at four hours or is there like a solution to like that? Um, I would definitely call Miles on that. I cut it off at four hours just because like one time I wouldn't let me clock out. We were at an event and it wouldn't let me clock out and it went to like four or one. So I just adjusted my time to four. Um, but yeah, just definitely talk to Miles about that. Okay, I can do that. And then, um, the next thing, um, I was seeing Colette Berg in the beginning of this week. Um, and, um, I don't know if you had a chance to read my notes. Man, you better quit punching him, dude. All right. Um, um, yeah, right. Yeah. I don't know if you had a chance to read my notes, but, um, uh, but I was able to talk her basically into starting treatment and she should be getting picked up today. I don't, I don't read notes anymore. Oh, you don't? Nope. That's Miles. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Um, and then let's see. Oh yeah. And then there's two more things. Um, I, I remember a while ago we were talking about the list of resources and whatever, kind of compiling them or just sharing them with each other somehow. Um, do you ever like have a document or anything like, what are you, like a way of putting that together? Cause I was either going to send you what I have or ask you to send what you have to me. Um, pretty much. I just still have all of my stuff just in my head or on my phone. Um, I have, I have one list that's hanging in my office for different like silver houses and stuff. Um, but nothing like, like a template. I guess what would be easier? And if, do you think, do you think it'd be like good for you to like, maybe like photocopy that thing that's on your, in your office and then like maybe just text what you have in your head or like, or actually then I'll send you what I know about the silver houses and you can kind of just tell me your name. Or we can sit down sometime next week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like that solution. Hi, we're closed today. You are? Yep. Yep. Is there something I can like get to drink or snack on? Um, let's see what we can grab. Um, are you still with me? Yeah, I'm here. You work too hard. Um, you can come back here really quick. Um, all right. Um, for like to go. All right. But yeah, that's what I would do. Pablo's other questions are pretty much miles questions or the last thing. Um, I, uh, earlier, earlier this week there was like that confrontation with Anthony and, and, um, whatever. And you discussed with me, um, uh, you know, not sharing, you know, information or saying things like that in front of people. And it was all, and when I'm, I met with Dagan, I very briefly, like earlier this week, and I am trying to get him to do his, uh, his CD assessments. Um, but, uh, he had mentioned, um, uh, you were good friends with his baby mama. He was like, I, I don't know, I guess he said that he doesn't get along with her and he was concerned that you guys would be like sharing information. And no, I won't share any information about Dagan to her. I thought they were friends though. I mean, I, I was kind of what I thought. I mean, me and my, like, you know, my, my recovery mind, like everything, I always think of everything in like a light optimistic sense. So like when I heard that you guys know each other, sorry, I'm listening. Yeah. Well, yeah. When I heard that you knew his girlfriend or baby mama or something like that, I was like, Oh, okay. That means it's a good thing. So, you know, if there are issues like, you know, them coming around this office means, you know, positive energy. Right. No, I won't say anything about Dagan. I won't even, like I said, I don't read your notes or anything like that. I, um, so I wouldn't even know anything. And I, I am, I wouldn't be, uh, working with him. You know what I mean? Yeah. So no worries there. Okay. Okay. Um, all right. Well, are you, how's your day going? Good. Good. But I need to get back to this. So all those other questions, just, um, ask miles. Copy. All right.

I mean, we open at nine, but... Right. Okay. All right. I guess to reframe my question, I was like, if somebody were to show up at like 11.10, would they still be able to get helped? I'm not sure. I'm not sure about that one. Uh-huh. I'm sorry. Go ahead. You want to get here as early as possible. Don't wait to the last minute. Is it pretty busy there on those days? Yeah, exactly. Wow. Okay.

Well, I'm sure it does cost a lot. And there is a lot of risk. But I don't know if we make some money. So, uh, where to have a beer. I'll see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm in the city. No, no. I just read your. I just read your message. Oh, no. I don't really ask him when it comes to all these numbers, everything that he said that he's going to say. And when he just tells me, like, I've been, I've always had to pay 12. Up until six months ago. Now he's saying 13, which I thought was bullshit, but I get it, whatever, but there's no way I'm going to go from 13 to 25. Like, okay, maybe next year, you know, next season, I'll fucking work with you when you get to control your business. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. Soda. So weird. So weird. I'll like if our sentences, like I'll put like Minnesota in the, in like the middle, but it ends up on the end of a sentence when you're saying it in Spanish. I never understood how that works. Yeah. You should've, you should've heard my buddy Zach last night. We're about to go jump in this hot tub. And there was like this, I don't know what he was saying some super. It was fucking funny. It was funny, but it was also like really rapey that the way he said it to this person. Yeah. I just want to be like, I got five. Sold tonight. And that's not even me trying. That's just people coming to me. It's my Facebook picture on there. When I. Is your Facebook. Yeah. You can see. What are you here? What are you asking? I was just wondering if I have a picture on mine. Yeah. Yeah. Like it looks like a profile picture. Okay. Okay. I would never pay that. Yeah, that's fucking absolutely ridiculous. Yeah. And he said that price was for you, Brandon. Yeah. And that's one of the messages. Is that, yeah. And that's what I was trying to do. To display was that's like. I'm not giving. Yeah, that is my price. So like, that's why I'm giving her. Like you, you know, Think of her. That's my price. That's my price. And she's part of me. I'm just kidding. That's that's helping me out too. And be like, I told her a certain price or something. I don't know. I will say that. Or if I can just at least get these first five for that. Okay. Do any more business. Okay. What's up, bro. You want to change it to a different one? Which one is one. Tell me. You want to pick one? That's so weird. Okay. Okay. I'll take that same price. Same place because then I support. Work together. I should just say work together. Pretty much. I don't know. I don't really know how you want to work. Okay. Oh, I wanted to convey. So this is what the whole message said. No, she's got five sold tonight. And that's not even trying hard, but if we can't do the price, we've been doing that. That price that we've been doing. We'd be willing to do more travel out of state to help you. Okay. Yeah. He was telling me about some shit. Not too long ago. Like there's like a. Like if I'd be willing to like do this. Okay. But he never really told me any of the logistics of it, just that I'd be going to pick it up in Kansas city. I would like her to get that same price because she and I work together. And. Yeah. All right. Okay. Forgot to translate it. Yeah. And he's got an iPhone too. He's all about the iPhone. So. I'm so tired. I was like falling asleep. Driving. I'm away at home. Yeah. I mean, I know that. So. Yeah. No fucking way. If it's that, I wouldn't. I would feel stupid even fucking bring it up to anybody like that. Right. Okay. I don't know. You must have. So take a fucking. Oh, no. That's crazy. Yeah. I was expecting that. Right. Yeah, I'm doing. Damn. 15. Yep. You want to see if you want to, if you want to throw that number in there. By all means. You could. Never probably be a good time to say it because I'm about ready to like. I'm sorry for your losses. Yeah. I wish your business very profitable. If you need any help, let me know in the future. I'm sorry, buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Like that. Like that. Yeah. Okay. Around, I don't know. Okay. To. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. This is what I got. All right. Would you be willing to offer that price one last time? He's got a lot of workers that are ready to go. It's not all about it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You still work same time tomorrow. Oh, yeah. I'm not sure I might be. I might be hitching a ride off with Zach. Or I might be driving out there. I'm not sure, but. Zach's card. I think. Might be grabbing some. More. Yeah. White girl. I'm not sure. You listen to me. You can call me back if you want. I don't even hear you. Yeah. What. I don't know. I said a few things, but. I can just call you back a little bit or tomorrow or something. Yeah. I mean, a few messages back, like stay in the chat. Yeah. Yeah. I'll look to answer like one or two more times. You, you. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. You don't got plans in the evening, right? Not that I can think of. Yeah. Right. You're not helping this situation. Oh, I didn't even see that. Tell me a message. Yeah. Yeah. You think. Right. Tom says, Brandon, you're not helping this situation. He is saying no to any kind of sale price. Let me do this, bro. Let me do this, bro. I got her and I like Becky and she will be treated. Right. Well. I don't know. Let's say that. Right. He said it again. He says. Brandon, you're not helping this situation. He is saying no to any. Like, let me do this, bro. Like, let me do this, bro. I got her and I like Becky and she will be treated. Right. I assure you. Oh, that's nice. That was not nice. That's scary. I don't trust anybody with my Becky. Oh, you do. You kind of settle down. I need these tonight. I really need them. Yeah. But I don't need them for 2500. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe he'll be able to give them to price. I don't know what he's paying, but. And he's prefer. But maybe keep it at that. Don't go nuts. I'm not a feeder. People. I can only, I can't really understand what you said, but yeah, I mean, I'll take your guys's advice. I could be fucking making things kind of worse. Yeah. You're taking a personal. Yeah. I think it is a business aspect. If I can get it. If I can get it at 15. I'd probably sell it for two. I leave me. Like five. It's more than enough. I only make a couple of hundred off each. I was. It's not even worth it. Well, yeah, no. And there's no way. There's no, I mean, For 2500. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For 2500. Yeah. Okay. We get more. All right, I'll let you go. Yeah. Okay. Whatever. Hey, that's the most they can pay. What do you mean? Oh, I think he meant to what's the most they can pay. That's not, but it's not, that's not the game you want to be in. Honestly, like none of these transactions are become worth it. Unless like you were making like a substantial amount of money. I mean, if you're making only like hundreds of dollars off of like, I don't know, a few trends, I don't know. I don't know. I guess I got a word. My words, right. Correctly, but like it is a huge risk. I mean, but the price that that price is like the right price because of how it works out on the math. But that's, that's crazy. Like the number to go from that to that. That's like, oh, okay. So I guess I got a fucking snow. If I'm going to be make profit, I got to buy 10 pounds at a time now. Yeah. He's this. Dude, he's telling, this is what I'm just saying. He's saying that he's never sold you for that cheap. No, he's saying that's what he's saying. That's what I've been telling saying. Yeah. Yeah. I know. That's what he's telling Tom. Yeah. That's, that's the same price. I've always gotten it for him. In fact, I've even like, he's even got given it to me. He says, if you can. Well, at one point I was like, cause he really wanted to get me put on. I was like, I'm having a hard time coming up with fucking money right away. And he's like, I'll tell you what, if you give me 900. Like you can give me the rest. Like when you like get it up, some of it sold. And I really super appreciate that. Yeah. You better just stop messaging cause you're making it there. He's saying like pretty much saying you're making it worse. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not messaging Ivan anymore. Yeah. Why is he. I don't know. Don't take it out. Don't don't. Thanks so much. I feel like maybe. I don't know. What the hell is going on? Because I know that I sent, I said this. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just having a conversation with. With. Prior to all this. Cause naturally I feel like maybe right now he's like. Panicking or something like that. I don't know. Maybe I put him on a weird spot. I don't know. I fucking knew it was weird when Tom said like, he's like, whoa. Like that's I've never paid. Price. I don't know. It's crazy. Communicating a bit. If you're willing to, we can talk about it again later. Shut up. He's keeps on saying that bro. Yeah. Stop. Let him, let him have me. Cause I need it. I need this. I already told them. And if he's going to give it to me for that price. Okay. I don't know what that means. Like, I mean, that's okay. I mean, if he's like, he's got me. Like he's saying, he's saying he's, he's got me taken care of. That's like, he's, he's got this stuff for me. That's what I hope he means. That's all he's saying. Yeah. That's exactly what he means. He doesn't mean anything more than that. He's got me taken care of. He's not saying that. I understand. I understand. I understand. I get it. I get it. I get it. But that doesn't mean I'm not. I mean, has he told you what he's doing yet? Or I mean, cause as far as I know, he's a thousand dollars from where he hasn't given you anything. He already grabbed it and he's already on his way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Don't text anymore. I'm not. I'm the only person. I'm trying to say. Okay. Sorry. Yeah. Just say thank you, bro. It means a lot. I haven't looked at a last message in there. And I didn't. Well, just tell him. Tell them thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah. I already said I was going to say that. Oh. I haven't said anything. Oh, okay. I didn't hear you. What's up, buddy? Yeah. Yeah. Well, I hope that that expression is like, I hope that he's going to set, that means like he's going to actually do something close to what we were hoping for and that would be good. But I just, on the other hand, I hope that I don't have to fucking like, like hunt fucking Tom down and like bleed him tonight for fucking doing some weird hanky shit with you. You know what I'm saying? I have not. I know. I know. He's not. I don't think. I'm not saying that. No. I'm very. Yeah. Something. Yeah. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? But. Why? You think he's like that? No, no, no. Oh, yeah. Um, I've noticed that ever since he went back, he's gotten really much went back and well, I think, uh, I think I may have just put him on a spot. I'm going to say you're a little tired right now and I was going to go to bed. I'm going to go to bed. All right. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. I'm. I'll let you get to sleep. I know you're tired. No, I'm okay. I am trying to get off the phone. All right. Bye. Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.

Hi. I'm sitting here texting like a fucking schoolgirl twirling my hair. How's it going? I'm like. Cute. I like that. Yeah. I like that. I know. I'm like trying to text and then I was on the other line with Thomas and then he messaged Thomas while we're messaging here now and asked him if he knew me. And Thomas said he was cool with giving me five. He doesn't mind, but also he doesn't, you know what I mean? It's like, he's like, well, your price or what? What price? You know? So I don't want him to lose out on any, but also I don't, I'm not the one with the money right away. Honestly. I have the money. I just like getting it. I have it right away as soon as I, but I have to have the stuff. Yeah. I don't know what to say to him either. I don't know what to say to him either. I feel like a little school girl. Right. Right. I don't know what I'm thinking. I'm just kind of. Yeah. But he did tell the other guy that you don't like text good enough or text back fast enough. So you got to be hard on top of that. What's up has been some questions questions. Also, we're working so hard. I'm sorry. Don't don't let me talking out loud throw you off. You can talk alone. I don't even care right now about the cheaper price, honestly, because it's really cheap. I don't even care right now about the cheaper price, honestly, because it's really cheap. So, like, I mean, like, I was going to ask him about like, okay, well, we just gave Tom like $1,000 and he says he's not going to go get go around. Don't worry. Okay. Yeah, you don't are just just like his time. Yeah, he's he's getting it. He's got to be getting it tonight. We just trust them. It just sounds like he's just like, I don't know like it to me it sounded like he was like waiting for it or going to get it earlier and then he fucking. And then he is like oh yeah I'm at home or whatever but I guess that's what he does is he goes and drops off the money and then, and then a couple hours come and tell him where to go to pick it up. But this dude might want to deal with me more maybe. Yeah, I think that could only but dealing with being that person I'm into like you're driving you're doing. I mean Tom does dangerous. You guys do dangerous dangerous as fuck to drive like that. Yeah, sounds super dangerous. But I mean if I got it if I had a nicer car. I'm hoping to get it soon. I can probably even get this out you because I told I told that to Thomas like well, you know, I want to get it. And Tom told me I'll be able to do that right away probably. I do, I would super suggest, so I do know that to answer your question, as far as like imploding you a certain amount. I know that he is comfortable doing that right because it's just a convenience but like the amount of risk like he doesn't like he's not going to do anything about it like if we get if we gets lost and it's like something about it because I'm his on his side. I have to try to figure out how to get back and and I'm like, yeah, so I mean if you have it over well, this first five would be. I don't know. Yeah, this is the first time that like they get the money. Yeah, or what about if you want to tell them how much money you got because it's probably going to be this next question is like how much you got right now. Well, I gave Tom 1000 and I got probably another 700 cash on me right now just on me and probably I could probably come up with another 1000 right now but this girl wants to and she's got the cash on her. So I'll have and I'm charging her 18 well probably do 19 because I told her I didn't really get the price yet but I told her it was going to be cheaper than what I was charging her which was 21. So I'll have for five grand rate like right away instantly and then this other guy wants three and he's got the cash on hand too and I'm charging him the same. So I'd have the money right away. Are you there. Are you there. I have like six grand right away so that's well over. No, I don't like I have six grand plus another. What two, four, six, 12, I'd have like 10 grand right away. Right, because that's if you want to, and then that's like damn near 4000. One, two, three, four, five, six, 615 either way I'd have, I just texted my buddy to see because he said he had the cash on him. Okay, yeah, the girl still down. You're breaking up again I can't hear. I'm about to text this message. Yeah, by the time, as soon as time gets back, it'll be, we'll be here. Yeah, by the time, as soon as time gets back, it'll be, we'll be here. But you heard so you heard what I just said right, I don't need to send this to you before I send it to him. Yeah. We gave Tom 1000 so he can go grab it. He has almost 1k left right now, and about 4k when he gets back. Yep. Plus, another four if I can get more. At the least, so, or you could just say it just skip all that and just be like, just say I got like. Yeah, just say I got like five, five more grand. What's up buddy. What's up my friend. It might be like easier to explain to him how many you're like look at this week for sure and then like. Yeah, I was just trying to keep it as simple as. But Tom said he didn't mind giving me giving me five, like he finally said it I think after I've been on the phone, because I told him I was in a group chat with you guys. And then, which I'm glad I did tell him that because then Ivan messaged him and asked him if he knew me. So then at least, at least Tom's in the loop and doesn't feel like we're trying to go behind his back. Even though it's not going behind his back on your end and just for me, kind of probably would felt like that. No, I mean, I mean, I don't know if I can't without fully thinking about it, it sounds like being overly courteous, but I'm not. Overly courteous. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Tom is awesome. I mean, I, I haven't like worked with him like for a super long time or anything, but I did spend like the first, I don't know, year and a half that I know knew him, like, I don't know, we actually were some, I already told you all that, but it doesn't really apply right now, but it is funny. I just think it's funny. I think it was, oh, I've almost killed this guy. I didn't even really know him. But yeah, he's great because he does, you know, he does the sketchy shit. He doesn't mind doing it. And he's trustworthy. I guess I'm not going to assume that he's going to be perfect 100% of the time because I don't fucking, nobody's fucking perfect. I just know that he, yeah, I think he's actually been to Mexico. I think Tom has gone down and seen like where he lives on the land. I don't know. He's going to this year. I think he said, that's what I said. I was like, man, if I come out there, like you put me up and he's like, yeah, Tom, Tom said, really funny. I was like, so does, cause I had to have this conversation with him with Tom. I was like, and he's like the only person I really have it with. I was like, dude. So I kind of like, I don't know. I kind of stared with him, like my thought, my full thoughts. I was like, so you think like I told him about how, like, you know, when I first met, I was like, you know, he's like, he seemed like super fucking polite, you know, he was like, you know, soft spoken. And, and, you know, I didn't get like any sort of like negative vibe from like, not non threatening. And if anything, he seemed like, he seemed like he may have been like apprehensive of me, like, because of like, I don't know. I guess I was my trap house at the time. But I, so I was like, I was asking him, Tom, I just read, I mean, do you think he's like cartel? And he's like, I can't really fully remember. I'm pretty sure he's like, he's like, yeah, or maybe I can't maybe you'll have to ask him what his response was. But he said, like, I was like, is he got like a mansion or something? He's like, yeah, it's like a mansion, but it's got dirt floors. I can laugh at that. Yeah. I guess Mexico for that. Yeah, he has some. Yeah, I don't know. I've had to do some kind of odd transactions. And the beginning was, I haven't he'd having me go to like, these Mexican grocery stores, you know, that they have random, like, you know, like, you know, like, like, I don't know. You know, that they have randomly throughout the metro area, and I'd have to go in there. And there's like, all these moms fucking like, buying weird shit. And I have to like, put a money order in for however much money, send it directly to him. Yeah, his workers that his workers are fucking I don't trust his workers like they're, he trusts them enough that he wouldn't like ever let me talk him into fucking replacing them, which I fucking really would like to. But yeah, he just doesn't sound he doesn't sound into that idea. And I think it's, I don't know, maybe it's because he's, they're part of the fucking transporting process. They've been dumping fences and fucking bobbing and weaving. Maybe that's why I have no idea. Yeah.

But he is people. Right? Yeah. It's like Tom and the people in between them are irritating little Spanish. I don't speak English. Well, yeah, that's it. I want to meet those people because I've said the same thing. Sounds like. Huh? Yeah, I've said the same thing a bunch of times and it sounds like they fucking do their own little thing and they piss off. Okay. And. Yeah, that is kind of what it seems like. Is that what you were going to say? Well. Well, they don't. It's like. Because I can feel like he's not going to want to. Get me stuff because it's he's not making anything off of me. You know what I mean? Okay, but it's not you that like he's making money off of like he makes money off of his customers. Like you're like think of it as like you're the same rank as him. I don't know if you want to. Yeah, like that. And that's and and then I did want to like get on like some sort of video call or something because like that's about as like great like close or whatever the fuck you want to say just to be like, hey. Face name face, whatever. And then it kind of goes just to text. The Google Translate or whatever, but. But yeah, that's what I wanted to do. Yeah. And I'm trying to like nail down a time and he said that basically he's got to go up just a little bit past the casino. I don't even know why. I mean, I just like I didn't really have a chance to explain to him that and like, yeah, we trust you and all that. But it's like these sort of practices aren't really like that secure. It's like especially with just getting to know each other. I mean to think that it's something where to go wrong. I mean, that's a totally shatters trust and for future ship. I don't know why somebody would run. Yeah. Right. So I mean, that's what kind of what I was like. Yeah, like I believe him, you know, he's gonna I believe it's gonna be fine. But I just asked him if I could get more than you know, like a couple. And he's like, well. He's like, I don't mind helping you out. But like if it's for other people or anyone else or something. I was like, what the heck? Yeah, for you. Yeah, like he I think he's basically he does. I think he was a little like because the amount of profit that he makes off of the large amounts is like not so much because now he has to share that with you. Yeah. So I mean, it's kind of like I said, not like everybody else gets that price. It's just you. Right. Well, that's what I'm saying. Like, I don't know. You know what I mean? Like I don't because I need that. I mean, I could get rid of five tonight and I think he's probably not picking up that much and he's definitely not probably wanting to drive and do felonies. Because he even kind of mentioned that felonies aren't for free. You know. So confused by what is I really would like you to hear his game plan, but it makes me so irritated. I like over ownership. What? I really want to hear what his game plan is. Why he needed $1,000 to not go someplace is that I'm going to just. I don't know. You're very patient. I don't know if so, he told you that he's going, he's not going, I don't understand. Well, it's just another line with them. Yeah, can we put him on? I should put him on a three-way call or something. Well, yeah, but I want to make sure that you're like. Yeah. Yeah. I know I started to come out that direction. I'm not sure I'd rather do it tomorrow when I'm tired. And you got to work tomorrow. Yeah, it'll work clearly. Yeah. Like, yeah, I'm used to have all day. Um, yeah, it's a fair assessment. Yeah. I mean, there was like a little bit of relaxing in there. Yeah. Tomorrow can be very busy or what? Well, yeah, so that's what, that's kind of where I'm at is like, how can I eventually pick up that amount to on my own where he doesn't feel like, like, he's making nothing, you know? He's not going to make it. He's not ever going to make money off of you. Right. So, there's going to be no incentive for him to go and get it. So, I'm going to eventually going to have to probably get it myself. That's right. I don't know if it's like, I don't know that. What I'm about to say is real or, but it kind of makes sense. But I think like the cost of it down the road. Is like, really, like, it starts out small, but then as people, like, handle it, I think that's how it gets like, up to the amount that it is now. I don't know. I don't know if it's like that. It wouldn't make sense. Like, it is. Yeah. So, I mean. Like, the price in the candy shop is going to stay the same, no matter who picks it up. It's just however many are moving at that time. I guess I'm not really sure. Right. Right. Right. All right. I really wanted to be the guy to go down to Kentucky. Well, yeah, he was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. Yeah, he was. Yeah, he was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. I'm going to ask him, what is it going to take, how much do I have to give him in order for him to give me like five tonight? If you just tell him, tell him that you need that amount, then I, yeah, it should be like a cooperative thing. Shouldn't have to like dance or sing for it. I know, but then he might avoid me and give me the cold shoulder again. In fact, if it's five or more, can you look at discount? Yeah. Right. So that's maybe that's how I was thinking of you called half a and asked him to give homeboy a little bit more, but. I think he only had enough money for what he deals with. I don't know. Yeah. Hey. Five. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I love the word to narrow. What's up? Are you talking to me? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I've set one up before. I mean, yeah, I can. I don't know. I'm struggling with mine. But if you set up yours, it's like the preferred method of texting. And I have been failing to set it up. So I keep on texting him on Facebook. Yeah. Copy paste this text to you. So you can see what I sent him. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. So many people messaging me right now. Well, he'd give that to him without the money. I think it works like that. Yeah, I have one of the big packages, but I do come up here. I get paid off in time. Yeah. No, you don't get to pay that one. But you got to remember, I guess. I guess there is a level of distress because of the last time. I have introduced some people to this. They could take them home. My buddy, Luke, took like eight pounds of them and did it again. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. My buddy, Luke, took like eight pounds of them and did it again. Right after that. Let's go. All right, so now new contact. What's his name? Okay.

It says new group, new contact, new community, new broadcast. I don't know. I don't know. What's up. Well, then I try to call. Let me text you. Yeah. Experiment with us. I don't really know. What's your number? My phone number. You don't know your phone number. I do. I know my device phone number, but I feel it. I thought so too. That's right. Give me your phone number so I can message you and you can see if I have a new number or not. Okay. It's three, two, zero. Seven, seven, five. Nine, one, three, zero. Three, two, zero. Seven, six, three. Why does that work? Seven, six, three. Three. Two zero. Seven, seven, five, nine. So you said. There's no seven, six, three. So three, two, zero. Seven, seven, five, nine, one, three, zero. Yeah. My phone number is not on WhatsApp. Invite to WhatsApp. I thought you could contact anyone on it. I don't know. I don't understand what you're trying. That's what I was saying. I'm trying to figure this out. I feel like I got it working before and it was working fine. But now it's like I redownloaded it and I don't really know how to get it working right again. Oh, that came through. But it still says your name. Oh, okay. That's because I put my name on there. Okay. Messaging. Only people in this chat can read. All right. But I did message through the. Yeah. Not in our regular thread. Yeah. No, no. I didn't get. Okay. Now you're typing. Okay. No. Okay.

Has that ever happened to you? Where you like, you kind of take a mental note of like, where, where, what the last time you've seen, like one of your long term friends and long time friends. And then you just so happen to like, not, you know, life comes, life comes up. I don't know. Actually. So I get what I'm trying to say is I, I kind of had an experience like that. There's this girl that I, we all used to hang out with named Angela Brand. And her place was like the party spot for like a while, a long while, actually. And in her mind, in her mind, it is still the party spot. Yeah. But. Yeah, I remember the last time I like hung out over there. Um, I can't remember the last time before, but it was basically, they were all doing the same thing, drinking, sitting on a couch, watching TV. And when I came back, like years later, like they all looked exactly the same on the older. Yeah. Kind of like King of the Hill. Yeah. Like the reprise of King of the Hill. Like everyone who's still outside drinking beers, but they just look old. Right. Like right. Where are you? Yeah. That's funny. Dude, it's fucking what? Janelle was trying to fucking hustle me a little bit today. Why? I don't know. Huh? The chick that you took to court? Yes. Okay. Why? Um, um, why? Well, we got, I don't know, because I think she, I think it's only natural to some degree that, uh, when you're kind of like just in a kind of a overall kind of harsh environment and somebody is like, I don't know. Bringing you places, being nice, fucking, uh, you know, letting her, letting him hit your vape. And yeah, she's like, at some point she started to get a little weird. It was a little weird. Why? Did she say she was going to like S or D for some money or something? What if I were to say yes? I would say, call the cops. You got harassed. No, it's not. But like, I don't know. We were talking about something, um, I like legitimately recover related and, um, then all of a sudden that like kind of jumps from like, um, you know, like, I don't know. Um, um, yeah, it jumps from my verse. I'm sorry. Just yawned. No yawning. Oh no, it's okay. Now that I'm thinking about her, I'm just going to lay down. I'm just going to close my eyes for a little bit. You can do that when I drive home. Make it here alive. All right. I'm back. What? What? I'm in the middle of the story. Oh yeah, sorry. I just got really tired. Where was I saying? That you guys were talking? Oh yeah, yeah. So we were talking about recovery stuff and then it like kind of shifts to like, like healthy relationships. And I don't know. I really, so here's the deal. I can't, I really can't say that she did or said anything, anything really. I really can't say that she did because she didn't technically say or do anything. But I, she was like, um, I think I had mentioned something about fucking are getting a new vapor or having to get a new vape soon. And cause hers died and she was basically kind of like very extremely subtly like trying to hustle me for a fucking, uh, yeah. Hustle me for fucking beginner cigarettes. But then I was like, uh, you know, I can actually lose my job by doing that. I can't, I shouldn't do that. Right. And I don't know. It was like for a minute when I had said like, you know, kind of put my foot down and it was just kind of a quiet car ride. I also let her drive the vehicle too, by the way. Why would you do that? Because she's an old woman and she was sweet and I just didn't want to fucking drive. Oh, okay. I guess that's fine. How old is she? 47. She's like 10 years older than you, Brandon. She does. It looks like she's fucking 50, 55, but I, of course say the opposite of that statement whenever it comes up. Right. You're like, you don't look a day over 24. You look younger than my baby mom and she's 12. All right, I cleaned up a little bit. Now it looks nice and clean in here. You have my fucking chapstick? No, I don't have your chapstick. I have chapstick, but I don't have your chapstick. All right, whatever. All right, I should be there in a little while. I don't know. As long as I don't get distracted. All right. Yeah, it says you should be here in like 10 minutes. 10 minutes? Where the fuck are you again? I thought you said you were in Monticello. Let me see if you've been driving fast. Directions, eight minutes. You should be here in eight minutes. Where in Monticello are you? At the Walmart. What do you mean? Oh, that's like in fucking Buffalo, bro. No, it's not. It seems like Buffalo. You have the directions on, correct? Yeah. Where you're going? Okay. Yeah, but they lie. They lie sometimes. All right. Oh, God.

No, my mom like let me borrow these running shoes of hers. But like I think why she doesn't use them anymore is because like the back of it like was starting to come like open or something and like there's like I don't know if it's like a hard plastic or like a metal piece or what it would be but like it was rubbing the back of my ankle and now my ankle hurts. Yeah. That's terrible. That's not. Yeah. And I told her I was like, what can I put here? And she just said she would get me new tennis shoes. So I was like, cool. So who knows when she'll buy me new tennis shoes, but I can't quite hear you. Oh. I don't know. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hello. Yeah. So what do you just get to the same a second ago? I said that I messaged the daycare to let them know because well, I told I forget what her name is the lady that I was talking to. I said that I messaged the daycare to let them know because well, I told I forget what her name is the lady that I was talking to this morning because it wasn't Karen, but it was the other older lady that my mom is going to be picking up the boys at 345 today. And then I just made sure she remembered like I knew she remembered but kind of just messaged her like hey, I told the daycare you'd be there at 345. 345 because yeah, she's going to leave work at 3 I think and then it takes her like 20 minutes and then she has to go pick up the my brother's car. So hopefully they don't get to I mean, it's only like 15 minutes more because they say that they have to get picked up at 3. Because that's when everyone wakes up for naps and who knows maybe Alex will be awake and it won't even be a problem, but Who knows? Oh, I wish I was sitting in front of a heater right now. Yeah.

No, this place it's like in the middle like right by like where most like service desks are for Walmart like it's like in the middle by the registers and stuff but like this Walmart is just fucking cold all the time like no matter what season it is like they have like the AC on or something and it's because they don't have they don't have it on site the thermometer it's like at corporate or something like they don't have it on site. Like at corporate or something like it's not even controlled in this store. Yeah, so it's just freezing in here all the time. Yeah, that's kind of weird. I mean, I know that they like to be able to control that shit from like somewhere else, right? Yeah. Like why can't they be blasting the heat like it's winter time? It's cold. So that place doesn't have like the the registers that blow really hard when you walk in the front vestibule. Yeah, I mean they do there but that's like the only place that it's warm. It's like when you first walk in. Yeah. Like once you walk in it gets just like fucking cold. What am I gonna do? I don't know. Why don't you just sit there and close your eyes. I wish I could do. I made her drive. Oh, man, that breaks almost over. It's crazy how fucking fast 30 minutes goes when I'm sitting down and relaxing. But when it's just when I'm standing there doesn't go by that fast.

Well, this I think I'm gonna try to like do some like yoga or like light stretching first since like I'm already sore and then walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes, but maybe walk on the bigger treadmill so that I could do an incline and then do another like 10-20 minute workout. Yeah. 10-20 minute workout with your brother? No, like just on the TV in there. Like I look up a YouTube video and tells me what to do. Yeah.

But if we had to, you could tell me that meth was coke, and that would be fine too. Well, that's very sincere. That's what I did just now. No, yeah, I'm a sincere guy. I don't mind if you lie to me. I'm actually fresh out. Yeah, if you smile and mix it up, I don't fucking know the difference. She's out of the meth though. Oh, good. That's a good one. Because you know what that means.

All right, say it again. I just want you guys to be very, very quiet. Like, probably don't even talk in the hallways. I'll remind them, yeah. I'll remind them. Yeah, well, you too. Because you'll say something and I'm sure, you know, and I'll get him going. And I just want to be very low key. I want to be very quiet. I've had a lot of traffic in here and I don't want to... I don't want to piss my neighbors off. I don't want to be that girl that makes people mad. Yeah, I'm not going to have friends over anymore. And I told you that, actually. I did tell you that. You should stop selling these drugs out of your place. I don't even know you. I'm not selling drugs. I don't sell drugs. Baked googs, whatever the fucking Amish are doing these days.

Like, um, um, I had to pull over because I was in, I put the truck, the car in limp mode and on a, you know, where you're going out of Mora towards like down 23 and you take a left to go to fucking Anoka. Yeah. Uh, I'm at that fucking little business right before that left. Yeah. Um, but like, so I pulled in, you know, turned around and I got like no power steering. And then, uh, typically when that happened in the past, I would just fucking shut the vehicle off, you know, let it sit for a second and, uh, you know, I would start it back up and then it would fucking be okay. But this time, this time when I started off and I tried to start it back up, like the dash just like flashed and then like it, like, I don't know, there's like no power, like it's killing the power to this ignition right now, which is, um, uh, not gonna allow me to start the vehicle, but I'm going to give it another try to hopefully just back to normal. Yeah. Oh my gosh, dude. Yeah. It looks like the fucking, it looks like the fucking, uh, you had a fucking power steering light and that's back to normal now. So it's cool now you're going to be able to get home. Uh, yeah. I mean, I was a little fucking freaked out there for a second because it got, I've never seen it do that before. Well, I've had to do that before. Like when I had, when I took it to the dealership and I had them replace the fucking whatever the chip or whatever it was called. Cause when I was driving once it, like the power steering went out and the like speedometer just went to zero or like it didn't, it didn't go to zero, but it stayed at a certain number. And then it was like, yeah, it said three, but like it was whatever speed I was going, but it didn't go down when I started slowing down or speeding up. Like it just stayed at whatever number it was. Yeah. I think I know what you're talking about, but yeah, that's what happens. Like when it goes into limp mode, like it'll go to third gear and like when you push your foot on the gas, like it'll kind of sound like you're, it'll give you, it will give you a little bit more speed, but like really puts the RPMs up and then like it's that's limp mode. Yeah. So what are we going to have to do to fix that? The reason why the way limp mode works is like if the car detects that there's some significant issue going on, like maybe it's like your oil pressure sensor light, like which is the same exact thing. I had, I was talking to you on that guy's car, or basically you got to fix what it is, whatever it is that is making that happen, because it's causing it to go into limp mode because the car, the car automatically puts itself in limp mode whenever it is seen, it seen errors come up that could become catastrophic. Okay. So it's trying to protect itself. So it does that? Yes. So that the user doesn't blow up the car. Okay. Well, I guess we've got to figure out what the fuck that means, fix that before our only other car goes out. I just wanted to kind of let you know, because I thought you were going to have to fucking come pick me up for a second. Okay. Well, drive safely. Yeah. All right.

I would Yeah, if you were me, how are you I would sell that outright get my money for That way you're not losing any money at all because you said oh like five grand, right? Yeah, we put yeah, we put down like I think we put down like seven or eight and I think we still owe like Yeah, I think yeah, five four or five grand left is what we owe. Yeah, so In reality, yes, I'll take it But you got to think about the negative equity that you're going to be rolling over into the new loan Yeah, right, right. It's like when the cars were five grand five six thousand You can get that sell it pay off the loan to old loan And just have a new loan. So you're not you're not really rolling any negative equity I mean give you the best deal in the city for sure. Anyway, you can't let I'll be basically up charging a vehicle to to pay off that car for you If that makes sense Right. Yeah So it's like you're better off just paying the car off Um Yeah, that's what I was gonna say Paying the car off Um Do you guys have a bank you guys deal with or um, I think I can't remember who she got the financing through. I don't think she like went through like Her own bank or anything. I think it was like the financing company that the dealership offered Okay, does she she has decent credit there? Uh, yeah, but we actually also did get a co-signer though Oh, she had to get co-signer. Yeah her mom. Okay, so That might change now because she's been paying alone so yeah Yeah, she's made every single payment like super on time like she's fucking yeah, she's a she's a Yeah, um anyways, she's she's responsible with her money it's not like all rambunctious like me All right Yeah, I can definitely get you guys into something um That is just the finance part Um, what I can do is I can see um What I can do is I can actually run her credit see uh, well, I don't know if whatever you guys want to do um So this is what you should do yeah, tell me what I should do like because okay so Go on my website, right? Apply for a loan That way I can see Exactly what we're working with And it doesn't have to be the specific car on there I can use it for another vehicle if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah so That's what we should do Because that that'll put you ahead of the game and then you're already locked in with a finance I can see what I can get you approved for And then how much you got to put down And what exact card that you want Okay and then um, I know that she's gonna she's gonna fucking say this to me like um How long is that uh approval or like uh, if we were to get 90 days? 90 days Okay, and so she keeps on saying like brendan. Why aren't you fucking making this plan closer to when we get our taxes back? And i'm like, I don't know i'm just fucking being proactive.

I know that's not easy man And uh Just keep going. Thank you.

I think the way the whole billing is set up Altogether is actually the problem Because oh for sure Honestly like the way that they because if somebody like The way we've been taught like all health care providers Like if you go to counseling whatever a doctor like they just like make a record that you went there and this Is what you were seen for? But like if you as a patient were to like challenge that and say like I never did that like then there's like a whole fucking investigation and like if you don't have if that Provider doesn't have like some supporting documents other than them just recording it like you could get them for fraud Oh, yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, so the company I work for is called generation hope and Like we so we bill like normal, but then we also have like a third party like software that like cross-references like the information that we put in there, so Yeah, so if somebody asks like hey, did you do this and yeah, I don't know but that's Yeah, so that's kind of what i've learned but i'll uh, i'm gonna did you text me that address uh Yeah, I did. Yep. All right, cool i'm gonna send it out to gabby and uh And you said even if the vehicle that we don't we don't even if we don't see a vehicle on there.

Like, that all sounds, like, fine, I guess, but I don't know, I'm gonna have to, like, call or, like, talk to my mom tonight and see if she could pick up the kids then, because, like I said, tomorrow's Thursday, someone has to pick them up by, like, 3.30. Yeah. And now it sounds like if we were, if you were running a little late, like, even if we did commence the daycare, like, we have to pick them up by 5.30, and if I'm, if you're running late, like, we're running late, like, we wouldn't get there until, like, 5.20 or something, 5.30. Yeah. Let's see. Dude, I might, we might, I might have to have, like, Kiana come and meet up with me tonight, because she doesn't work tomorrow. What, what's she gonna do for you? Watch the, like, kids. What do you mean, watch the kids? Do you know anybody else that's gonna, like, watch the kids? And I know that she's not working tomorrow, so. Well, where do you expect her to watch the kids? I just fucking, you know what, it's not my fucking problem, you figure it out, it's my first idea, and I like it so far, so if you have questions, maybe call her. I'll just ask my mom. No, I'll just ask my mom, because. That's fine, all right, bye. All right, when are you gonna be home? That's a good question. According to this fucking work that I'm supposed to do on this thing, it's supposed to be, like, it should be, like, like, along with having to go pick up parts, like, it should take me, like, three hours, like, maybe two and a half. Okay, I thought you said you weren't gonna do the work today. I wasn't planning on it, but it's, like, really much more simple than I thought it was going to be, so. Yeah, but I'm, whatever, I'm not even gonna say my comment, but. What? I mean, I would reconsider that, Brennan, it's getting dark, and you think that every time you're gonna do a car thing, you're like, oh, yeah, it's gonna be super simple, and then you're out until, like, three in the morning, and you're like, that was way harder than I thought. Yeah, I mean, that is a good point, but I guess I, although I sent the guy the price of the parts and all that shit, I need to hear him say, like, yes, I want to do that tonight, and, yeah, he, so, yeah, I just, but I just wanted to give you a call and kind of find out how you were doing, and I don't know, for some reason, I guess I like talking to you, but, you know, every time I talk to you, I get reminded that you're difficult. All right, all right, I'll let you get going. All right, well, don't forget, you have kids. They miss you. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, clearly, Alex was, like, freaking out every time you left the room last night. Yeah, I miss him, too. All right, well, yeah, I'll try to figure something out, hopefully, mom, when she gets home. All right, just be, just be, like, oh, please, please, please, please, mom, oh, I'll do anything, I'll do anything, I'll make Brandon do the dishes. I'll do your laundry. I'm just kidding, I'm sorry. I mean, to me, that sounds like an opportunity to, like, the boys can go hang out with the girls for the day. All right, I gotta get going, so, because I don't want to just drive around St. Cloud. I gotta call this guy and figure out, oh, all right, he's texting me now. All right, bye.

But, we're not doing anything for him from this point on. And, even if he does reach out, if he doesn't have insurance, and he's not billable, then we do not help him. Right.

Uh... Okay, well, I guess it's really weird, and it would be kind of, like, humbling for me to tell you, but, um, uh, yeah, it implies something I did wrong a long time ago, but, uh, I was having a conversation with Ella, and, um, and it kind of turned into, like, I was, like, trying to level with her.

And I was, like, I was, like, well, honestly, it's because I kind of was hoping you had forgotten it ever happened. Yeah. And then I, um, and then, uh, yeah, so that conversation, you know, it developed, you know, I wanted it to be, uh, better than the, that version that I had with my dad, so I knew, like, what to say, and I told her all the, you know, no, yeah, I was hoping you didn't remember that, and I was, that was not okay of me to do, and, like, and there's no way I could ever explain anything to you that's gonna make it sound like, uh, it's, I was, I was in the right for doing that, and you deserve that, and I was, like, you just deserve that, you mean a lot, and, uh, you know, and it, and she's, like, and I was like, if you ever want to know, like, this isn't an excuse, but if you ever want to know why that may have happened, like, it has to do with, like, kind of what happened to me when I was a kid, and. Wow. And, um, yeah, it was just, it turned out to be a good conversation, though, like, uh, she's happy, I mean, I said all the right things. Aw, that's good. That's a tough conversation to have. It was. I mean, it is. It's awkward. I mean, I mean, because I think there's so many situations where parents these days are like, oh, shit, I'm not, I think it's about this meme, and it's like, when you, like, try to bring up past trauma to your mom, who's like, I didn't do that. I didn't. I don't, I can't remember. I'm going to have to find that fucking meme, but, yeah. Deny it? Hmm? Or, yeah, they try to deny it. Yeah, yeah, it's like, I'm going to fucking, I'm going to send, I'll send this meme to you after fucking, you probably start your break, your break's done or something, but, Uh, yeah, let's see what else weird shit do I got going on. Uh, that, like, all this work stuff that's going on weird, and then this hanging, wanting to fucking sleep with you and fucking go do all my druggy things, I guess that's about as crazy as it gets. Hmm. Yeah, I am. You're funny. Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to relax. You know, a lot of fucking, a lot of drama going on, which is good, like, I just want to not have to deal with these people anymore, so I'm glad the drama is going on where I don't have to talk to them. The drama, like, um, with some of the people that are picking up from you or something? Well, that, and then, like, guys that want to sleep with me. Mm-hmm. That I just would never, wouldn't want. Yeah. Um, and they just don't get it, but I'm, like, such a good person that I, like, still try to help them out, and I try to be there for them, and, like, you know, like, I just gave this guy a ride home yesterday, been stranded at his cousin's house for, like, a week. I drove all the way from Minneapolis to go to, to drive him home, um, when I didn't have time for that, and I just did that, and he keeps, like, you know, making passes, like, he wants to sleep with me, and I keep telling him, like, he's, like, you know, good friends with one of my exes, and I just told him, like, it's not right, I don't feel right about it, and instead of respecting my boundaries, he just keeps going, and, and so he said something today, like, something about, oh, I'll give you a back massage or something, and I said, not a chance, slow dance, and then he just started going off on me, and I'm, like, you know what, fuck you, dude. Yeah. That's, I'm sorry to hear that. That is, like, you want to hang out with people because, like, you, you adore the friendship, but then you kind of find out that it's, like, oh, I'm just a fuck, a fuck boy, or I'm a fuck toy? Yeah, you want to hang out with me just to fuck me? Yeah, that bugs me. That happens to me a lot. Yeah. Well, it just hurts, because, like, I just, like, you know, I don't like rejection, and I don't, whatever, and I want to be friends, and, and when it comes to being, like, only, they're only being friends with me for... Their chance to hit it? Yeah, their idea. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, it is a, you are very good looking, though, and you are very, just, a nice, you're, I don't know, you're kind of, like, like, honey. I don't know. Sweet, but sticky? Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what I was thinking. But I, I do, I'm sorry that you had to experience that. Yeah, it's all good, it's just, it's irritating. It's your cross to bear, I know. But anyway. Yeah, I'm, I'm actually just about to start doing this diagnostic for this person, and... Okay.

Oh, yeah? Yeah, dude, it's crazy. I've already talked to, like, fucking ten people today. Somebody called and woke me up at, like, 7.30 in the morning, because of a crisis. Oh, really? A mental health crisis. Yeah. I didn't know that I... I didn't know I did those things for people. Hmm. Yeah, I'm like an emotional support person. Oh, wow. Ah, it doesn't sound... I didn't think I was... I did that sort of thing, but I guess I do. Yeah. Good to know. You want me to be your emotional support person? I do. Dude, I fucking support you so good. You're so dumb. Yeah, I know. It just doesn't even roll off the tongue. Damn, dude, I'm, like, so incredibly busy out here in St. Cloud. It is crazy. Like, I don't even... I don't even want to be out in St. Cloud, really, but it's, like, just fucking crazy taking off. It is crazy. Hmm. I kind of feel like a crackhead driving around, and, like, I don't know, all these people that I meet with, they all got, like, issues, and I'm, like, I'm, like, good, dude. Like, my biggest issue is, like, uh, I don't know, actually, yeah, I do. I guess I do have one or two weird things going on. Oh, yeah? Go ahead. Oh, my gosh. You really want to know? Yeah. Um... Uh... Okay, well, I guess it's really weird, and it would be kind of, like, humbling for me to tell you, but, um, uh, yeah, it implies something I did wrong a long time ago, but, uh, I was having a conversation with Ella, and, um, and it kind of turned into, like, I was, like, trying to level with her. I'm, like, what's on your mind, like, if you can talk to me about whatever you want, you know, even if you think it's going to make me, like, weird or mad, like, you know, I know you love me, and I know you, whatever, and then, uh, I finally got her to say it, and then, uh, she basically explained to me that, um, she's, like, do you remember, like, when we were really young, and you, like, got mad, and you, like, grabbed me by the throat, and, like, like, threw me on the bed, and I was, like, yeah, I remember that, and she's, like, I was just kind of wondering why you, like, never brought that up or never said sorry or anything. And I was, like, I was, like, well, honestly, it's because I kind of was hoping you had forgotten it ever happened. Yeah. And then I, um, and then, uh, yeah, so that conversation, you know, it developed, you know, I wanted it to be, uh, better than the, that version that I had with my dad, so I knew, like, what to say, and I told her all the, you know, no, yeah, I was hoping you didn't remember that, and I was, that was not okay of me to do, and, like, and there's no way I could ever explain anything to you that's gonna make it sound like, uh, it's, I was, I was in the right for doing that, and you deserve that, and I was, like, you just deserve that, you mean a lot, and, uh, you know, and it, and she's, like, and I was like, if you ever want to know, like, this isn't an excuse, but if you ever want to know why that may have happened, like, it has to do with, like, kind of what happened to me when I was a kid, and. Wow. And, um, yeah, it was just, it turned out to be a good conversation, though, like, uh, she's happy, I mean, I said all the right things. Aw, that's good. That's a tough conversation to have. It was. I mean, it is. It's awkward. I mean, I mean, because I think there's so many situations where parents these days are like, oh, shit, I'm not, I think it's about this meme, and it's like, when you, like, try to bring up past trauma to your mom, who's like, I didn't do that. I didn't. I don't, I can't remember. I'm going to have to find that fucking meme, but, yeah. Deny it? Hmm? Or, yeah, they try to deny it. Yeah, yeah, it's like, I'm going to fucking, I'm going to send, I'll send this meme to you after fucking, you probably start your break, your break's done or something, but, Uh, yeah, let's see what else weird shit do I got going on. Uh, that, like, all this work stuff that's going on weird, and then this hanging, wanting to fucking sleep with you and fucking go do all my druggy things, I guess that's about as crazy as it gets. Hmm. Yeah, I am. You're funny. Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to relax. You know, a lot of fucking, a lot of drama going on, which is good, like, I just want to not have to deal with these people anymore, so I'm glad the drama is going on where I don't have to talk to them. The drama, like, um, with some of the people that are picking up from you or something? Well, that, and then, like, guys that want to sleep with me. Mm-hmm. That I just would never, wouldn't want. Yeah. Um, and they just don't get it, but I'm, like, such a good person that I, like, still try to help them out, and I try to be there for them, and, like, you know, like, I just gave this guy a ride home yesterday, been stranded at his cousin's house for, like, a week. I drove all the way from Minneapolis to go to, to drive him home, um, when I didn't have time for that, and I just did that, and he keeps, like, you know, making passes, like, he wants to sleep with me, and I keep telling him, like, he's, like, you know, good friends with one of my exes, and I just told him, like, it's not right, I don't feel right about it, and instead of respecting my boundaries, he just keeps going, and, and so he said something today, like, something about, oh, I'll give you a back massage or something, and I said, not a chance, slow dance, and then he just started going off on me, and I'm, like, you know what, fuck you, dude. Yeah. That's, I'm sorry to hear that. That is, like, you want to hang out with people because, like, you, you adore the friendship, but then you kind of find out that it's, like, oh, I'm just a fuck, a fuck boy, or I'm a fuck toy? Yeah, you want to hang out with me just to fuck me? Yeah, that bugs me. That happens to me a lot. Yeah. Well, it just hurts, because, like, I just, like, you know, I don't like rejection, and I don't, whatever, and I want to be friends, and, and when it comes to being, like, only, they're only being friends with me for... Their chance to hit it? Yeah, their idea. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, it is a, you are very good looking, though, and you are very, just, a nice, you're, I don't know, you're kind of, like, like, honey. I don't know. Sweet, but sticky? Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what I was thinking. But I, I do, I'm sorry that you had to experience that. Yeah, it's all good, it's just, it's irritating.

Yeah, I'm actually at one of the homeless shelters up here, the nicer one right now. I just did a tour here yesterday, and a tour of the other place. I know that they can have dogs, and I think Zach would like it.

But if they're in recovery, then they get a room right away. That's just for the day or two.

You've just been kind of tired and making it through your appointments and everything. No, I was sick last weekend. I missed a couple of big appointments, but I've rescheduled one and working on rescheduling the other. Yeah. Yeah, making appointments is hard for me. The medical gets overwhelming sometimes. Yeah. So, I mean, I know that I've heard a bunch of stuff talk, like, from Zach and, like, I've never really directly talked with you about it, but I know that you guys were trying to get a new PCA. I am, yeah. You know, like, that I'm kind of like a PCA, but I'm not a PCA, but I'm that person for Zach. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what those initials meant, right? The CNS or whatever it was. Yeah, CPRS, yeah. DPRS, okay. Yeah, I guess if that crossed my mind, like, I know that you really do need to make those appointments, all those things, but if you are having a struggle with getting PCA services, you might be easier getting, like, a CPRS like me, like, somebody from my office to come and work with you and tell you, again, they can get all those other things set up. They're kind of like an arms worker, but we're just way cooler. I have an arms worker, and I would have to agree. Yeah, honestly, like, I know, like, how much work and how many things I do for people, and, like, I don't know, I wish, I mean, I'm pretty sure a PCA and, like, an arms worker, like, all those people are supposed to be, like, as helpful as I am, but I don't think I've ever heard anybody doing all the things that we do. Right. Well, if you could help Zach get that HRA, that would be awesome. Hell yeah. All right, that'll work out good. All right, well, it was good talking with you. I'll try calling back again and hitting up Zach. He's right here. Well, my appointment's about to start. I was about to head out to go buy a fucking charging cord. It's shocking. I know.

Well, obviously you did because it's right on the nose and this is what's being said to me. And a conversation between you and I stays between you and I. If you need to tell your clients something else, don't say you have to go pick up Red or another client by name. For one, that's HIPAA. For two, it's best to just word it as in, I have an emergency with a client right now I have to deal with, but I will come back to you after I get done with that or else we can reschedule. Oh, I guess I didn't even fully comprehend because, you know, Anthony knew that I wasn't like, I didn't have like an appointment with him or anything like that. I wasn't planning on spending any time with him. I was just going to give him like a ride from like his house to the gas station. That was it. We weren't going to do anything more than that. Well, he, I think, took it as in, I got pushed to the back burner for Red. So I do want to point, he's, he called me this morning at 7, like 7 a.m. this morning and we've just been like furious, flipping out. And I've been able to like try to keep him calm. And then like, and then I like basically went and dropped my kids off and did everything I had to do with him in my ear while I called the county, the DHS again. And yeah, yeah, but just like at one point I had to get off the phone with him and he's like cursing Heidi's name. And I, some, because he didn't get this right the first time, but, but my point is, is like he's just fired up and I'm not, I wouldn't really take anything that he says right now very seriously just because he's, I mean, he's, yeah, I mean, he's experiencing, he's going through it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so I don't know. I apologize. I wouldn't, I wouldn't let anything. I am, yeah, I don't mean to have him throw heat your way. I just wouldn't take it very seriously. Right. But I mean, what I'm trying to point out here is this all could have been avoidable. You know what I mean? Okay. You're right. I totally, you're absolutely right. I didn't think that that was going to be a thing and I should have thought about it. And if he wanted to ride down to the County, he knows that I have admin time, two hours a day, nine to 11. I can take them in those times. You know, I've done a lot for Anthony. Heck, I went out to Clearwater twice for him. Friday, you know what I mean? Not billable at nine o'clock at night. Right. So I'm just, I'm a little bit frustrated for this situation. Yeah. Because now he's mad at me because I didn't know that you were coming over to meet up with him and we have no communication. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I haven't had been able to get back to anybody cause I was like, Miles called me and yeah, I wasn't, I would've called, I would've called Anthony like as soon as I got back on the road, but since Miles, you know, he called me and I didn't know what it was for and yeah, I can't just, Hey, but I, I'm sorry. I'll apologize on my behalf and also on Anthony's behalf. You do work super hard for everybody around here and you don't deserve to be talked to you like that. I mean, I get it and it's a rookie mistake. Just know that if we have conversations between ourselves, don't have the same conversation with the client. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I know that him and Red have like had slight differences lately, so I knew to keep them like separate and like try to advocate that they get along and, you know, do the mature thing. And I did say something to both of them to that nature, but I, but yeah, I apologize. I could have done better. And I mean, it's up to you if you want to try reaching out to Anthony and take him to the County. I mean, I'm for getting him down to the County. You know what I mean? It's just, I mean, I could, I, because I have a, I actually do have like an appointment. I'm supposed to be at a certain time. All I could do is pick him up and drop him off. And I've been like, and my game plan was to try to keep him super calm because he's actually, I don't know, the shit that he's saying is not, he doesn't have his meds. He's been off his meds for a while. And if they don't fucking tell me what I want to hear, I'm releasing the dog in the office. I'm like, no, you're not dude. That's not right. So, all right. Well, keep me updated. Okay. All right.

I send it to the county and then we just wait until we hear back from the county. Was this process probably take like anywhere from a couple days to like a week or two? That I don't know because each county is different. I don't have timelines for BHS. That is out of my hands, unfortunately, so I don't know. Okay, that's cool. If you want to send it to my email and I can have them fill it out, that would be awesome. Okay, I'll do that right now and then I'll send it to him. I also made the profile through Dagan yesterday, so he's in presenting now. So, yeah. Okay, perfect. Thank you. Yep. All right, I'll follow up with you once I complete that.

No, old man Red here in the building. I got you. I know you said that you give him a ride home when you leave the office, usually. Is that the time frame you're thinking?

It was like rough in the morning, but after I went to my counselor's office again this morning, she like helped me out, so I found a couple of friends and stuff. What did you expand on? How many more? So like this morning, it was just like super rough. I went to my first hour after my tour, and I was only in that class for like a couple minutes just because like I was doing my tour during that class. And then second hour, I hated second hour. It was horrible. I don't know. I just didn't know the material like we were already doing work and like the teacher had me do it and I just like didn't know what we were doing at all. You're like pretending pretty much? Not even that. And then also like when it was like work time, everybody just like everyone that was around me like left. I'm like, what the hell? Like why not say it? Sorry. I'm trying to understand. You're going to get a picture in my mind. Like what you're doing by all your statements, but I'm really having a hard time without you telling me more. So I was like, so like my geometry teacher, she like sat me down and she's just like, okay, you can like sit here. I'm like, okay, sounds good. I like sat there and then once like work time, like once we started working on like what she assigned, like everybody that was sitting next to me like left and went to like a different part of the room. I'm like, right. Okay. You didn't know if you were supposed to follow them or like? Well, no, I wasn't going to follow them. But it's not like that left the classroom. They just like left this part of the classroom that they were in. To like work on an assignment on their work together. Like it was kind of a clicky thing or is it? Yeah, like that. It was like a quickie thing. How long were you kind of sitting by yourself after that? Don't have to do the work or whatever. Yeah, so I like I didn't know what I was doing and then also like on top of that. Like I was like that not having your second hour. Yeah, sorry, excuse me. But yeah, second hour is weird. And then third hour it was my advisory. So I didn't go to that because I was in the counselor's office. Like it was rough. Third hour is your advisory. You didn't go to that because you were in the counselor's office. Yeah. And then what do you say about afterwards? So you said that you went to the counselor's office and then you met some people. Yeah, so my counselor. She like I guess kind of like helped me find some friends. So instead of going I also didn't go to my fourth hour. So what was it? So yeah, when I went to my stop Milo. I went to fifth hour and my fifth hour is lunch. So I did that and I found some like so instead of going to my fourth hour. What I did was like. There's like this room that like some kids go to to like just like, you know, like work on stuff and like skip class. I guess and that's where I was except the counselor told me to go there. So I could like find some friends. So I met Janae and then I met Aubrey and then I ate lunch with them and then they introduced me to like a bunch of people then also. So then I met Ava T. I met Hannah. And then I met Jury also. You're saying all these names really fast. I don't know how you are so good at like remembering people's names and I can't remember after five minutes. Well, I did forget this one girl's name. I have like three classes with her but I asked her what her name was earlier today like twice. And I'm like, I like forgot. I just like don't remember and I feel horrible because she's super nice and like she's super pretty. So when you see her tomorrow, you're going to be like, hey, I'm going to fucking ask Hannah what her name is again. So you don't have to ask her directly. Yeah, I'm not trying to ask her three times. That's insane. It's also like kind of rude. I fucking experience that all the time. I know. It's horrible. Yeah. It's highly ridiculous. I don't know if it's any consolation. I feel that way. All those family events that I go to with Gabby and I go and I see her fucking family and we had to go to another dinner tonight and because like Sophie got married and yeah, so it was like the whole family went out to eat. Yeah. I don't know. This is like probably the most we've seen her family in a long time. Yeah, but that's what I was thinking too. Yeah, I like barely if I can remember everybody's name and I know what happened since they were like kids, but I don't know. So I'm like sitting across the table from them like to like two or three times this week and I'm like, sorry, you're the girlfriend but or you're the brother and I know I've seen you a couple times, but I don't know your fucking name. Yeah, that's why I'm with like the entire family. I don't know anyone there. Yeah, that's why I don't really like going to those events. It's like I don't know who anybody is and honestly, but being totally honest with him when I went to my office in St. Cloud this morning like I had to say the same thing of three or four other people because I've known for like six months now. I'm like, I'm sorry. Actually. I called this guy Brian Kevin called this dude Kevin three times before he's like, it's Brian and I'm like, oh god, I wish I hadn't gotten that wrong. I'm embarrassed. Right? He's got a sense of humor. Just like kind of a dry dark sense of humor. So once she once I'm you know, he comfortable with me, I'm sure he'll probably retaliate with being a dick about it, but in a funny sort of way. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, I'm talking about that though. You know, the office I'm talking about. Yeah. I'm on the phone with dad. No way. Yes. I don't know why I'm writing down your friend's names right now. I don't know why you're writing writing them down either. I'm doing kind of like some fucking work before I said, well, I did technically actually kind of all my work on a computer.

I went to St. Cloud for work, then back tomorrow, then to Minneapolis and back. When the second half of the day I had the boys with me. And they were getting kind of cooped up in the car. So that was a little irritating. Right. Alex, be quiet, dude. Well, I just wanted to call and I was curious about how your day went. I'm really happy to hear you met some people. And I think it's kind of turned around on the second half of the day. How do you feel about tomorrow? I feel like tomorrow is going to be better than today. Yeah. Yeah, I think tomorrow is going to be a lot better. Because, you know, I found some people Ava T. She's literally like the exact same person as me. I swear. Ava T. Yeah, Ava T. There's a lot of Avas. Ella's texting me. Did you shut off my data on my phone? Like, yeah. She's like, why? Because you told me you didn't care. Right. And I was like, I also told her I'm busy with work. She wants any of the conversations. You have to call me. And then she continues to text me and whatever. So she's irritating. Yeah, that is weird. What are the girls doing now anyway? They're talking behind me. Yeah. They talk about stupid girl stuff like eyeliner and whatever. Yeah, pretty much. Fair enough. Okay. Well, I love you. I love you too. All right.

What's up? What'd you say? How did your first day go? It was like rough in the morning, but after I went to my counselor's office again this morning, she like helped me out, so I found a couple of friends and stuff. What did you expand on? How many more? So like this morning, it was just like super rough. I went to my first hour after my tour, and I was only in that class for like a couple minutes just because like I was doing my tour during that class. And then second hour, I hated second hour. It was horrible. I don't know. I just didn't know the material like we were already doing work and like the teacher had me do it and I just like didn't know what we were doing at all. You're like pretending pretty much? Not even that. And then also like when it was like work time, everybody just like everyone that was around me like left. I'm like, what the hell? Like why not say it? Sorry. I'm trying to understand. You're going to get a picture in my mind. Like what you're doing by all your statements, but I'm really having a hard time without you telling me more. So I was like, so like my geometry teacher, she like sat me down and she's just like, okay, you can like sit here. I'm like, okay, sounds good. I like sat there and then once like work time, like once we started working on like what she assigned, like everybody that was sitting next to me like left and went to like a different part of the room. I'm like, right. Okay. You didn't know if you were supposed to follow them or like? Well, no, I wasn't going to follow them. But it's not like that left the classroom. They just like left this part of the classroom that they were in. To like work on an assignment on their work together. Like it was kind of a clicky thing or is it? Yeah, like that. It was like a quickie thing. How long were you kind of sitting by yourself after that? Don't have to do the work or whatever. Yeah, so I like I didn't know what I was doing and then also like on top of that. Like I was like that not having your second hour. Yeah, sorry, excuse me. But yeah, second hour is weird. And then third hour it was my advisory. So I didn't go to that because I was in the counselor's office. Like it was rough. Third hour is your advisory. You didn't go to that because you were in the counselor's office. Yeah. And then what do you say about afterwards? So you said that you went to the counselor's office and then you met some people. Yeah, so my counselor. She like I guess kind of like helped me find some friends. So instead of going I also didn't go to my fourth hour. So what was it? So yeah, when I went to my stop Milo. I went to fifth hour and my fifth hour is lunch. So I did that and I found some like so instead of going to my fourth hour. What I did was like. There's like this room that like some kids go to to like just like, you know, like work on stuff and like skip class. I guess and that's where I was except the counselor told me to go there. So I could like find some friends. So I met Janae and then I met Aubrey and then I ate lunch with them and then they introduced me to like a bunch of people then also. So then I met Ava T. I met Hannah. And then I met Jury also. You're saying all these names really fast. I don't know how you are so good at like remembering people's names and I can't remember after five minutes. Well, I did forget this one girl's name. I have like three classes with her but I asked her what her name was earlier today like twice. And I'm like, I like forgot. I just like don't remember and I feel horrible because she's super nice and like she's super pretty. So when you see her tomorrow, you're going to be like, hey, I'm going to fucking ask Hannah what her name is again. So you don't have to ask her directly. Yeah, I'm not trying to ask her three times. That's insane. It's also like kind of rude. I fucking experience that all the time. I know. It's horrible. Yeah. It's highly ridiculous. I don't know if it's any consolation. I feel that way. All those family events that I go to with Gabby and I go and I see her fucking family and we had to go to another dinner tonight and because like Sophie got married and yeah, so it was like the whole family went out to eat. Yeah. I don't know. This is like probably the most we've seen her family in a long time. Yeah, but that's what I was thinking too. Yeah, I like barely if I can remember everybody's name and I know what happened since they were like kids, but I don't know. So I'm like sitting across the table from them like to like two or three times this week and I'm like, sorry, you're the girlfriend but or you're the brother and I know I've seen you a couple times, but I don't know your fucking name. Yeah, that's why I'm with like the entire family. I don't know anyone there. Yeah, that's why I don't really like going to those events. It's like I don't know who anybody is and honestly, but being totally honest with him when I went to my office in St. Cloud this morning like I had to say the same thing of three or four other people because I've known for like six months now. I'm like, I'm sorry. Actually. I called this guy Brian Kevin called this dude Kevin three times before he's like, it's Brian and I'm like, oh god, I wish I hadn't gotten that wrong. I'm embarrassed.

You want to text him and just tell him? He's honestly, it's kind of weird getting a hold of him. Because even though I have his phone number, and I talked to him like over the phone, he does not text me on it from his phone number. He's like, I have to text him on Facebook to get ahold of him. It's weird. Yeah, I don't know, try texting him or some shit. And he's not there. And like, if you don't hear from him or something like 30 or 40, probably 40 minutes or something like that. Actually, I'll just fucking tell him. I'll send him a text. Yeah, if you're gonna be longer than that, then it's probably not gonna work out tonight. Yeah. It's kind of what I figured. I don't know. So you said that you guys did like, say what's up at some point, just like not like seven or eight or something. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I have sent him a message, but I don't see that message. Like I said, Hey, this is Becky. You know. I didn't give you the number. And if he is on the road, I'm fucking calm. No point no harm in being direct. Yeah, I did. I did end up calling him after like he wasn't responding. Yeah. Oh, I'm so mad. But I'm, I've got some work to finish up on. So I'm just mad at me. No, no, no. I don't think mad is the right word. But yeah, that's a little bit. I get it. I just took a baking soda. Baking soda. Baking soda peroxide bath. And I just got my phone all wet. I gotta rinse off now. Okay. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm still here. I'm like, okay, just doing like work. Like work work right now. I'm on the phone. Yeah, I should be in bed. And it was any other time I would just say fuck it. I was just gonna say fuck it because my friend, I wanted it back out. But if it really is, it's good to be saying this. And if it's the same stuff that's like, that my dude is getting it from, I'm down there paying double that. If it's the same thing that you're getting it from, you're paying double what he gets. Yeah, like, if you get if it's like the same stuff, the same quality or whatever, you know, like, it would be crazy if I could get it that cheap. Because then I could probably still get rid of it. Because people are paying 28, you know? Just so I understand what you said just now clearly, are you saying that you get it, you can get it somewhere cheaper? No, I'm paying double. Like I was paying two, two grand. I couldn't even make anything out of it. I mean, I didn't do it that much. I just did a couple helping a friend out. But that's insane. But if it is the same stuff, I'm gonna just keep telling him it's from the same guy and make him pay two grand. When I can easily probably get 24, just like that guy's getting 28. You know what I mean? We'll see. We'll see what happens. But if he is like the main, you know, supplier guy, like a good chance that it is the same stuff. I don't know. Well, all I can say is the stuff that you're getting is that it comes from like, what I can say is the stuff that you're getting is not from around here. I mean, it's not like made in somebody's garage. It's like made in an industrial size quantity. Like the supplier has like, he said that he told me that he's got like airplane hangers full of it. Like he's got one in Miami, one on the West Coast, and a third place in Kansas City. And those are just the places I know about. Right. Yeah, because I actually, I know someone that wants two of them tomorrow. And that's a different guy, different than the guy that's been fucking around all day. And me and him, like he was short this last run, I had him weigh it out because I mean, it's his deal and whatever. And I just got it for him. And I was like, you weigh it out, you know, you do the work. And he did, but he took all fucking day and I've been waiting for him all day. And so, and my friend was just showing up to pick me up. I told him, I said, you need to hurry up because my ride's here, I got to go. And then he just kept going, like he was just flailing. When I said, I said, hurry, hurry, hurry, you know, and I rushed him. Well, apparently, hurry, hurry, hurry meant short the guy and don't give him his full amount that he paid for. Because apparently the guy was like 130 grams short, like almost like a quarter pound. Like, how do you go? How, how does that even happen? That's ridiculous. Number one. And then number two, it's my fault because I hurried you. That's fucking bullshit, dude. I would have never said, yeah, short him. That would have never came out of my mouth. I would have said, get it fucking done. I was just trying to rush you. It's not my fault you fucking are an idiot. Yeah. Me, I would have made sure everything was fucking, everything was kosher and good and fucking done right. Yeah, that is frustrating. I'm sorry. So I was supposed to get him one. I was supposed to, yeah, get him one tonight. And I was even going to give him a deal because I felt bad for him because he's going to pay for that at 30, 130 missing. I'm like, okay, I could see maybe like an ounce or two, but not, not, not that much. No way. And I watched him weigh it up. I saw it and I had him look at his calculator to see how much, you know, his past, recent, whatever. And if we're calculations are right, so he was like 70 grams short, even though short is short, you know what I mean? But still, like, it's not my fault. Right. I'm just pissed off. Well, hopefully. Honestly, actually, since you said the thing about two tomorrow for another person, I would have mentioned, do I? Yeah. If you get three out of three or more at a time, you get a price. Yeah. Yeah. If you get three out of three or more at a time, you get a price break, but you have to get like three or more at a time. But when you do, it is like, I think it goes down to like, like a thousand dollars per one or like something like that. I can't remember what the price is. A thousand? Would it be $300? How much are we? Because we're paying 13 for a full one. Yeah. That's what you said, right? But if you get three or more at a time, then the price goes down even further. Yeah, I get that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you do have the people that would do that, then I would try to do this. You can fucking swing that sort of shit. I would totally do that because that's even more money. Yeah. Then I would take your money for sure. And also, well, I know, but it's only fair. There is fair. It's not, I don't, I'm not doing this for money. It's not what I wanted from you. I just want you to be happy and successful, but maybe I am putting a little bit too much quality, like customer service or effort and energy into it with you. I don't know. I have some discrepancies that are, that I'm noticing. And I don't know, I don't like the imbalance. Like what? I don't know. Our energies, I don't fucking know. It's messing with my energy, but I'm not seeing the same amount of like respect between you and I. From me? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how to really say it without sounding like, I don't know. I had to like text it and write it down to make it make sense because I don't know. Yeah. But it's not a big deal. I mean, it is a big deal. I just, I'm finding a hard time speaking it in a way that doesn't sound annoying. Not annoying. I like to be professional. I like to be professional. I don't know. I don't know how to not annoying. I like to be professional and it's not about really my feelings. It's just about us matching each other's energy. And I respect. Like I'm not at all. Yeah. I just value, I put a lot of high value on our history, our friendship and wasn't really sure if that was being reciprocated. Right. I can see how you could feel that way. And that's not at all what, or how I want you to feel by all means. That's very kind of you to say that. I don't know what I could do differently to not make, you know, not so you don't feel like that. And, and maybe it's my, my doubting is why you feel that way. And it's hard for me to not trust you per se, because I trust you, obviously, and I trust you with everything, but it's just this game and these people, like, even tonight, that guy was my really good friend. And he literally just called me a freaking pretty much saying I'm sucking dick for rocks, pretty much like, and I wasn't even making anything off of them because it was so expensive already. And, but it just shows you, it's just like how grimy this like people can be. And I'm not at all comparing or saying that you would ever do that. So I could see how that would sound or feel that, you know, maybe my doubting, but it makes me nervous. You know, I finally not, not you, you don't make me nervous. Just this whole like deal does because I don't know the guy. Like, yeah, I know. I wouldn't. And I trust you. Right. I understand you. You're kind of a taking a risk kind of because it's an uncertain. Yeah. It's an unknown. Yeah. I understand that. And it's also kind of like out of, I don't know, a lot of people kind of like, Hey, you want to you want to meet this plug of mine? That's like high value. I don't know. No, I don't think that's very wise in a business sense to share that information with you. Oh, I don't want anything in return from you. It's just like, I want to be able to like support whatever it is that you're doing. Because I feel like that's how I can show you that I care. I care because I'm not able to spend a bunch of time with you. But at the same time, I also don't want like your mental state to like, or like, I don't know, I don't want this happy, healthy Becky to go away. Right. I am in a very good spot right now. And I, I see what you're saying. I most definitely don't want to go back to that either. Yeah, really break my heart. I mean, because I'm doing these things. I'm hoping to see a positive outcome. But I know that the danger lies that it could go very south. Like, I could lose my friends again. Yeah, I would break my heart if I had to be a part of that. Right. Oh, I forgot to text him. Yeah, put some fucking clothes on and stuff. Yeah, I did put clothes on. Oh, yeah, I see you when Oh, yeah, I don't know. I just have a call on the other stuff. 100 bucks to Andover. Do you think I could run to Andover and back before he even gets here? Probably, but I'd hate to miss it. It's so late for me to be out. If you're gonna be out, I might be like, hey, I actually have to run an errand. Can I meet with you somewhere to make this happen? Like right now? And if he doesn't, like respond to that, or something like that, then maybe two birds with one stone would be good. But then again, yeah, well, the rest is also pretty awesome. Right. I'm hoping that I just like, like he really is on his way and I could just meet him because that's more important to me right now. More money anyway, you know. But then I'd feel really dumb and bad if if I waited all this time, and then he never shows. I'm lost out on money. Andover, let's see. That's like 30 minutes from here. Like, and I like to be in bed by midnight. Yeah, you'll never make that. Are you supposed to drop something off? Well, I don't have to. I'll just ask if I wanted to drop a blow off. Which is fine, but it's like $100 worth is really not. I'm making 50. Okay. Yeah. I'm going to try to call him again. So hold on a second. Yeah, I'm going to try to call him again. Okay. I'm going to try to call him again. So hold on a second. Hold on a second. I'm going to delete that number. Okay. Okay. Three, two, one, zero. Oh, my God, that is so fucking... Oh, my God.

Absolutely not. I mean, even in the future, like if something like that did happen, of course, you know, the proper thing is to give everything back. Right. Right. Right. Right. Because he was just telling me, like, I did have, like, kind of a good, like, I'm happy every time I get to talk to Tom. But he was we're catching up a little bit. And he was telling me that, like, this other person that was basically in his role, like, a couple of months ago that I also know his name is White Nate or whatever. Yeah, he was. I guess he ripped off fucking, you know, half a for thirty five pounds. And, you know, basically, he and what he did, it was, like, super shady. He's like, he wasn't answering his phone calls. And, like, basically, like, our fucking records kind of look like you mismanaged it. And but he, like, fucking had a story and he said that a bunch of it was bad and and, like, didn't fucking want to, like, communicate to, like, fix it. So I guess half of it was fucking really pissed off, like, so pissed off. He was like, man, fuck Minnesota. Like, I'm not dealing with anybody out there. But then I hit him up. And then, like, you know, then Tom got out of jail or prison, you know. Tom. Yeah, his name's Tom. That's who we're meeting. Yeah. He's a big guy. He's a big, like, fat guy. I mean, I don't know if that's really the nicest word, but he's he's husky. Yeah. If you happen to be friends with him on Facebook, his Facebook profile doesn't look anything like the way he does in real life. So he doesn't look like a crackhead because I don't need people coming in my house looking like a crackhead. No. I mean, you look like a crackhead, but. You look like a crackhead. I don't know. Yeah, he's a big, hefty guy. I don't know if he looks like he fucking like he's got like that Tommy boy weight, you know. Yeah. Big pun or whatever. I don't know if you want to call it. Yeah. I'm going to have to retell my money, but I'm pretty sure I have that. I for sure have that. If you actually I'm going to put you on a brief hold. I'm going to fucking do a three way call with him. All right. All right. Just don't hang up. Yeah. All right. All right. Sorry. This is full and there is not enough space to live. He didn't answer. He didn't answer. Now he is. Hold on a second.

Tom. Hi. Hi. How's it going? Good. How are you? I'm all right. Yeah. Long day at work or what? Yeah. I just left work. I'm on my way home. Okay. I guess wondering if you just wanted to come over to my apartment. Would be ideal. Yeah, that'll work. Yeah. Another thing is she actually just mentioned that it would be like a lot easier for her to just use. Like she's got the money, her own money. She's going to wait for the other person's money, but I get just easier. So you don't have to wait to go to Rogers or whatever. So if you're actually available, like right now, I guess now would be a good time. If you're. I would have known 20 minutes ago. I got somebody who's stopping over here real quick. I mean, after that. Yeah, absolutely. That's available. Yeah, that's cool. All right. So I give you. Is it okay if I give her give the address to him then? Yeah. Absolutely. Send her phone over.

Do you ever hear me tell, do you hear about that? Sound familiar? Oh yeah, yeah. I think I do. I do remember that. Yeah. He like, basically he was, he fell asleep in a stolen white Dodge Ram. And, uh, like a cop like went to check on him like early as fuck in the morning and like knocked on the windows, spooked him. And he like kind of just panicked. He like started the truck up and just like, like drove in between like a pole and her vehicle and fucking kind of bumped her. Oh, it was a girl. Oh. It was a female cop. Yeah. Like she basically got like clipped by the mirror and like kind of flew back like a foot or two, like into the fence and it kind of bounced right back up. It wasn't as bad as it probably sounds, but yeah, the police, police chase. And then he got away and he abandoned the truck and like a parking lot behind someplace or whatever. And he like got away, but then he, he's like, like a day later or some shit. He's like, oh man, I got to go back. Like I left like all my shit in there and everybody's like, don't go back to that. That'd be dumb as fuck to go back. And he eventually went back and they, they were fucking casing the, like watching it. And when he went in, went like walked up to the truck, they went and fucking nabbed him. And that's how the story ends. This is kind of funny though. I'm glad he is out now. And then he didn't get as long as he probably could have. Wow. That was like two, I think he was gone for like basically like two years. All right. But anyways, that's the quick story. Funny. Too bad. It sounds like I might not be able to see you in this case, but I still miss you and lust for you. And I hope you're doing good. You're funny. Yeah. I'm doing good.

How may I help you, sir? Hey, good morning. This is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Great, and you? I'm doing well. So, the reason I was calling today, I was filing, I was prepared, I think it was like 2022 or 23, and I was filing it, like, late. And I understand in order for me to do that myself, it needs to be submitted by mail. And I don't know if that's accurate because I haven't talked to you guys for a long time, but it's been, I don't know, probably close to four or five months now since I filed it by certified mail, and I never got any notification that you guys received it. And then I checked on the IRS.gov to see if you guys received it by mail. And I'm kind of beginning to think you guys, I might have put the wrong address or something. So, I don't know. I was going to try to follow up with that and maybe get the correct address. Okay. Yeah, let's take a look at your account here. May I have your date of birth, please? 12-15-86. All right. And what's your complete mailing address? 130 Forest Avenue West, Mora, Minnesota, and that is 55051. All right. And then can I just verify your phone number as well while you have me on the line? It's 320-775-9130. All right. Thank you. So, you said about four months ago you filed your federal return. Did you send in your state return as well, or are you just going about your federal return? Yeah, yeah. I filed it together, so yes. Okay. So, the federal return goes to the IRS. The state return goes to the states. Did you send in two separate copies? No, I did not. I don't know. I'm kind of suspicious that the address that I sent it to may have not been the official or the right address, because I think it had me send it to someplace out of state. Okay. Right. So, I mean, I'm not sure where the federal return goes, but I can tell you the state return does not go out of state. It would come to Minnesota. Okay. If you could give me that address. And also, can you confirm that if I am trying to file for a year that's as old as 2023 or 22, it's required to be received by mail, right, if I'm filing myself? No. As long as the software allows you to file online, I don't see any reason why you're not. I don't see a demand to file a letter sent or anything. So, you should be able to file online, yes. And I guess the trick is just finding a place that will file it online without a fee? Exactly. Exactly, yeah. That I can't help you with. Okay. But, yep. And then I can provide you with the address. It is going to be on the form, so you would just send a copy of the 2022 M-1 with the 1040. But I can give you that address still if you'd like. Okay, yeah. Go ahead. All right. That is Minnesota Individual Income Tax. Okay. Mail station 0010. Okay. 600 North Robert Street. All right. And that is in St. Paul, Minnesota. Okay. Zip code 55146. Okay. And that was for the state one? And then do you have the federal one as well? I don't, no. I'm sorry. Oh, really? Not sure where the federal goes here. They don't want to give me an incorrect address. Okay. And also, you said that I can do it. I can submit it electronically through, like, a certified software, but you can't actually recommend, like, a good one to do it, like, for free? Correct, yeah. We can't recommend any software to you, but, yeah, there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to file electronically. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Well, I think that's all I got for today. Are you aware we're missing 23 and 24s as well? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think the last year you got was 21, right, or 22? 21. Yeah. Yep, 2021, yeah, the last one we received. Yep. Yeah, so I don't think I'm going to be filing one. Or maybe it was, yeah, yeah. Basically, I only have the ability to file for two years, and I think it's like 22 and 23 is what I filed for, and I haven't filed one for 24 yet. I don't actually think I'm going to be able to because my income, I didn't have any income. Yeah, I mean, it benefits you to take a look and see if you file. There may be credits that you could qualify for and such. So even if you don't meet the minimum requirements to file, at least take a look and see if you get to file, and if there's a credit it would benefit you, so. Yeah. Okay. Looking at the account, looks like there is what's called other agency debt. Yep. First aid. So any refund would go to that, yeah. Yep, yep, I understand that. Okay. And do you rent or own the home in Mora? Rent. Rent, okay. Did you get a certificate of rent paid by any chance? No, no, I. From your landlord? No, I haven't. Okay. They should be providing you with that. The rentier's credit is actually income tax credit, so you can file that with your 2024 return. Okay. And then, of course, any refund would go to that state tax, but at least I'll pay it off faster. Okay, okay. And, okay, I think that's all I got for now. I know I'm going to be having to call you guys back later on in this, like in like a week or two, to make a payment towards that specific debt on my state capture or whatever, revenue recapture or whatever or something. But I'm not prepared to do that right now, though, so. All right, I just wanted to kind of get the information I needed for submitting those taxes properly, if I was going to do it by mail again. But I think I might just pay a little bit of, pay whatever fee to submit it electronically, so I know that it gets to you guys. Right. Okay. And then, yeah, they just sent a copy of the 1040, and then you can definitely check with the IRS to see if they got your federal return. Okay. And can you provide a phone number for me to call and follow up with them? Yep. Let me know when you're ready for that. All right. Go ahead. All right. 1-800. Yep. 829. Yeah. 1040. Okay. Perfect. All right. Well, thank you. All right. All right. You have a nice day. You're welcome. All right. Bye. Thank you. You too. Any other questions for Ed in or? No, no. I don't think so. I can give you guys a call back if I do. All right. Sounds great. Thanks.

Hello. Hi. So the girls, Ella and Ashton, just summoned me to my room, to my own room, to have a conversation. And they basically were in here without my permission, and my weed pen is on my nightstand, and they're like, Ella's crying, Ashton, they're both telling me how hypocritical I am and that I'm setting such a bad example, and I'm like, listen, for one, I'm an adult, for two, it's legal. They're literally acting like they just caught me shooting up in my room or something. So let me ask you an initial question. You have been without your thyroid medicine for an X amount of time, is that right? No, my antidepressant. Okay. So they can fucking eat a dick, it's none of your business to judge you or ask you questions about what your intentions are, because for one, you're an adult. That's what I told them, but they're like, now you're just not hearing me and blah, blah, blah. And they're acting like... Honestly, I mean, I understand that because of your med situation, had you not had a med issue right now, I would probably be a little judgy too about why you're doing that, what's fucking going on in your life. But I understand, and yeah, honestly, I shut the girls' dad off because I think that they're just way too fucking wild, way too kind of fucking disrespectful, and I don't know, I think they should just fucking have the basics for a while. But to fully implement that plan, that would imply that you should change the pattern of your Wi-Fi and make it so they only get Wi-Fi from the TVs. But yeah, I get it, it's your house, obviously. That conversation did not go well, they both just left, like, stormed out of my room. Good. I mean, fucking, honestly... I told them, I was like, I've told you guys before, I'm like, the problem isn't with you guys smoking weed itself, I'm like, but you guys are kids and you're not, like, you're still developing. I'm like, I'm not doing anything illegal, I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm like, I'm an adult. Like, if when you're an adult, if you choose to do or not to do it, like, that's on you, but yeah. Gabby said something earlier this week, and I'm not like, really fully with it, but Gabby's like, you know, I guess the big thing is like, if their behavior, if they were to like, get straight A's, like, be excelling in all areas of life, like, I wouldn't care if they smoked weed. And that's what she said. But, and I had to kind of like, I don't know, it was kind of just wild to hear somebody say that. I'm like, you would smoke fucking weed with my kids, you would smoke weed with Ashton. She's like, yeah, I'd smoke a fat blunt with her. And I was like, although I don't ever really like, fucking say that anybody should take advice from Gabby, but I don't know, I guess it is worth fucking kind of saying like, honestly, if they were to behave like adults, I would give them more adult fucking, you know, amenities and respects and shit like that. But if they're not fucking like sailing through life, and they're kind of being disrespectful, breaking rules, fucking testing the water, fucking being, I don't know, just honestly, like failing classes doing just, they're not fucking absolutely perfect kids, then I feel like they need to like, be brought back down to like, the Amish lifestyle or humbled a little bit. Yeah. But I don't know, I'm not really hearing a whole bunch of like, yes, I believe the same thing sort of thing on your on your side of the phone, so I'm just gonna shut up for a little bit. No, I mean, honestly, I like I don't completely disagree with that. But it's crazy to me that they just like came in here to like, have like an intervention with me. I mean, kudos to them for like, I mean, approaching you about something that was on their mind. But today, like, I mean, if they like this, except what you just told them just now, that's kind of disrespectful in itself. And I was like, I won't do it around you guys, whatever. And they're like, Well, no, it's just the fact that we even know that you're doing it now. And I'm like, Okay, I'm like, so then in the conversation, I was like, No, if it's this serious to you guys, like, I won't do it. It's not that big of a deal. But then they just got up and walked away. And like, whatever. I'm confused. What happened? Um, fucking Kiana has been smoking, like using a weed pen. Yeah. And I kind of had, like, my weird suspicions, but then I said it out loud, but then she kind of like, when we got back to the house, she's, she like confirmed that I was basically was dry snitching her and not really knowing it. And then she said that the girls found her weed pen and like, if I can give her like the same degree that like, like, you're like, you're no in no position or no sort of role model. I'm saying that I'm a hypocrite about it. And that I'm setting a bad example. Yeah. Yeah. See? Like I said, we're adults, we make money, like, it's us, I'm like, if you were fucking grades, and you were like, fucking valedictorian, valedictorian of your fucking class, maybe you would smoke weed too. Right. Yeah, they didn't. They didn't like my response that I'm an adult, and I'm allowed to do that if I want to, it's legal, blah, blah. And they're, yeah, they're not happy with that. So. I mean, yeah, honestly, I really wouldn't like if you fucking did the whole no wifi thing, because it's gonna like, give, it's gonna incentivize them to like, want to like, be better behavior. And like, because if they, if in their mind, they're like, okay, if we fucking do what mom and dad want, then like, maybe they'll give us the fucking wifi back like normal. And like, honestly, I don't I don't fucking really have any intention of giving it back. I don't think you should either. Yeah. They have a cell phone text and phone numbers. And that's like an essential feature that I'd like them to have. But I mean, flip phones is like, I mean, this is the same concept as a flip phone. It's taking away the data. Right. Yeah. Not even lightning. Yeah. Oh, shit. Sorry. I'm Milo. I just kicked the cat in the face. I'm getting water. No, I'm not. But okay. Whatever. I'm going to bed. But okay. Well, good talk. We'll continue this conversation later. I'm gonna I gotta get ready for bed. I have to get all the kids to school in the morning. I don't want to be up late. your definition of between the two, Brandon. I mean, like, if you were doing something for recreational, it would kind of imply that, like, there's something like you feel is missing in your life that you need to do that. That's not the case. I mean, like, if you were doing something for recreational, it would kind of imply that, like, there's something like you feel is missing in your life that you need to do that. That's not the case. I mean, that's what recreational means. Right, I never said that it was, though you did. You asked me what the difference between the two are. No, I meant, like, how are you differentiating? Because you said it sounds like I am doing it more recreationally. I don't know. I guess I just assumed that you wouldn't be as, like, defensive if it was, it was like, not just that. Defensive to who? The kids? I don't know. No, it was just, like, the way they came out, it was, like, a little crazy. And then they started, like, getting more angry. I'm like, wait, what the fuck? Why are we mad right now? I just didn't think it was that serious, but apparently I'm the worst person ever now. Well, it's not your job to be their friend sometimes. Yeah, I know.

Oh, okay, then we're good, then. Yeah, yeah, as far as that goes. Yeah, her insurance and all that should be good, yeah, and, um, but I think it's, uh, yeah, basically, if you get, once you guys are able to sit down, I know that Cassie's got, like, I was able to meet with her, like, three times a week, basically, and, um, once you guys sit down, and kind of start figuring stuff out, you'll kind of, yeah, it'll be, it'll all come natural, but, okay, yeah, I, so, Cassie, I trust Bella, and you can totally trust her, as well.

Hey, actually, I'm so sorry, before I get off the phone, I wanted to ask you something that I haven't had a chance to yet, but, and, on, in the end of October, were you able to go to your son's birthday party? Yep. And how did that go? Shitty. Oh, it didn't go as well, or it was kind of traumatic? Yes. Oh, man, I'm sorry. Um, my, he, like, he seen me, but, like, I don't know, since my stepdad was standing next to him, he didn't really do anything, but he, it just felt like he, like, looked over me, and, like, you know, just, like, passed me. Yeah. Were you not there? As if, like, he didn't know who I was. Were you not there for very long, or what? I was there the whole time. I mean, except for, I mean, my grandparents and I left a little early, but not, like, a half hour early or whatever, because they were eating and stuff, so, like, we're like, okay, we'll just take off. Oh, really? So you didn't really get to interact with them much at all? Um, no, not really. I mean, he was busy. They were bowling and stuff. Oh, I see. But I was supposed to go as auntie, remember? Right, right. Were you able to, like, kind of talk with your mom and your stepdad a little bit to kind of? No, my mom didn't even see, I don't know, my mom, she was so standoffish, and it was just, it was, the whole thing was just fucked up. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry that it didn't go as well as we had hoped. Um, I don't know, maybe there's an opportunity to, I don't know, get your foot in the door somewhere, like we were discussing, because, I don't know, I know that that's a big deal. Right. Yeah. I hope so. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you a call again sometime soon and kind of check in. But I'll let you guys go on. And I hope you guys enjoy your Sunday. What do you, what do you got going on the rest of this Bella? Um, to be honest, I was like, just trying to reach out to all my people, you know, try to schedule something for next week. That way, I didn't receive services. I'm just like, my brother passed away. So I'm like, just coping with that right now, too. I'm really sorry to hear that. Yeah, it's been like a crazy New Year's, Brendan and Cassandra's just like being whoop. We got to stay in recovery, got to stay positive and feed ourselves. Exactly. And I'm really sorry to hear that. And it just happened like within the last few days or? Yeah, I was actually at a meeting yesterday. And afterwards, my father called me and was like, you know, my father's in out of the country. And he was like, Yeah, your brother passed away. I'm on my way to Minnesota. So got to get ready for burial. We're doing an autopsy to see if he died from substance use. Once we received the autopsy tonight, we should all be over there within the next two days. Yeah. So he was I'm so sorry. Yeah, that's really rough. I'm sorry. I can totally. Yeah, I feel for you. It seems like we lose a lot of people. I've lost two people recently that were I just had to talk to my supervisor about it to kind of get my mind right. Yeah, if there's anything I can do to help, by all means, I'm sorry for your loss. Yeah, definitely. Y'all should kind of just stay in there, you know, my sobriety, stay positive and honor him that way, you know. So yeah, most of my family members, you know, like, it's a taboo in my community. So it's like being a great example to stay in sobriety. Yeah. How long have you been sober now? I've been sober for like about three years now, going on four. Okay. Yeah, mostly on mostly go to like meetings on, you know, do charity work on the weekends. I do like a sobriety bowling on the third Saturday and third Friday. And just like have fun. I try to get myself busy, you know, try to get myself busy. But then again, some self-care too, you know, like, because you can have fun in recovery, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'll be a beacon of hope. Definitely. That's one of the things I love about this job is like some, sometimes like, I can work with somebody and like go fishing at the same time. Like, I haven't actually done that yet. But I plan to. I don't know. Yeah, go. Yeah, I just got a membership at 2218. And like, they have a gym membership gym in there. It's like $15 per month to pledge and have like a membership at the I don't know club. So like I have they have like the pool room you have accessible to the game room. You have access to like on basically the gym just for $15 a month. So I pay for extra $15 to bring some peers up there. So it's really nice. You can really have fun though. Whatever that is to you. Yes, okay. What did you say Cassie? I said I love having fun. You love having fun? I'm kidding her. Well, I'm the CPRS for you then, Cassie. Yes. Are you? Are you in Minneapolis? Yeah. Um, I'm in South Minneapolis. Where are you? North side. North side. Are you familiar with Willard? Willard? Yes, very much so. You can do karaoke on Friday. They do. Yeah, they do karaoke on Friday. Yeah, that'd be awesome. I from what I've known, I've known Cassie for so long. And I would be super amazed if you were able to get her to go out and get out of her shell like that. I'm meeting all the time. But karaoke, that's that's like, No, they just started doing that. I'm serious. They never, I don't think they did that before. Yeah, I did karaoke on New Year's. Yeah, it's a whole new thing. Yeah, I just did karaoke on New Year's. That's crazy. And then generational hope goes wrong every fourth Sunday. Say that again. Generational hope we do a rolling every fourth Sunday now. Every fourth Sunday. Nice. Yeah. What's that place called? Memory Lane. Memory Lane. Okay, I'm gonna put that in my calendar. It's it's at um, it's at okay, so do you know where the Cup Food on Hiawatha is? Yep. It's literally behind the Cup Food on Hiawatha. If you go towards 26th Street, it's that Bowling Palace. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, um, I would like to schedule something with you. When can we meet? Um. Anything? Except for the 9th and 9th, I have Courtney. Okay, so we can meet like tomorrow afternoon. Oh, yeah. Go get a cup of coffee. Are you busy today? Huh? Tuesday? Tuesday works. Okay, yeah, let's do Tuesday. Okay, um, Tuesday, what time works for you? Any time. Any time. Okay, so let's shoot. Are you an early person? Like are you? No, not really. Thank you for your honesty. Um, so let's do like around noon or like noon or 1 p.m. Which one works better for you? Uh, let's go with 1. 1 o'clock. Where would I be picking you up from? Um. That I'm not entirely sure. Usually she's kind of like, uh, like, either Benson Avenue, she, she stays at her grandparents' place. And then, um, the other place she stays is on Broadway, like in Emerson. Yeah, but sorry, I don't know why I'm speaking for her. No, that's okay. We've actually been friends for like, like, I was friends with Cassie before, like, I became a CPRS. And she's actually a big motivation. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's so cool. That's so amazing. Yeah, you're her hope shop. She's like one of, she's like my emotional support person. And because she was really there for me in some of my really low times. So I got, I definitely got a soft spot for her. And we, I don't know, we can kind of be goofy together. Like, I'm like socially awkward, and she's a little socially awkward. And we kind of, we kind of like, I don't know. We just go with it. Yeah. Wherever you want to meet, like we can meet, I can just call you then on Monday at 1pm, 12 o'clock, if that's okay. And you can just send me the address then. Okay, yeah, you mean Tuesday, right? Yeah, Tuesday, Tuesday. I have it on my calendar for January 6. I don't know why I said Monday, Cassie. I don't know. That's okay. Yeah, Tuesday. Yeah, and then we'll go from there. Yeah. Yeah, one of the things I always found helpful is like, if I'm going to get a, if Cass is available, I'll like, I'll message her, like, and or call her, like, when I'm still on the road in the beginning of my day. And like, if she's, like, gonna be, if I'm gonna be able to meet with her, she'll answer the phone. But if she doesn't answer, then I kind of already know that it's not gonna work out. For that day. Yeah, definitely, definitely. I was like, man, let me just call these people, you know, like, because they're just not receiving services. But I appreciate you, Cassie. And Cassandra, I don't know which one you prefer, my bad. Cassandra. Cassie, okay. I'll call you Cassie. And then we can just go from there. And then say, lock my number in. And like, if you need additional support, you're like, hey, man, just utilize me. Because this is what I'm here to do, right? Provide support for you and stop hope, right? Like, hey, Bella, I need this. Can you show up for me? Like, if you need to go, like, go grocery shopping, or you need to go see your doctor, just keep in contact with me. I'm here for you. And I appreciate you. Okay. Hey, one last thing. I was gonna ask, like, just, is it still, do I still have your permission, Cassie? Like, if I have, like, notes or something, can I share those notes with Bella? If it's, like, I mean, basically your business? Yeah, can I send that stuff over to her? Okay. Okay, I just wanted to make sure. Okay, well, I'll let you guys get going and try to enjoy your Sundays. And I'll see you on Tuesday. Thank you, Brandon. Yeah.

You have access to like on basically the gym just for $15 a month. So I pay for extra $15 to bring some peers up there. So it's really nice. You can really have fun though. Whatever that is to you. Yes, okay. What did you say Cassie? I said I love having fun. You love having fun? I'm kidding her. Well, I'm the CPRS for you then, Cassie. Yes. Are you? Are you in Minneapolis? Yeah. Um, I'm in South Minneapolis. Where are you? North side. North side. Are you familiar with Willard? Willard? Yes, very much so. You can do karaoke on Friday. They do. Yeah, they do karaoke on Friday. Yeah, that'd be awesome. I from what I've known, I've known Cassie for so long. And I would be super amazed if you were able to get her to go out and get out of her shell like that. I'm meeting all the time. But karaoke, that's that's like, No, they just started doing that. I'm serious. They never, I don't think they did that before. Yeah, I did karaoke on New Year's. Yeah, it's a whole new thing. Yeah, I just did karaoke on New Year's. That's crazy. And then generational hope goes wrong every fourth Sunday. Say that again. Generational hope we do a rolling every fourth Sunday now. Every fourth Sunday. Nice. Yeah. What's that place called? Memory Lane. Memory Lane. Okay, I'm gonna put that in my calendar. It's it's at um, it's at okay, so do you know where the Cup Food on Hiawatha is? Yep. It's literally behind the Cup Food on Hiawatha. If you go towards 26th Street, it's that Bowling Palace. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, um, I would like to schedule something with you. When can we meet? Um. Anything? Except for the 9th and 9th, I have Courtney. Okay, so we can meet like tomorrow afternoon. Oh, yeah. Go get a cup of coffee. Are you busy today? Huh? Tuesday? Tuesday works. Okay, yeah, let's do Tuesday. Okay, um, Tuesday, what time works for you? Any time. Any time. Okay, so let's shoot. Are you an early person? Like are you? No, not really. Thank you for your honesty. Um, so let's do like around noon or like noon or 1 p.m. Which one works better for you? Uh, let's go with 1. 1 o'clock. Where would I be picking you up from? Um. That I'm not entirely sure. Usually she's kind of like, uh, like, either Benson Avenue, she, she stays at her grandparents' place. And then, um, the other place she stays is on Broadway, like in Emerson. Yeah, but sorry, I don't know why I'm speaking for her. No, that's okay. We've actually been friends for like, like, I was friends with Cassie before, like, I became a CPRS. And she's actually a big motivation. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's so cool. That's so amazing. Yeah, you're her hope shop. She's like one of, she's like my emotional support person. And because she was really there for me in some of my really low times. So I got, I definitely got a soft spot for her. And we, I don't know, we can kind of be goofy together. Like, I'm like socially awkward, and she's a little socially awkward. And we kind of, we kind of like, I don't know. We just go with it. Yeah. Wherever you want to meet, like we can meet, I can just call you then on Monday at 1pm, 12 o'clock, if that's okay. And you can just send me the address then. Okay, yeah, you mean Tuesday, right? Yeah, Tuesday, Tuesday. I have it on my calendar for January 6. I don't know why I said Monday, Cassie. I don't know. That's okay. Yeah, Tuesday. Yeah, and then we'll go from there. Yeah. Yeah, one of the things I always found helpful is like, if I'm going to get a, if Cass is available, I'll like, I'll message her, like, and or call her, like, when I'm still on the road in the beginning of my day. And like, if she's, like, gonna be, if I'm gonna be able to meet with her, she'll answer the phone. But if she doesn't answer, then I kind of already know that it's not gonna work out. For that day. Yeah, definitely, definitely. I was like, man, let me just call these people, you know, like, because they're just not receiving services. But I appreciate you, Cassie. And Cassandra, I don't know which one you prefer, my bad. Cassandra. Cassie, okay. I'll call you Cassie. And then we can just go from there. And then say, lock my number in. And like, if you need additional support, you're like, hey, man, just utilize me. Because this is what I'm here to do, right? Provide support for you and stop hope, right? Like, hey, Bella, I need this. Can you show up for me? Like, if you need to go, like, go grocery shopping, or you need to go see your doctor, just keep in contact with me. I'm here for you. And I appreciate you. Okay. Hey, one last thing. I was gonna ask, like, just, is it still, do I still have your permission, Cassie? Like, if I have, like, notes or something, can I share those notes with Bella? If it's, like, I mean, basically your business? Yeah, can I send that stuff over to her? Okay. Okay, I just wanted to make sure. Okay, well, I'll let you guys get going and try to enjoy your Sundays. And I'll see you on Tuesday. Thank you, Brandon. Yeah.

This is Brandon Gillis. Hey, how you doing? I'm doing okay. Did I catch you at a bad time? This is who? Brandon. We don't talk often, but you sold me a 2007 Chevy GM, Chevy fucking Suburban like, I don't know, like three years ago. Oh, yeah. Hey, how you doing? How are you? How are you? I've been good. Yeah, I've been good. I've been great. I actually just retired the Chevy just recently, unfortunately. Okay, what happened? The training went out, which is typically not a big deal for me because I could just replace it myself. But like, the first training that I got that was supposed to be rebuilt, like, it wasn't actually rebuilt. So I ended up having to get a second one and that one was like messed up. And so I just like, yeah, but my baby mama, my partner or whatever, Gabby, I remember I hit you up a couple months ago, or I don't know, probably close to a year ago when she wanted to get a new car. Right. And she ended up getting a car like, and I wasn't like with her that day. And, and I don't know, I wish we would have gotten with a better choice. But I think that we're actually kind of looking at trading this vehicle in that we have now of hers. And for like, like kind of a more of a third row seat sort of thing, something that's got E85 gas. Okay, what year is the car that you got? What year do I got now? Yeah. This is a 2016 Chevy Trax. Yeah, and it's got 107,000 miles on it. How much does she pay for it? I think she paid 14 for 12 or 14, 13, 13. Thousand, of course. And how much do you want for it? Well, I don't know. I've seen, I don't know. I was looking, we were looking at on car hop. And like, basically the vehicle that we wanted to get in is like, they're trying to sell it like a 2011 or 2013 GMC Denali XL for like 14 or 15 grand. And that's like crazy because, you know, you sold me like that 2008 for like, I don't know, like a little over five or something like that. And I mean, obviously it seems like going through you would be like a way better deal because we're just looking to get like something that's like better than. Right now I have a 2016 GMC Arcadia Denali with 130,000 miles on it. I don't know if you guys are looking to finance, but unfortunately that trade on that tracks, that'll kind of be hard for me because the value of those things you're definitely not going to get. And you're probably in a loan, right? Or say the last part again. Are you guys in a loan with it? Yeah. Yeah, we are. Yeah. She put a bunch of money down towards it. Like how much do you got left on this loan anyways? You know, 5,000. Yeah. So we got a bunch of equity into it already. Are you guys looking to finance again? Yeah. I mean, yeah, basically, like I was explaining to her, it basically would be a trade in this vehicle. And then probably like, um, you know, doing like monthly pay, like still, it'd be like still paying the monthly payment for this vehicle. So, man, then what's that? Um, I would pay that off and sell it out. And this is just me being a good guy, bro. Because if you bring that tracks to me, I'm not going to give you what it's worth. And if you owe 5,000 on it, I would just pay it off and sell it and then get a new loan. Yeah, because if you look at it, like, I will. Sorry, give me one second. Yeah. Thank you. Um, you know, a Yukon and a Denali and an Acadia are two different models, though, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. You said you had a GMC Acadia or a third row. I didn't know. That's what you said. You want a new, a newer Denali, basically. Yeah. Denali or a Chevy or something like that. Or even if I don't, I'm. I don't know. Just based on my experience, like, I'm kind of trying to lean her towards something like that's got E85 and a third row. So, I mean, anything that has those two, like, features is like. Right. So, the Arcadia has the E85 and a third row. It's the new. It's the new. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a 2016. Yeah. Denali. Acadia. Denali. I didn't know that that was a model. That sounded like two different models, but. Yeah. It's GMC Arcadia. It's the Denali version. It's just like. Okay. You know what I'm saying? How much are you trying to get rid of that one for? I can give you a good deal. Probably like. They're going for like 11, 10, 10, 11. I can probably give it to you for like 9, 5 or 8, 9. Somewhere in there. 8, 5, 9, 5. Yeah. Somewhere in there. Going for 11. 11, 12. Yeah. What was the last thing you said? She was saying something. Yeah, they're going for 11, 12. Okay. Going for like 11, 12. Okay. And then. And when. Are you. Are you going to be getting anything new in the next? Like, I don't know 30 or 60 days. If you tell me you want a. Like, I don't know how you guys are financing. But you want, what year do you want? I mean, I mean, we're cool with anything from like 2010 and up. But yeah, mainly like, yeah, those two, those two features, like the third row and like the 85. It's got those two things like we're interested in whatever it is. OK, so if you give me to this week, I can get you one for sure. I mean, preferably, yeah, that'd be nice, but. But and then I know that she, like, so it's the first of the month kind of right now. And towards the middle of the month is when she gets like kind of a bigger paycheck. And if we were going to, I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Because we're at the finance and basically get rid of this vehicle. I don't know how the fuck I know there's like a million ways to do the transaction. I mean, really, like, I don't know if we're working with this company, but. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if there's any other way to do it. But I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Really, like, I don't know if we're working with you. Well, honestly, take, like, your best advice. And let me. Once you do this, send me a van and I'll see how much is worth and what I can do for you. I could do that. I'll text you now. We can go from there. I'm going to hit you tomorrow. All right.

Did you ever get an email from the school saying like, like giving me a schedule or something like that, like a follow up? So, I mean, I remember there was a phone call that took place like, like last week, like a week ago, probably like a little over a week ago now.

It says it's in there like five times. Jesus. Are you reading the description or whatever? I'm reading it. Read it out loud so I know that you're reading it. I just broke my back. Okay, sorry. I'm blocking. Okay, so there's like five of them here. It says Ava school first day at John Marshall High School. And then Ava school first day, John Marshall High School. And then Ava first day, John Marshall High School. And then Ava first day, John Marshall. And you don't have one that has like a big-ass long description? I'm looking at it right now. Well, read that shit. Ava is officially enrolled at John Marshall High School and can begin school on January 5th, 2026. Their student ID is 1034889. We're so excited for you to start this journey with us. We believe that a strong partnership between our school and our families is key to successful enriching educational experience.

Huh, interesting. Huh, that's weird. It's almost like I've seen some like subliminal messaging in that messages. Like, you didn't catch on to that at all? I can't see. I said there was some subliminal messaging in that. You're so funny, you didn't even read it. You just read it out loud and you're like, dads are better, moms suck. Yeah, I know. I knew that wasn't actually in the email and you just put that on there to like say something. Prove a point. Oh, so you did notice that? That's okay, I got the point. Yeah, I was kind of hoping that mom was going to like maybe read it and if she did, she's going to be like, what the fuck? Yeah, Loki, that probably would have been her reaction. Yeah, but um, something that I guess this email, I mean, this thing is helpful. This thing is helpful, but still, I kind of remember them like giving us an actual but I don't think I recorded that because I don't think I was like busy when that phone call happened. Great. Yeah, I don't know, that's all I got for that for now. Really? I figured he would have gotten like some type of email or something. Oh my god, I suppose I mean I could check my email just to kind of see if like something did come through. What's it called? I'll just type your name, maybe that'll come up if something does come up. Google unsubscription. Something, something. You ain't got no chia pet, pussy. I hope Gabby gets that reference. Is Gabby next to you right now? No, no, no, she's not. Yeah, you ain't got no chia pet, pussy. Yes, I'm familiar with that. Yes, I'm familiar with that. 1219. Now this is still just the email. I don't know, maybe if I go into my phone log, my phone log, it will tell me the last time I um, let's see, last time I talked to Kiana. Uh, not going anywhere. Is that just what like goes through your mind? What? Gabby calls you, I'm not going anywhere. Right, yeah. I'm not going nowhere. You guys are telling me Ashton's still asleep. A blue song. I can hear that little baby crying. Yeah, no, it sounds like, uh, it's super hectic out there. Okay, all right, I just went all the way back to my, what? No, what about Ava, maybe I was talking to Ava and that's when the call came through. December 19th, 33 minutes. Well, it didn't transcribe this call, but I don't know, I can look at, wait, other calls, Ella. Uh, I don't know if that's the one. You did not call Ella. I don't know, I can look at, I can like look at one of my phone calls, but I don't know, I can look at, I can like look at one of my phone calls, but I don't know, ask mom, because mom, why doesn't mom know? I think mom knows that we just need to be at the school at like 8 30 tomorrow. Yeah. Right, okay. Yeah, they're all crying and shit. I have no idea what's going on. I should probably go.

Right. Have some decorum, Brandon. She's your supervisor. She's not your friend. Actually, technically, she's not a supervisor anymore. She's just the lead for this area now. Oh. Is it the one chick, the fucking one that you were talking to, and she was telling you her whole life story? No. No, no, no. No, that's her. That lady, that chick that was telling the life story, that's, uh, she's, uh, the program coordinator. Oh, okay. For, like, the entire company, so she, like, actually, I don't know, she's basically, like, one of the most in-charge, I don't know how to put it, she's like the fucking boots on the ground. She, everything goes through her, essentially. Yeah. Okay. But she has the hots for me, I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to see a picture of her? Sure. Here. Hold on. Yeah, I, uh, onboarded this person, and then, uh, he was saying that, um, he's got this, he's got, yeah, he's... Alright, I'm sending that picture to you right now. That's her, that's her company profile picture. I did not know that. Oh, it's cold. Yeah, basically, uh, I spent, like, 15 minutes, essentially, like, 15 minutes onboarding them, because, like, I'm, like, pretty quick at doing it now, and, like, the rest of, and I built, I was, like, on the clock for admin time for, like, a little less than an hour and a half. Yeah. And, um, yeah, most of the time I, we were over at, like, his client's, like, because he does, like, construction work. Uh-huh. He had to do, like, a bunch of, like, touch-up and, like, small repairs at this group home. Yeah. And, um, yeah. So he's, like, yeah, if you want to help me, he's, like, I'll pay you, and I'm, like, you don't got to pay me, but, like, here's the deal, like, I'm going to enroll you, like, today, whether you like it or not, and, uh, you don't have to pay me for any other work that I do to help out. So I was, like, painting and doing some, like, drywall and mudding. Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of bringing some of my construction knowledge to help him in his situation. Yeah. I just realized, fucking, so I ran into one of my old coworkers, Aaron. He, like, stopped by because he was getting his necklace fixed or something, some jewelry fixed across the way from where my table's set up. There's, like, a jewelry store, and he was talking to me, and he stole my pens. What, did you only have, like, one pen? No, I mean, I have, like, my personal pens, but, like, these are the, like, work pens that I leave out on the table so people could fill out those sheets, and I had two on the table, and I just looked at my table, and I'm, like, they're gone. Both of them? Yeah, both of them, and so I just, there was more, so I just pulled out more from the box that we have here, but it just threw me off. I was, like, where the fuck did the pens go? That's fine. But, yeah. I just got the picture of the, your lady looks exactly like I thought she'd look. Yeah? Is that exactly how? Yeah, I was envisioning someone looking like that, and I was, like, dude, I'm going to be so thrown off if she doesn't look like what I think, and then it was exactly what I thought. Dude, actually, I'm kind of curious, and I want to, like, just out of pure funniness, I'm going to... Huh? Just out of pure funniness, I'm going to fucking have Google, like, do a thing, like, Google Photos do, like, one of those remixes or whatever you call it. Yeah. I want to see what she looks like as a cartoon character. Oh, my God, you're weird. Do you think it'd be, like, I don't know... So what are you doing now? Are you just waiting for me now, or are you still working? I'm at a stoplight. I'm following Dagan back to his place to, like, get rid of all the garbage and stuff we loaded into his truck, and I'll probably spend the rest of my time with, like, waiting for you with him. Yeah. Kind of, like, just taking notes and kind of getting, because, like, I'm not allowed to bill for him my time with him, but... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. I need to go to the bathroom again. Yeah. Are you hungry or anything, or...? No, I ate. I had to take a 30-minute unpaid lunch, so I went to the food court and got a burger. Oh, God. Damn, I was expecting you to, like, be off at, like, 3 or something like that. No. No, the mall is from 10 to 6. That's why I said that yesterday, kind of. I was like, we're gonna be gone all day tomorrow. That's why I told them, let's meet up yesterday instead of today, because I knew I wouldn't be off work till, like, 6. So I was like, I'm not trying to meet up, like, 7, 8, and then we're gonna be gone all night. Yeah. Ugh. Look at that. Look at the image that Google created. Yeah. Don't be weird and send that to her. She's gonna be like, why is he fucking doing weird shit with my photo? Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will not do that. That is good advice. Ugh. But yeah. Ugh, I still got two hours. Hopefully something happens in those two hours to make today productive, but I have not really been working. I've been kind of walking away from my station and sitting on my phone. I've gone to the bathroom, like, four times. I got my eyebrows done. Yeah, do you want me to bring Dagon over there so he can apply for, like, fill out one of those... Yeah, does he have a house? Yeah, he has, like, he has, like, a bunch of houses that, like, he has to, like, he's got a client that he's working for, like... No, but he can, like, still get the estimate done and then, like, you know, provide that information to the property owners. Why not? Of course it is. No, it's not. Well, yeah, but you have to own a house. You can't, like, register someone else's house. It has to be your house. You can't register somebody else to have an inspection, even if you're, like, a relative or something like that? No, the only, like, way that that kind of works is, like, let's say you're, like, my mom and, like, you lived in, like, your son's house. Like, if you lived in the house, yeah, sure, I guess, like, you're, like, a relative, like, family member. Like, you could potentially set up an appointment, but... How do they, like, like, screen for that, like, because... Because they call and then they ask. Ask who? The person that they call, like, whoever's on the fucking paper. Okay, so maybe I'll just have him do it for the place that he's actually staying at, this place that we just pulled up to. No, no, it's fine. He lives here. He lives here. Yeah, well, and who is he to the fucking actual owner? Um, well, he's the, I guess you could call him the maintenance guy or the contractor that's doing all the remodeling here, and he's also a tenant. And, uh, yeah. Yeah, no. No, because, yeah, you'd have to, like, put the, like, owner's name. That's weird. Well, I guess we could actually, maybe if you just give me a couple of the slips, I'll have the owners, the property owners actually fill out the slips themselves. That would make sense. As I'm understanding, like, all these properties that Dagan's, like, being, like, hired to work on and fix up, they're all, like, properties that are, like, pretty much being converted into group homes. Like the property that we just, the address that we just left was actually already a group home. And the one that I just pulled up to, which is, like, massive that I was telling you about. They want to make this a group home, but, like, it, like, keeps on failing inspections because, like, the windows and fire alarms and all this stuff needs to be, like, updated and remodeled. Right. Wait, I just realized after you said his name, like, for the third time, is this, like, Breeze Dagan? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah, he knows you too, yeah. He's like, oh, how's it going to be? I was like... Yeah, I know. He was at our house before. I don't remember meeting him. Like, I know that, like... What do you mean you don't remember meeting him? To our house. Huh? Yeah, I mean, like, I remember she brought him over, but, like, I don't know. There's a lot going on. Yeah, I guess. So, he's sober now or what? Um... But, yeah, he's basically as sober as I am. Okay. Yeah, he doesn't, like, run around and do all the hip-dibby stuff, like, you know, whatever. Yeah. Um... Yeah, hold on. I'm going to kind of put your... I'm going to put you in my ear. Dagan! Oh, shit, he went inside. Dagan! I'm going to walk in here. All right. I'll talk to you in a little bit. All right. Don't be late. Yeah. You say you get off at 6, so you want me to be there a little bit before that, obviously. You can be here at, like, 6. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'll still... I can... Basically, I actually didn't clock in right when I got out of the car. And I clocked in, like, 13 minutes late, but I could still clock out, like, at 6, because I have so much time. Like, it's not going to interfere with, like, 6 hours plus 30 minutes. I got you. Okay. I'll talk to you soon, then. Okay, bye.

Hey Brandon, it's Mahad for this Mahad call. Hey Mahad, how are you doing? I'm good, I'm good. I saw your email that you sent me earlier. I was out of the office today, but I definitely saw it and I just wanted to get some context and some updates for you. Okay, cool, cool. Yeah, yeah. So my main thing was, A, I know that you live in Mora, correct? Correct. I spoke with someone on their team, it's kind of, someone in the same kind of similar role as me. It's kind of their community outreach person, I suppose. And it was maybe, what, two weeks ago? And they were telling me about, I don't know if, correct me if I'm wrong, but they have peers that work there currently. That is true, that is accurate. Yeah, they do have like one or two, I think they have like two CPRSs that they keep on staff. Exactly, so my biggest thing was kind of, hey, there's two angles for me to look at it, right? It's A, I would obviously want them to say, hey, once someone gets out of treatment, to make sure that we can go and have the transition over to a CPRS from our team. That's kind of something that I brought up to them about a potential partnership, as well as kind of say, we could reference some of our people that we work with, our partners, et cetera, for treatment, if need be, in the area where we, obviously. You there, okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm there. Sorry, I'm trying to take you off my Bluetooth so I could hear you better, I think. No, that's okay, that's okay. So, yeah, I'm just really just trying to see kind of where that, like, you know, that partnership would fit. They seem, obviously, they seem kind of, you know, interested in it, but it's just the biggest thing that kind of struck out to me was the fact that they already had peers there, so I was like, well, it's not like I can transition peers to work inside the facility, you know? And I immediately was like, okay, Brandon lives in Morris, so that would obviously be a great, you know, thing to do, but I don't know if that's something they would be interested in. Right, yeah, yeah, and honestly, this is all pretty new to me, too. Like, I mean, I've got some, like, entrepreneurial background before getting into this kind of role, so, I mean, I can understand how, like, two companies can kind of, like, partner and work together and have, like, but then there's, like, HIPAA and, you know, all these other things, so I do understand the obstacles and, I don't know, I've heard, because I've had these conversations with, like, my supervisors and, you know, CUDA and just trying to, like, learn and gain more understanding of, like, what these sort of relationships look like, because there's more than one treatment center out in the Mora area. Oh, there's another one? Yeah, yeah, there's one in Pine City called Project Empower, and I have actually had, like, a video conference with them in the past to kind of basically kind of make an assessment if there's anything we could do to, like, help each other on a professional level, and at the time we, I think she explained to me that she had, they also had CPRSs that they hire, and that, I don't know, it was a learning experience, honestly. Right. So, maybe you could explain to me in some other scenarios that, like, we do partner with other companies that, like, what do those memorandum of trust look like, partnerships look like? So, really, so it could be shelters, treatment centers, shelter, I mean, sober houses, all types of different things, right? But the biggest thing, really, that we look for is to be able to provide those peer recovery services in those facilities. If, for example, like, Recovering Hope, there's a situation where they already have peers, the biggest thing that we would, A, target is, hey, those certain peers that work at Recovering Hope aren't going to be able to provide peer recovery services for those folks after they complete treatment. So, the biggest thing for us would be the continuum of care and making sure that those people still have those peer recovery services within their, you know, obviously, something that they can use. Like, those clients can actually have a peer available to them because more of Recovering Hope wouldn't be able to do that, provide that service anymore. Right. So, obviously, that's the biggest thing. That's one. Secondly, really, obviously, I would say, hey, I could always bring up the fact that, hey, this is something that you guys are paying, it's an expense that's coming out of your, obviously, your accounts on a month-to-month basis to pay these peers. We can take over and make sure that you guys don't have that problem. It's not an expense anymore. We can take over. But that's something that people may not be inclined to offer off the bat, and that's more of a trust-based relationship with a treatment center that we already have a connection with. So, that's something that I don't push heavily unless there's already a relationship there. But with that being said, those are the two biggest things. Also, really having a partnership in the sense of, hey, we're offering the ability to bring, we have, we work with well over 300 clients in the state at any moment. So, if there's someone that may need to go back to treatment, someone has a relapse, someone has a person that they wanted to refer for treatment because they wanted to get sober, we would offer that treatment center, hey, when we get these clients, we'll reach out to you so that we can provide these clients to you for treatment services. And that's what a partnership would usually look like. Right. Okay. Yeah, yeah. All right. I'm starting to get a better idea. So, it's kind of parallel in the sense of they're helping us, but we're helping them too, you know? Right. Right. So, I can understand. So, let me run an example. I'm just kind of thinking out loud. So, in the event that you had mentioned earlier that Recovering Hope, they have CPRSs, but once their clients move either out of network or are done with their programming, like their IOP program, then like their services cease. Yep. And so, in a partnership thing, we could be, we could like approach them and offer to assist with clients that are, that already have plans to move outside of their network or plans that are or work with their clients that, you know, are going to be like finishing up with their programming soon. I mean, so that's one possibility of working with another company like that, right? Right. Or what else? Somebody else actually said something when I talked to him the other day. I think it was my supervisor, Miles, mentioned like maybe they have like, they have like a need in their organization where that involves like onboarding people and they would be willing to have us, like a CPR, one of our CPRSs assist with their onboarding processes for them. And I don't know if that's, I mean, it sounds like a thing. Definitely, definitely. But yeah, yeah, so I guess, so it sounds like I'm on the right track. No, you most definitely are. Okay. Yeah, man, I love the idea of being able to partner with other recovery community organizations. And yeah, I'm just very new at it. Right. But you, correct me if I'm wrong, just to clear my, help me get my understanding. How long have you been a peer at Generation Oak? I started, I got hired in June. Fair enough. Yeah, yeah. And this is a career change for me. Like before this, I was a contractor and a realtor and yeah, basically an entrepreneur. I've been an entrepreneur like my whole life, pretty much. Right, right, right. So actually, so what was my last question? Wait, say that again. You had a last question you said? Yeah, yeah. I was just kind of thinking out loud, like what was my last question? Go ahead, take your time, man. So where do you think things should go or like how the conversation should go from when I respond to that email? Because I'm going to follow up with that email that I sent to that LADC. Was it Ann? Was it Ann Thompson? Ann Thompson, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, she hasn't reached back out to you yet, right? No, no, she hasn't. Okay. So once she does, obviously, just really, like I said, I kind of brought up the continuum of care for, how was that? Let me see. Let me see what I said exactly. If I can pull it up. Recover earning hope. Let's see if I can find it. Recover. Let me see if I can just find it in my logs. Three, two, zero, 12, 17, incoming call, nine minutes. Incoming call, 17 seconds. I'm trying to see. Bear with me a second. No problem. Let me see if I can find it in my email. Recovering hope. I don't have it, but what I will say is this. I talked to that other person, that community outreach. I think her name is Christie, if I remember correctly. But I kind of just brought up the continuum of care, and that's what I'd recommend you'd say as well. And also, if they have any questions, really, to go deeper into it, they can always reach out to me. I just don't. I just am kind of someone who's a hard person to get hold of sometimes. So I just saw that from my experience, because I reached out like two or three times. So just be wary of that. But yeah, really, the continuum of care is definitely something I would push. So I'll just go from there. And then I can have that conversation of what we can offer as well as, hey, if there's ever, we see a lot of clients that we work with that might potentially have, like, we see people have relapses and need to go back to treatment. And that's something that we can reference for you guys and refer to you guys in the future within a partnership. Okay. So, you know, one of my co-workers, Rami Strong. Yeah, I don't know. Um, actually, I was just kind of, I've known Rami for a couple of years now. And, but I just was made aware that he's one of my co-workers recently. And then I thought I learned that he actually is kind of specializes in some of these partnerships, like one of these, it was, I forgot the name of the organization, he kind of leads the connection with some sort of church organization. Yeah, something. I'm not sure exactly what the name is, but I know what you're talking about. And, uh, yeah, I guess I haven't connected with him yet, since I've kind of learned that he's a co-worker of mine, but I was kind of interested to hear more about some of his endeavors just so I kind of get a better idea of different sort of connections, like, aside from, like, the one at Recovering Hope. Exactly. But yeah, well, I'm really glad that you reached out right away. And of course, so far, I've gotten a lot out of this convo, and I'm going to follow up. And when I do mention the continuation of CARE. Of course, please do. That'd be good. And if, like I said, if they ever have any questions or anything that's deeper, like they can always reach out to me, they can reach out to Huda. But really, this is like, this is the biggest role that I play in, because I'm big on bringing in partnerships. That's really, like, my biggest thing in working in the organization. So, I spend a lot of time out in different shelters and different facilities, just kind of working with the folks that work in those facilities to kind of bring Generation Hope on into new, you know, new places. Right, right, definitely. Okay, well, I, and is this number that you called from? Is this a good number for me to get a hold of you back? Anytime. It's my personal number, so feel free to reach out to me whenever. Well, obviously, just shoot me a text if you have any questions, context, you know, I'm here for you, man, so. Okay, cool, cool. I super appreciate that. Of course. Okay, well, thank you, Mahad. And hopefully, I'll be hearing, you'll be hearing from me soon. Most definitely, man. I appreciate your call. I appreciate you reaching out to me with that email. Just once again, if there's any kind of context or update you have for me, just feel free to shoot me a text whenever, man. Okay, perfect. I'll do that. All right, brother, you take it easy and enjoy your weekend, okay? All right, you too. Thank you.

Hey good. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. Um, So I was just Are you is now an okay time? Yeah. Yep. Okay. All right, so I was just I was just going through connecting and I seen in the jet all-generation hope cat a Message from a Zach saying only 18 people have filled out the scheduling form every CPR. Yeah, fill out this form today and That is a red flag for me because I know that I have not filled out this form and I was wondering if you just kind of Bring me up to speed like quickly What what it is? Yeah, so it's just a classification form. It's gonna ask you Are you a full-time employee or a part-time employee and you're a part-time and it'll ask you for your Availabilities as far as like morning noon or night Or I think it might even be like in four different four-hour blocks like 8 to 12 12 to 4 4 to 8 8 to 12 And that's just something that we can have on file for the state of Minnesota so when they ask or When they see, you know You know, that's like another tool that we have for the PTO so that then if somebody is asking for full-time Pay for what they usually work that we can say. Oh, yeah. Well you are you know Scheduled, you know for you know Shift every day of this week or or you typically have work. Oh You know four to five days a week for the last, you know, four to eight weeks or whatever and then you would qualify for Certain benefits, you know, I think that also has to do with like Sick time, you know earned family and sick time as well as like this new family leave law Etc. Oh You know, so yeah, so it's not Not to like confuse you or be like a big Big thing It's just kind of like a formality, you know, they want to know You know who they can call on during certain times, right? So if we have like a list of like people that we know would be available Early night or late morning or excuse me? Yeah late night or early morning, you know, then then we'll have like an idea, you know Mm-hmm, so it's not meant to limit you in your hours or capabilities whatsoever. It's not you know Like if you say you don't want to work on a Sunday, but you happen to like, you know Take a call on a Sunday like that's fine, you know So, yeah, all right. All right. Yeah, cuz I was just I I know that with one of my last conversations with a bag was kind of revolving around Getting my fit together and making sure that I have at least my 21 hours or 25 hours and 20 hours, but yeah, yes. Yeah 20 hours, but yeah, yeah Yeah So, okay, so but that doesn't have much to do with this form No, no, no no, so no matter who you are with the company whether you're part-time or full-time the expectation is that you won't get get to and Up to and then keep like a 20 hour average, right? And so the people that are full-time or people that work 40 hours on average, which is very few people That deal with strictly clients, you know as admin have 40 hours because we have Dual roles or multiple roles within the company. Mm-hmm. So it's like a salary thing and it's not hourly But Yeah, I mean, yeah as far as you're concerned, you know, you You know been working towards getting up to that 20 hours this whole time. So we're still here It's important to you in that, you know so Nothing. Nothing changes for you on a day-to-day basis. That's like what you're asking Okay, I got you Okay, all right. All right. Well, I'm just just uh, I'll fill out that that That form real quick. Okay, and I'm just an update I've still got one more client that I'm trying to reach out to this morning this afternoon But I did get just get off the phone with one of them Colette Available client that I had onboarded, you know months ago and I think she kind of like lost my contact information and But I like just got off the phone with her and kind of you know had a great conversation It sounds like every Monday and Tuesday I'm moving forward. I'm gonna meet with her And she's out in this area as well Nice. Yeah. Yeah, so that's a that's a huge plus Yeah, cuz yeah, I'm I don't know I'm like kind of like on the edge of my seat like man I need to get my fucking hours up because like if if I don't a Zach's gonna fucking can me cuz I don't know that last conversation I had with a Zach was kind Of like it was a little dark. I don't know. Yeah Well, I think that there's putting forth your effort and showing up is what's asked of you You know, like we'll eventually get the hang of it and get the follow-through and get the engagement Um, I think it's just you know like I was explaining last week is it's It's not meant to limit you and what you do But but what it's asking you to do what you said you're going to or what was asked of you You know, so as long as you're showing up three times a week in st. Cloud Then you can do what else you want if that makes sense, you know Mm-hmm, like it's a client-led program. We're at their kind of whims as far as like Availability or engagement is concerned, but there still stands to like You know, there's patterns of behavior or or signs of effort on both sides if that makes sense So, you know if there's continuously presented opportunities that aren't followed through on then that's like where the problem lies it's not so much like You know meant to like scare you or definitely not meant to deter you from you know meeting clients or from creating service lines so Okay Yeah Okay, I understand Okay, and you know you telling me about these different people is is good, um And in signs of good progress and good faith Um, it's just a matter of following through on them following through on creating the documentation for that So that then I can point to that and and and advocate for you if that makes sense. Yeah You know Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you, I appreciate that but like as far as that is concerned like you told me the other day Like on monday that you met with the client and I asked you to create the note and when I looked this morning I didn't see it there yet So like that's an example of like even if you're doing the work you have to create the the paper trail or the breadcrumbs for it to like Be real if that makes sense, you know Because I could say hey, well he met him but You know, he didn't do the service line, but then it's like, okay Well, did you why didn't he do the service line? Did you ask him to do the service line? And then why didn't he do it after you asked him? You know what? I mean? It just creates more questions. Oh, so yeah.

Hey Colette, this is Brandon Gillis. How you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing okay. Did I catch you at a bad time? No, no, no, it's fine. Cool. You remember me, don't you? It's okay if you don't. Yeah, I guess I don't. Oh, okay. Well, we met a couple, probably, I don't know, I want to say maybe two or three months back when you were in St. Cloud and came to the Archangels Ministry Building. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think you came in with Craig at the time. Yeah. Yeah. Well, how you been? Um, I could be better. I mean, things aren't going that great. So, yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, no, that's okay. That's okay. I heard that you and Craig may have split up since then. I'm also sorry to hear that. Yeah. Well, I mean, we still keep in contact. I mean, but, um. Yeah. Well, that's good. I know you guys were like super supportive for each other. And, and, but you guys were also kind of like, kind of going through, you know, your, your own, like, kind of, like, recovery. Everybody's kind of, it's hard. Things get really challenging and difficult. Really kind of test those limits. And I can totally understand. Yeah. Yeah. So, I was just giving you a call. I kind of wanted to catch up. And I wanted to, like, see how you're doing. And, you know, kind of see if there's. Yeah, mainly I wanted to see how you're doing. And, yeah. And if it's just that, that's totally cool. But, you know, I would love to hear kind of what you got going on. And maybe I can. So, so I'm thinking about, I know I'm going to be homeless here in, in a very short time. The place I'm staying at, he's selling the house. So I'm going to be homeless. And yeah, things have just been been pretty rough. Yeah. Where is it a halfway house that you're staying at? Or did you find a place to actually rent? Yeah, well, I was, I was going to rent it, but then he ran into some money troubles. So he has to sell his house. So I, I have to move. Oh, I see. I see. Yeah, that's unfortunate. Yeah. How much are you paying there? Is it like a good deal or what? Well, no, I haven't been paying any rent. I've been looking for a job. I haven't had much luck with that. So it's just been setback after setback. And it's just, yeah. So, I mean, he was nice enough to let me stay here, you know, pretty much rent free, because he knew I was looking for a job and, but it just hasn't worked out. Yeah. Are you driving right now too? Well, I don't, I don't have a vehicle, but I do have a valid driver's license. Okay. Yeah. Because I was going to say, I do actually know of a place that's hiring, but I suppose you would need a vehicle to get there. Well, so he's, he's thinking about going to rehab and he might let me use his vehicle while he's in there. Okay. Yeah. Really? That'd be a good opportunity. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because I, I have a valid driver's license. And so, I don't know, he wanted me to go to rehab with him, but I just, I kind of don't, I just want to start a life, you know? Yeah. Go to work, make money, get a place. Yeah, I know. Be like self-sufficient. I totally understand. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I'm tired of being at homeless shelters and like depending on other people. Yeah, I know that can really like kind of take a toll on like, I don't know, your, how you kind of view yourself and how you're feeling, feeling about your goals and everything. Exactly. Well, yeah, I mean, you know, I sit around all day and watch TV. I mean, yeah, I look for jobs, but I mean, that only takes up so much time, you know, so then you have the whole rest of the day and it's like, what do you do with yourself, you know? So, does this gentleman that you're living with, that's getting, that's trying to get into treatment, if you were to start, if you were to get a job someplace, would he like be, like, would he allow you to use his vehicle to get to and from work? Yeah, yeah. I mean, he said, because we were talking about it, because I didn't, I didn't want to go to rehab. I think if I'm just, I can quit drinking on my own. I've been to rehab like three times and it's just being with him and he keeps getting like bottles, you know, but I mean, there's been like weeks where I went without drinking, but then, because he keeps getting bottles and brings it around me, you know, if it's around me, then yeah, I'm gonna give in, you know, I just need to not be around it. I need to have a job for something to do. You know, and, and he said that he was going to give me the, the car and, and some money, you know. Yeah. Well, so I could tell you a little bit about this, this place that I know that's hiring. I don't know if you're familiar with the company at all. It's called RTS and they're located right on Highway 10 and, shit, I forget what county road it's called, but it's like, got like, it's basically in like Becker. It's on Highway 10. It's where that Holiday is. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the area over there at all. But RTS is, is like a manufacturing company. It's where they make gun parts. And I actually have a friend of mine, like an old work colleague of mine from a different company. His wife works there. And I guess like the pay is pretty substantial. Like they start you out at like 18 bucks an hour. And yeah, and it's basically like, from what I've understood, it's like a great, great company to work for. Yeah. I don't know if you need to pass a drug test in order to start. I could find that out. I could find that out. But okay. Just based on like the location, the pay and the, the, the idea that I know that they're hiring right now. Yeah, we could look into that if you're interested in. Oh, really? Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm, I'm somewhat familiar with, with, you know, all that. Yeah. The manufacturing aspect of it. Yeah. I mean, Okay, cool. That's kind of funny. Yeah, no, that's actually really super, really interesting. Yeah. I mean, because in my mind, like when I think about manufacturing, like I think it's like some of it like involves like working with your hands or your fingers and it could be like somewhat labor intensive, but sometimes you're like able to sit down for like the duration of your shift and do it. I don't know, like a lot of it kind of varies. There's so much like variables, but yeah, what you're explaining kind of sounds like that sounds like a good gig. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. So where, so where is this place that you're located at? Like you're living at? Like, is it in St. Cloud or is it just outside or what? No, no. So I am, I'm in St. Cloud. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, yeah, you know, um, yeah. Well, I would, I'd like to be able to meet it with you sometime soon. I apologize the other day. You know, I think I, I called you or I messaged you somewhere in the middle of the night and it was like a wrong number. And because I thought that somebody, there was like, I had gotten some notification about somebody in crisis, and I think I called the wrong Colette. Oh, yes, that's right. Yes, I remember that. Yeah, sorry about that. No, no, no, that's totally fine. Yeah. Well, um, yeah, I mean, actually, if I also if I remember correctly, when we that one time that we did meet, I was able to actually successfully set set up your, your, your stuff for billing so like we can, we can actually work together whenever you want. And, you know, I don't know, pick a pick a day of the week. And that can be like, so usually the people that I work with, like the clients, like I, I like, I let them choose like, you know, I can meet with you, you know, three times a week, and I let you pick the time and, and then like, basically, it's a four hour block. And, you know, all I'll show up, and we'll work together as much as you want. And we just kind of like we identify what your goals are. And we like we work at it together, kind of like I was describing that one day, I'm just like, like, I work for you. I'm like your copilot. And I'm, I'm just here to kind of make sure, like, we're working together and on like, you know, what's this little obstacle or what's this little obstacle or maybe my insurance is is about to lapse, or maybe I need a car or find work. And that's, that's what I help with is. And as much as I don't like to advertise this part, but like, if it comes down to like me giving you a ride someplace or to a food show, like I'm also, I'm also that guy. Okay. Yeah. Although I like to be I like the more cerebral part of this job where I can help you with connect those bigger dots. But yes, if you need a ride to the grocery store, I'm super there for you. Okay. Okay. No, that sounds that sounds great. Did you know that though? Did you know that? No, I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm like, I'm your homie, and I work for you. So it's honestly, I wish I wish that I when I was going through all my shit. I wish that I had somebody that was able to like kind of keep me on track because, you know, you know, for yourself, like, you know, life fucking sucks sometimes. And Oh, yeah, it does. It's hard. Yeah, dude, adulting is terrible, dude. It's fucking terrible. It is. It is. And I don't know, just having somebody like a homie that you know, isn't gonna fucking stab you in the back. And it's gonna like help you keep you on track. And it's gonna like help you meet your goals. That's priceless, priceless. Yeah, yeah, definitely. So, um, you so when I called the my number come up is like, I don't know this person, or did you actually say my number? No, it just came up and I just answered. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, well, definitely definitely save save my number. I can like text you my like my first and my first name and my title or whatever. Just so you can like save it in your phone. Yeah, yeah, definitely do that. And, um, yeah, I guess kind of wherever you want to go from here. If you have a couple of days in mind that you're available that either I could come to you or you can come to me or something in between. Do you have anything available on like Monday because I know I know today's Friday. Um, yeah, I, I do have. I have a tentative thing that I might be doing on Monday but that's super tentative and, but I can I can set aside time on Monday. Okay, or we can do Tuesday too. I mean, I'm not picky. I mean I don't I don't really have a schedule so. Yeah. Or, yeah, or we can do both days whatever's clever. Okay. And, yeah, we would you want to me to come out to where you're at, or would you want to like, like I could pick you up, we'd go to like a coffee shop or I could come over your place, or you can come, I can bring you back to my office, any of those options are out there. It's kind of whatever you're most comfortable with. No, I can, I can meet you at your office. Yeah, are you sure because I know you said the vehicle thing is kind of a obstacle I don't want to know no no I can, I can, I can borrow it. Okay, I'm over there. Yeah. Okay. And, um, um, so on Monday, and then, and then I know you said so just I've been taking notes since we've been talking. Maybe, maybe on Monday or Tuesday, whichever kind of works out best. And, and I don't know if you want to do like, like a soft like set aside that time on Monday, whatever that time is, and then we'll, we'll meet like every week, or. Yeah, maybe Monday, Monday, because in my select the clients that I do have. Why actually I just had to transfer a couple of my clients out to other people, because I was working out in the cities. I was working in the cities like the first half of the week. Oh, okay. And I had like three or four clients, and I would meet, like, I would meet with, like, each of those clients like Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. And so it would be like, you know, every Monday, I meet with that person, Tuesday I meet with that same person, Wednesday I meet with that same person. And, and I just do them like back to back. But, um, um, see, what was I going with that. But yeah, so right around like, uh, yeah anytime for like 11, 11 to like two o'clock is kind of like the best times. Okay. Probably, I could probably actually just maybe around 11. Is that, is that okay with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's plan on that. Okay. Yeah, that works. Oh yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Um, um, so the work thing. Uh, yeah, so on Monday, I could probably plan to meet with you at that time, and then I don't know if we want to like ride together. So about this application, I don't know, I can't remember if it's an online application, or if it's an in person application, but either way, like if it's a if so if it's an, if it's an in person one, then we could meet up, and then we could like drive out there and grab it. And, and, and if it's an online application, we could just do it, like, you know, wherever, wherever it is we're meeting. Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, well do you have any questions for me. Um, no, not right now. I'm not overwhelming you am I. No, no, no, you're fine. Would you even tell me if I was. Yes, I would definitely tell you. Yes. Well, I look forward to working with you and meeting with you again, I really enjoyed the time that we did have in our in my little last, you know, office when we were hanging out. Yeah, yeah, me too. Yeah. Okay, well I look forward to meeting with you again, and I'll give you a call probably like early Monday morning or maybe even Sunday night just to kind of confirm our appointment time.

So about this application, I don't know, I can't remember if it's an online application, or if it's an in person application, but either way, like if it's a if so if it's an, if it's an in person one, then we could meet up, and then we could like drive out there and grab it. And, and, and if it's an online application, we could just do it, like, you know, wherever, wherever it is we're meeting. Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, well do you have any questions for me.

Hey, good. How are you doing, Brandon? Okay. Um, that was tricky. For some reason, I couldn't just click on it. I had to like download another app to be able to play it. Um, yeah. So were you just asking who that person was or what you should say to them? Yeah. Um, cause they, okay. Yeah. So that, so his name is Mahad. He, he deals with outreach with different programs. And so he is the person, um, that is in charge of like establishing and then, um, continuing those connections. If that makes sense, like on an official level, which is what that MOU process is and stands for. Um, and so, yeah, I mean, he's accessible. I could go see if he's in his office right now. Um, or if you have like a specific question, I guess, I'm not really sure about, uh, um, you know, where the conversation was taken after that clip was, you know? Okay. Um, so I guess, uh, this is in relation to that, that email, uh, that you and I were working on. I actually, I thought that I swear to God, I thought that I had sent it already, but as I was looking today, I was like, oh my gosh, it's still in my dress. That's embarrassing. So I actually, um, I had Heidi look at it real quick and she helped me make one last change on it. And, uh, and then I was reviewing the conversation with Huda, you know, with that phone conversation and she said that, and I was looking in the directory on connect team and I couldn't find like a Mahad in our, in our directory. So I was like, damn, if I'm going to CC the, like somebody besides you, because I did see like a blind copied you in that email. So you have a forward to that email. Um, also, uh, you know, blind copy, uh, this Mahad person, but I didn't know their contact information. Yeah, sure. Um, here, let me find it for you. Um, give me one moment. Cause I don't know if I can speak while you're looking for that, but on top of Lacey, well, thank you for that. Um, it was also mentioning that there's a female, um, she gave me her, her client number, but I don't know her name off the top of my head, um, transferring from some other place, uh, to, uh, okay. Her client ID is 2206, uh, she's transferring from, uh, someplace else, uh, to, and it's going to do like an inpatient, uh, recovering hope. And so if that's the case, like, um, I don't know, I just figured it was going to be kind of like kind of building on this communication between me and recovering hope and our organization. Yep. Yeah, absolutely. That's a perfect segue. That's like a, definitely a natural, um, starting point and, you know, from that interaction, you'll definitely build, build traction, build trust, you know, build ease. Um, you know, I'm really glad that that will, will, will work out. Um, do you know when that client is being transferred there? Um, um, she needs transportation on Monday, uh, yeah, potentially it'll be on Monday. Okay. Um, and is, is this client without a phone or have you made contact with her? Um, or were you just contacted or like notified from Lacey? Lacey did tell me that she doesn't have a phone. Okay. That's what I thought. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. That is good. Um, good to know. Uh, so were you made aware about the client 1173? Um, just before I got on the phone with you, I seen that started between you, me and Lacey and the information about that at this time, what, what, what could you tell me more about that? Yeah. Um, so I guess he met with, uh, one of our peers named John the last, the past two days and that he no longer wants to go to St. Cloud and that he wants to quote, face his problems and not run from them. Um, she said that she suspects the same pattern of events in a couple of weeks, um, and just wanted to let us know, um, let me pull up what she sent me personally yesterday. Um, yeah, this is, this is a job person. So yeah. Yup. Yup. So she said this client's in full blown psychosis. He was evicted from a sober housing. He goes to treatment and the next day for intake, he cancels and he's chronically using. She said that he has schizophrenia and other mental health conditions along with the psychosis and that he's hearing and seeing, believing things that are not accurate. Um, so with that being said, it was, uh, I mean, I don't know, I guess in ongoing developing situation, as they say, you know, um, if for some reason he, he does have the intention and actual follow through, uh, to move, then by all means, I, you know, I think supporting him, you know, in any way you can is helpful. You know, I do think in some ways that while you're getting back, back started and back on track, like, you know, on a personal level, like not having to deal with that situation right now might be a blessing. Um, you know, and that there, there's also a blessing that there's a peer and a team of peers down there, whereas, you know, up there it would kind of potentially fall on your lap, whether directly or indirectly or consciously or subconsciously, um, you know, so, but just to update you on that, yeah, that he's right now going to be staying where he's at. Um, and if I hear something, I'll, I'll, I'll reach out to let you know, I'm sure Lacey will already probably be on top of reaching out to, you know, as well. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me, I think that 22 or six would probably be a better, um, better fit, I guess for right now, you know, and seeing as she would be like right there and in Laura, that would help on you, you know, for, um, you know, ease of access purposes. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. About the person. Yeah, I, I, that's the person I talked with you about, uh, over the last couple of days and I'm kind of like glad cause at some point I remember I, I tried to three way call Lacey with him on the phone and I didn't get through, but then she called me and she's like, yeah, John Gertz. And then she's like, kind of, you know, that'd be what she just told you that he's kind of in a psychosis right now and that he's, well, she didn't, she didn't use the word nuisance at all, but like me summarizing, um, you know, it's, it's been a little bit of a struggle with him getting into treatment and setting it up and then the last on the day of he'll like back out. So yeah, I can see if they're, if they're willing to, if they're able to make things work down there for him, that's, that's fantastic. I would like to see him successful wherever he goes and you're absolutely right. It may be a blessing in disguise for myself. Um, but the, so the two, two Oh six, um, and then, um, also reaching out to this Mohammed person, uh, so we're going to like, uh, like take a forward, the email that I just sent that forwarded you, I like forward him a version of it, like the, what I sent. So as like a little bit of a story or whatever, and then, um, and then I'll also in the email that I send them on Mohammed, I'll also add into that email, I, okay. We also have an additional client that's going to be transferring to recover and hope doing either an IOP or an inpatient program. And I just want to keep you in the loop, you know, just kind of give them just that little email. So that's, would you, would you concur to that as the correct? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Cool. I'm going to shut my door for a second and take you up to your phone. Okay. Dude. Um, I got a, so, uh, a little bit slightly not work-related, um, I was gonna, I was gonna ask you, cause you know, I, I super respect you as like where you're at in your recovery and there's like, you as a person and all that shit. And I don't know, I'm just going to like ask you, so like over the last two weeks I had and I don't fucking want to keep on banging this drum saying this shit, but like I had another like two, uh, close people of mine pass away and one was a suicide. And then the other was actually somebody I went to treatment with and they like, you know, as far as I know, they were doing really well. And then they had like, you know, like a one-time relapse and that relapse led to their untimely demise. And yeah, no, it's, I mean, um, I dunno, I just assume like, I dunno, I kind of feel like, I dunno, you, you, so you have been, you've obviously experienced the same thing I'm going through because like, it's like a common thing, but I dunno, I was just kind of hoping to hear your insight on it. Maybe like, I dunno if you got some like positive feedback or something like that I could like work with, cause it is kind of bothering me a little bit. Yeah, it's tragic. Any, anytime anybody dies, um, you know, I had to attend my best friend from high school, his funeral three weeks ago, um, fuck me, dude, that's so hard. Listen, his body was found half at another high school friend's house and half at a park. And so there was like six months since he was missing for two years. And then after they found his body at the park and then at the house, then they still haven't released it because of, uh, the investigation. Um, so, you know, that was tragic. He was one of the people that, um, you know, I hope to one day be able to bring back into the fold, you know, like he had struggled with his addiction, his addiction, his whole life. And, uh, you know, just when he went to prison, it kind of broke his spirit, you know, and when he got out, he wasn't saying, um, and, you know, he, he died, I'm assuming homeless on the street for a long time. You know, I want to say by choice, but he had a loving family, um, you know, so he was like probably like the seventh or eighth person I know that died from addiction. Um, you know, some people, like you said, they get clean for a little bit and you feel like there's hope and then something happens and they slipped at one time and, you know, they can't come back from that. Um, what I know that, you know, every time I think about them, I think about the decisions that I make on a daily basis that keep me away from that, you know, um, and it reinforces my own recovery and my own, you know, um, gratitude for life in general, you know, and the fact that I'm still here and that, you know, it's my mission to pay it forward every chance I get, um, you know, because everybody deserves a chance at life, you know, but we're also not the ones that like make the decisions that take them away. Right. Cause if it were up to us, we would save everybody, you know, um, Fuck man, damn, that's really sad. I'm really sorry to hear that, dude. That makes me sad hearing that what you, what you experienced and that shit really sucks. That's definitely a fuck. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, again, like we're, we're here, we're, we're alive, we're healthy, you know, we have families that depend on us that are the motivation, you know, to make the world a better place. Right. So, um, you know, we can, we can continue to do all the good work in the world, um, you know, in their memory, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I suppose that is the, that is the, probably the good, the good, uh, positive energy that, that I needed to hear, you know, like to try to convert this to like ammunition to continue to do the good that we're doing in this, in this role. Absolutely. I mean, that's kind of like this, like the, the ethos behind our job, right. We're able to take the pain and the negativity and the hurt that we've, you know, caused on ourselves and our loved ones in society, and then be able to like, learn the lesson from that, extract the positivity, and then only put that out, you know, um, in a ripple effect, you know? So hopefully we're planting seeds out here with, you know, our actions and our words that continue to, you know, benefit society in ways that we'll never know the true effect of, but. Yeah. We know that we're trying, you know, um, you know, and as far as that goes, like trying to like, again, like support our loved ones and, you know, teach them the lessons that we wish we knew, you know, teach our clients through our own experience and relating that like, you know, and showing them how to navigate through these situations and, because they do happen, you know, like, especially in recovery, you know, in long-term recovery, yes, people will die, you know, loved ones will die, um, you know, every situation is different, every relationship is different, you know, um, and everybody's relationship with death is different. So these are all like super ambiguous terms and things that, you know, probably until the day we die, we won't know exactly what's up with death or, you know, our relationship with it will change, you know. Yeah. So. Damn. I, I, I claim to be no expert, you know. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I don't think I've ever asked you this, but are you a veteran? No, no. Oh, okay. Yeah. You just used some terminology a minute ago that I was like, damn, dude, maybe, all right. But yeah, that's okay. Okay. Damn. Well, thank you, man. Fuckin. Yeah. I don't know, man. I got your back, dude. Like whether it's work or fuckin life or due to. I got your back too, Brandon. I got your back too, man. Yeah. For sure. I appreciate that, dude. Thank you. All right. I'm going to try to get back to work and I'm going to be productive yet today. And, uh. Oh, last question. Last question. Um, and I, I assume, so I don't really know the office etiquette for this and I assume that like Huda doesn't need to be like, like filled in on every piece of like, you know, literature that goes through this organization. But like when I email Mohammed, should I, uh, CC her? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. That'd be perfect. Yeah. No. No, I, uh, I think that anytime, you know, you are at that crossroad, just go ahead and send it to her because it's not, uh, you know, it's no sweat off her back. I think just keeping her updated or having, you know, giving her the option to, to stay on top of the situation as it developed is a good thing, you know? So. I got you. Cool. Yeah. Yep. And then also CC, also like CCU as well. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Keeping, keeping me updated is good. I, I, I think keeping her updated would be also just as important, you know? Yeah. I just wasn't sure like what the protocol, like if it's like overkill or if that's an appropriate behavior. Nope. Yeah. No. Something like that. You know, if, if it was related to any like single given like service line, of course that would be like an enormous or gargantuan task, but she's the program manager. So everything is technically under her purview, you know, especially something new would just be good to keep her, you know, aware and abreast of. Got you. All right. Yeah, for sure. Yep. Thank you for asking though. Yeah. All right, man. All right. You got a busy day today or what? No, not really. I mean, just catching up on some supervisions. Sometimes people wait until the end of the week. But other than that, I don't have a whole lot planned. So just taking it easy, I guess. Okay. I got you. Oh, and this, does this qualify? Should this be our supervision thing? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Do I clock in for this? For our supervision for the week. So. I clock in for this. Is that correct? Yeah. Proper line to phone call has been. Yep. So we're at like 20 minutes. It's 1145 and just, you know, you can backdate your clock to like 1125. That's what I'm going to write down that we started. Okay. Copy. Yeah. All right. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you. If I have anything else, I'll reach out and I'll try to limit. So I don't call you fucking 10 times today, but. Don't worry about it. Feel free to reach out. I'm here to support you. All right, man. Thank you. I appreciate it. I hope you have a nice day. You're welcome. Yes, sir. You too. Have a good weekend. All right. You too.

Yeah, Ava, I need you to kind of look at mom's calendar if you could real quick and kind of help us determine a time that you guys can go in there on Monday. She has to get up. I know, I'm sorry. It's all good. Mm-hmm. Would some time around here see that working? Just find mom. What? I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you say, Ava. I'm next to mom now. Oh, okay, perfect. Could you put her on the phone then or let her know what time we're looking for works? He's on the call with the guidance counselor at John Marshall. I must be letting you know when it works. That's not going to work right now. Not right now, on Monday. Monday the 5th? I don't care when Ava works. Anytime before tomorrow, anytime during the day before at 4, except for tomorrow, I work double. Okay, the counselors are actually off for two weeks break. So would Monday morning the 5th, like 8.30 work? Would that be okay? Yeah, that would work. Okay, we can do that. And then just checking, do you know, are you within the busing zone? I do not know that right now. I know that for the middle school, we're not within the busing zone. Okay, they don't automatically assign bus routes for older students, but I can give you a phone number if you'd like to call and check to see if Ava would qualify for transportation. I'm probably just going to drive her because I already dropped the other two off, so I can just drop her off after that. Oh, sure. I mean, that's fine. If that works, that would be all good. So we'll plan on 8.30 Monday morning the 5th then, if that works for you. Sounds good. Okay, sure. And then just park in the visitors parking lot closest to the main entrance of the school, door one, the flagpole circle drive entrance there. There will be someone at the door to greet you and direct you down the hall to the counseling office, okay? Okay, sounds good. Okay, wonderful. Thanks so much. Have a great holiday break. Take care.

It's not like it's packed there. Yeah. Um, I am just passing Cambridge. I'm passing that quick trip. Oh, man. So, like, another 15, 20 minutes. Damn. I think. In that case, I don't think I have a choice. I think I have to go in there and sit down. Oh, you were just, like, outside? Do you have your stuff with you? Yeah. Well, I mean, it's just sitting. Yeah. I wasn't really sure how far away you were. Yeah. I was finishing up my paper and writing two responses. So now I'm done praying that fucking it doesn't have too much AI. 25 minutes.

So I figured whoever drove you was with you. Yeah. Phoenix. Oh, damn it. I wanted to see her baby. Okay. I do have my wallet. Okay. Okay. Huh? Yeah, I got all my stuff. Okay. I was going to say, I mean, I wouldn't want to, but. If it means seeing that baby, I would go back to her place. Yeah. I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'm not sure if I'm going to have time for the baby. And. Yeah, it's like wherever. It's not like. Where they're at. Like her uncles. Yeah. That way you had to leave so early. Oh, no. I mean, Honestly, if I. I don't know if I was going to be down there if I wasn't going to be. Yeah. Right. Not what I wanted to do. Right. All right. I wonder what I should do with my bag. Yeah, I think it's fine. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What if someone steals it? He's going to steal my shit in the parking. Yeah, they would. I suppose. It's a bar. People are drunk and they're like, oh, a free bag. Cool. Hold on a second. I don't know, but I. You're supposed to be getting it back right away, but I guess I'm not getting it back until tomorrow. And you can blame that on Johnny. You borrowed money to Johnny. What do you mean? Yeah. Johnny's Johnny's paying me back. Yeah. I don't really want to overcomplicate it. Yeah. It's not your money to under complicate it. What? I said, it's not your money to under complicate it. I mean, what is money anyways? Isn't there? Aren't they just like federal notes or something or IOUs, but I don't like a federal scale. I suppose. I mean, right now, the way I'm spending it, it is. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Alice awake. No, he's asleep. I thought you were like kind of coming down towards the cities earlier. I don't know. I think I looked somewhere. No, when you called me and video called me earlier today, you were driving. I thought you were said you were in Cambridge or something. No, I just picked up the boys. I was that quick trip, but I did go to Cambridge earlier to take my test. Oh, for school. And it's a last thing for school. You got to do for a while. Yeah, kind of. I mean, I next semester. I mean, I'm going to do my practicum and a statistics class, but statistics is also online. So, I mean, unless I need to take exams in person again, like it's going to be like the math class I just took, but statistics. Like mostly online test in person. Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully I can get my practicum going and stuff. Which consists, you just basically need to get hired and start putting an hour someplace. I already got hired at recovering. So, so then technically you already have started aside from putting in hours. Yeah, I guess I just, I wasn't like they said. So basically the way that it went was I went to court for my thing. I went to my interview. For like, I went to court, I got that submitted, whatever. I did my interview with recovering hope and I had to let them know, like, I have to wait for that to clear itself. And they're like, okay, cool. And then they emailed me like, Hey, we would love to have you. Like basically you're hired, but like what, so what's going on with your court thing. And then like, I was like, you know, like, I might have to, like, I would like to start like as soon as possible if you guys have openings, but like, if that's not the case, then I guess I'll start in the summer. And then I was starting to like make plans to do it for the summer. But then my attorney called me and said that I could, that I got that shit all turned around. So then I talked to them and was like, Hey, like, can I start it sooner? Like I got that stuff cleared up. And so I'm in that middle process where they're like, they said like, Oh, that's cool. Okay. Like we'll work on that. And, but they haven't confirmed like, yes, you can start next semester. So, yeah, I understand how that works. You need to basically submit like for your license or your like pre license or whatever. This is my practicum. That's like if I were to get a job job after school, this is like, this is technically still school, but it's on, on job training. So it's a class that I'm taking, but it's called practicum and it's literally just work. Yeah. Did you get a drink? No, I don't want to socialize with anybody. It looks like you're pretty close now. Yeah. I'm on 237th Avenue. You want to like stare at your phone or do you want to keep on the phone with me? I was looking at my map. No, you're okay. I just didn't know if you felt awkward, like you wanted to stay on the phone with me or if you wanted to hang your phone. No, I'm not going to get raped or anything. I can get. Are you okay?

And so I'm also waiting on the Rosenberg center to send us the stuff so I can send it to everyone. And my teacher or the lady, she seemed pretty confident that I'll probably get a B on it.

I bought a bunch of gifts last night and I got a few like, I got some stocking stuffers, but I only got stockings for the boys because I don't know, I need to go to school.

And that's supposed to be coming I think tomorrow or Thursday. And then one of your guests is supposed to be here before Christmas but your other gift isn't going to be here so like the 29th so Yeah, you're only getting two gifts for me because they're expensive gifts. One of them I didn't have to spend any money though because but I used all my fucking points at work. Because at work we get like, basically like it's like, it's like so that they don't have to give us like cash bonuses but basically you could buy stuff for free. And I had like 22,000 points which is like 200 points really because I think 1000 points is like $10. Yeah. And so I got you something for like 20 20,000 points. Cool. Yeah. But yeah, I think on Sunday, Kiana said that we'll go to like go shopping really quick and get some like stocking stuffers and like the last bits and ends of the kids gifts and stuff. And then I think we should be good. And I still I need I got my brother a gift. I got Ricky a gift. I got my mom something and my sister something but like I need to get them like a few more things because like what I got them wasn't like big or anything. And so I just got him I like looked up like canoeing essentials. Can you hear me? Yeah. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Oh, I looked up canoeing essentials. And like basically it was like one of these like pads for your butt or something to sit on while you're in the canoe. And then a bag. And I was like, Oh, that's cool. I didn't know what to get Ricky.

Not spending $300 on your gift. Yeah. And then she just said, like, clothes or skin stuff. I don't even know. But I don't know. I'll try to find something. I've got to make like, two more phone calls before Johnny gets here. So hold on a second. All right. Well, don't be too fucking weird when you get back. Your face already looks weird. Okay. Nice to see you and talk to you too. Well, don't get offended at me. Like, you know, you shouldn't be doing drugs. Okay. All right. Bye. Be safe. Make good choices. Don't go to jail. Say bye.

Not spending $300 on your gift. Yeah. And then she just said, like, clothes or skin stuff. I don't even know. But I don't know. I'll try to find something.

What's up, Brandon? Oh, not too much. Just kind of being productive and yeah. How are you? How are things going with you? Oh, it's going. I've had a couple little run-ins but I'm alright. Uh my headlight went out. I ended up putting that in myself. Yeah, on the passenger side but uh I'm gonna have to uh I gotta take this up to Valvoline Friday and uh get an oil change and uh I should have did it before it got caught. I just didn't have the money, right? Mm hmm. But uh I was wondering how much would you charge me to do uh my uh you remember I told you about the portable GPS I got with the backup camera. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, how much you would you charge me to uh hook that up for me? Okay, I remember I put it in. So, 1 second. So, for the wired backup camera, uh that's two to 3 hours maximum uh time that two to 3 hours it would take maximum and it's $170 labor and um yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's it's actually pretty pretty good cuz I'm considering like all the the wiring stuff that we put on there and yeah. But you would do it right, right? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, it would be it's it's done correctly. It's done like the way like that standard. Yeah. Well, II need a couple of weeks here and then I'm gonna give you a call cuz I definitely don't need that. The seat on the other hand, the part alone costs like 140. That's gonna take me a minute. Um I thought that the the part that you needed was uh only uh sixty uh 72 bucks. Oh, I thought it was 140. For the last power seat switch. Yeah. Yeah, it says seventy-two unless um unless there's a wrong part or something different part, but I'm pretty sure that's the one. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna do the uh yeah, I need that camera set up. Yeah. Yeah. How much do they charge you to do the oil change at Valvoline? How much do they charge you to do the the oil change up uh on Friday? I don't even know II think I've seen a price check. I think it was fifty some something like that. Yeah. The change of oil. Uh I'm gonna give him a call. So I'm gonna show him as high as 100 and some. Yeah, usually they charge pretty **** high. Um we could do it. Um if you just buy the the oil and the filter, if you get it from Napa, you get the filter for free but the oil is like thirty-five bucks and uh yeah, that can that'll give you some relief. You say what now? Instead of paying them uh uh Valvoline 100 bucks and we could just do it for you tonight and all you just got all you gotta do is pick up the oil in the in the filter from the Napa. Yeah, I don't get paid till Friday though. Oh, that's right. You said that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Well, you got the address that you're not you're not a very good texter. Huh? Well, all this stuff is new to me, man. I've 20 years, man. So, yeah. I'd rather just talk to people myself. I totally feel you. I I I kinda got that idea. The text message I was sending weren't really doing it for you. So, yeah, yeah, no problem but yeah, um I I'm actually gonna be in town uh all week. I I usually live out of town but because I'm having some car troubles myself. Uh I'm actually just staying uh like, you know, local and we're working with some other people that are in the area. So, um on Friday, um yeah, assuming you get off work about the same time, 330. Uh I get out around three, three thirty. Depends on how much work we have to do. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you can, if you work it out, um yeah, uh I'll I'll send you that address to you uh another time just so you know what it what it is um but on Friday, if you wanna give me a call sometime before you're off of work just to make sure like there's a spot for you and then come up there where you can do the yeah the the the backup camera, the oil change, and uh and uh I mean, actually so I'm now that I'm thinking about it, if it's like Friday and I can, I can probably find either myself or somebody else go and get that part, that replacement part, like for my um I used part part and that way it'd be basically, I don't know, I don't even know how much they would send, sell it for, maybe like twenty or thirty bucks. Mm hmm. Cuz if it works, it works and if um yeah, it gets you out of having to spend seventy-five bucks. Well, like I said, give me a couple of weeks and uh I'm definitely gonna, I definitely want you to do this stuff for me. It's just, I got to be able to uh sort the money and pay the rest of these bills too. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I missed your call a couple weeks ago. **** I was not in a good spot. My that my truck went out. Yeah, I called uh my daughter's car problem. Uh the battery went bad, right? Oh, I was trying to find her another battery. Yeah, you end up getting her sorted out, getting her. Yeah, she ended up getting the battery and stuff. So, that's all her problem. Yeah, that's good. I didn't want her to be without a car in the winter. Yeah, of course. And then we had that freezing biting cold. So, that definitely one of the good things to have your car not run. Yeah, I know. Yeah, my my transmission went out on my truck and uh I've I've replaced it with uh what I thought was a good transmission and turns out it was not. I I was lied to whoever who I bought that from. Why? And uh so I had to go buy a second transmission and put that one in and what what happened with that? Uh no, actually, it was just the one transmission I put in. It was bad. Well, when I get on the other side of maintenance of this vehicle, I'm going to have to do some other things for me. Uh you know, I want some cognitive stuff done. I want to uh automatic cue start. I mean uh car start. I want a car alarm put in there. Okay. You don't already have it. Huh? It already has it, doesn't it? No. You're so you don't have it. So, you got a key fob though. Huh? You got you got a key fob though, right? Like uh oh yeah, I got a key fob. Because um I mean if you if you maybe you're right but like I myself, I actually didn't even know how to use my my my auto start remote start until somebody else like showed me and even uh but uh it's like uh I'll I'll look it up real quick and maybe I'm wrong and you don't have it but uh you gotta keep in mind this is 2012. So, Chevy or GMC? No, it's the GMC 2012. Uh Yukon XL. Okay. Press the lock button on your key fob then immediately press and hold the circular arrow button for two to 4 seconds until the lights flash and the engine starts. Oh, it actually do have one? Yeah. I'll I'll I'll **** I'll copy and paste this thing and and you're going to have to look at the text message. But I believe in you. I think you can do it. I think you can do it. Hey, so you're saying that this is was that the auto start or is it? Remote start. So, you can start it from inside the house, right? Yeah. Yeah. It'll it'll stay running for like 10 minutes and then it'll like shut off. Okay. I didn't even know that. Yeah. I really didn't know that. And that's what you were asking about, right? Yeah because I was going to, I was going to put the automatic start in there and then I was going to put the uh the car alarm in there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Car alarms are. What's your name again? My name. You done working? No. That's yours. No, I said, are you done working? Is this yours? Oh, you just show out in front of company, huh? I see what you're doing. I see what you're doing. Go ahead. Yeah, I was looking at this uh this avalanche, man. I like it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got a thing for cars, man. It's uh I I I get sick with it. You and you like the avalanche? I mean, I like the avalanche because it like looks a lot like uh you know, my truck but II **** I love the extra passenger room and all that. I mean, to me, that's just super luxurious. I love it. Yeah, I like a little little you gotta like a little like a little short body bed in the back. Mm hmm. Yeah, I I like this. I like this. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I like this. He purr like a kitten too. Uh huh. He purring like he want me to drive it. That's it's purring like he want me to drive it. Yeah, it's really doing it. See but but since you got Packers on the car, I ain't gonna probably gonna be able to do it. I'm gonna have to pay it. So, Alright, man. Take it easy. Uh yeah. Yeah. See, once I get that, see, the the thing of it is is that the backup camera I got is in my my my rear view mirror, right? Mm hmm. And it seemed like I got a whole lot of room I really don't have, right? Yeah. That's how it shows, right? Right. And uh I can be up on the bumper and then it still tell me I got all this space, right? So, I got the portable one and I was gonna mount that next to the original one and it should be able to give me the right vision. You know, I was actually just talking to my buddy about about your um about your truck. Uh huh. And um I was gonna, he actually asked a good question. Um on your radio unit, your your radio unit's the one that's got like uh a small screen. Like, it doesn't even really have a big screen, right? We don't even have a screen. Yeah, we got a small screen. This is, you know, for the radio and all that. Yeah, yeah. But it's not like a like a four inch display or some **** No. Yeah, he mentioned and I don't know if this is, I mean, it seems like this should be like a possible but he mentioned that you should just switch out the the radio unit with the the model that's like got the bigger face for the display and that way you use that like you basically just switch for the camera to from like the rear view to the and he mentioned that being a thing and um I that I hadn't thought of before um but yeah, I mean, cuz uh you know, with my my backup cameras like in my like when I see it in my radio, not in my room. Yeah, see, the portable one I got, it's got a screen on it, right? So, and it's it should be a easy fix, right? I just don't know how to do it. Yeah. That's the that's the that's the thing. I got all the parts for it but I I just don't know how to do it. Yeah. And I really don't wanna uh tamper with something and and and it's electrical and then knock out a whole bunch of **** Right. Yeah, it's better to have somebody else do it. That's yeah and I yeah, I know what you mean. Some of those things. It's like when you got the money, it's better to just pay somebody else that's you know, so you don't have to worry about breaking something. Right and then it once if it's done right, then I'm alright. See what I'm saying? You know, a lot of guys have had these uh Tesla screens put in their car and they're knocked out all kind of **** You know, they didn't took like Tesla screen and put it in a Chevy, right? Right. And and they done had all kind of problems. You know, I had actually got the uh portable for my car, right? Uh huh. I just don't know how to put it in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That does look nice. Um yeah, I was looking at the cost of that other people charge to put the something like that in. Uh huh. Like people charge like minimum like 400, 400 to $800. That's like pretty much the going rate like and it's not that it's like super difficult. It's like just a lot of uh kind of tedious like you gotta really be uh careful about where the wires are going and how they're sitting and yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's the that's the important part. Okay. Well, like I said, in a couple of weeks, I'm gonna give you a call and then we'll work from there. Yeah. Uh yeah. I'm I'm I'm patient. I'm yeah and I'm also pretty resourceful. I don't know if you have um any side gigs. Maybe I can I don't I don't like smoke weed or anything like that but I know people around me do. I don't know if that is something. I don't know. I don't do. I don't do nothing. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't do that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't I don't smoke or really drink either actually but yeah, some of those things I guess but whenever whenever the time does come uh I'll be ready for you but if you know anybody else uh yeah just give me a call. Are you gonna? I think uh JC might be coming out to that place tonight. Are you gonna be with him? No. No. JC. Let me and JC uh we work different jobs now. He's still at second chance. I I I got a different job now. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? What do you switch into doing? What are you doing now? Yeah. I work for uh a paper production company. Okay. Is that over by seventeenth or something? Seventeenth. No, it's out in Fridley. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's like some sort of recycling thing. No, actually, they uh cut and put uh paper and ship it. Internationally at that uh locally, internationally to different other companies. So, they basically cut the paper and put it on skids and they and then I guess they sell it to different companies. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm without looking it up on my phone. I'm pretty sure I know which building you're talking about but I have to pull up the GPS but I I've had to meet a couple people there for my like actual work. I know a couple of kinda younger guys that work there. Okay. But you like it? Yeah. It pays more. Yeah. I never I should never be mad at being paid more. Yeah. Is it is it like actual? I mean, you don't actually have to tell me what the dollar amount is but is it actually **** good? Well, it's more than what I was being paid. You know, and uh it pays every week. So, that's a good thing. More than twenty-eight? No, no. Okay. Oh, hey, look, I gotta call you back. My wife on the other hand. Sounds good. I'll talk to you later. Alright, appreciate you. Yeah, bye. Alright, bye-bye.

Hello? Hi, this is Birdie with Gateway Northeast. I'm giving a call back. Oh, hey, how's it going? I think you spoke with Charlie, our AI assistant. I'm okay, how are you? I'm okay. So, yeah, that kind of caught me off guard talking to that thing. Yeah, it's a little iffy. Who is this? So, my name is Brandon Gillis and I am calling on behalf of Rebecca Aspinmall, who is a resident, and I could actually get her on the phone in a three-way call just to kind of confirm that we're cool to talk, but she was explaining to me that she just moved in to this place and she basically has been working during the hours that staff here has been trying to finish her onboarding and her enrollment and energy and stuff like that. We just had some staff changes and I'm not totally familiar with the situation. I can give you a direct number that Rebecca gave me a call back at so I could answer her specific questions and I could also reach out to my colleagues who are now working at different properties. Okay. I've got a paper and pen. Alrighty, so my direct phone number is 763 233-6152. I had to change pages at the last minute. 763-263 No, 763-233 and then the last four is 6152. Okay. I can actually get her on a three-way call right now if that would be helpful. Sure, no problem. One second. Okay. What's up? Hey, I'm going to add you to a three-way call real quick, okay? Okay. Hurry up. I'm at work. Okay. Is everybody here? Can everybody hear me? Yep. Hello. Hi. How are you, Rebecca? I'm good. How are you? He didn't tell me who this was. Okay. Hi. How are you? Good. Hello. Hi. So what is going on exactly? I'm not sure that I understand. Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. I was going to actually call and leave the message. So just because I work weird hours, I'm here until five and then it's just really hard to get anything done or to be able to sit down with you guys. The other lady, other gal, which I can never remember her name. Taylor? Yeah, Taylor. Yes. She had said that she could sit down with me one day to kind of go over everything because I never really got the official move-in tour and that kind of stuff or what to do. So I don't really know too much, but also I really need help setting up my electric. And so my friend, I was wondering if you guys could explain it to my friend that's there and he is going to help me set it up. We already set up your electric for you. Okay. We send a message directly to Xcel Energy and then they would start the billing. Right. But is there some sort of app or something? I'm just not really good with apps and all that. So that's where my friend kind of comes in. Sure. Is there like an app that goes with that? Yeah. So we use Xcel Energy. So once you get your first statement, you'll have your account number and you'll be able to go online and manage your payments directly online. And I do think they have an app. I don't use it, but I believe they do have an app. Oh, okay. Yeah. See, I must not have gotten my first bill yet then. Yeah. Which is weird. Sometimes it does take a minute. Okay. Yeah. You moved in in October though or was it November? It was November. Early November. So you might be getting one very soon here. Okay. Good. All right. Yeah. Because it was November 10th, maybe 7th or 10th. Yeah. Somewhere around there. November 7th I see is your lease date. So that would have been the date that we would have requested of Xcel to start the service. So you should be good to go there. I'll check your file and make sure that we have that confirmation in place, but I just paid last month's bills for our vacant units and yours wasn't on the list. So that does tell me that it is at least not in Gateway Northeast's name currently. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. I was just going to say so that I could double check. Sometimes I think we get in the confirmation email, we get an account number, which I would be more than happy to share with you. And then I can also send you a link to the Xcel Energy website if you'd like. And then I would love to schedule a time to do an orientation with you. I just need a little bit of an advance notice. And then also I am going to be out of the office on holiday until after Christmas starting Thursday. It might not be until just after Christmas, but I will be in the office on the 26th and then every day except for New Year's Day the following week. Okay. Yeah, see I get off so late. It didn't add up with any of the other two's hours. So I don't know what your hours are. Yeah, I mean as long as we arrange it in advance, I'd be more than happy to adjust my hours for you is what I'm saying. Okay. So if we need an appointment I'd be happy to. That would be great. I have bowling on Thursdays. That's my only thing. That would be the only day that I couldn't stay a little late for you. Yeah, that would be great. So after the holidays, you're thinking? Yeah, so when after the holidays I'm available. I'm pretty much open any day. I wouldn't make time for it any day after five. Yeah, Monday at like 530. Yeah, that'd be perfect. Get it done with the beginning of the week. Monday the 29th. Yeah, that'll work. I'll send a calendar invite to you. Is there any other questions that I can answer while you've got me? Yeah, in the bathroom is there supposed to be like a fan that's running at all or how does that thing work? The exhaust should just be running at all times. Okay, because it's not. Yeah, if there was like a fan or something you know that to get all like the moisture out or you know take a shower. I'll just make a note that I'll make a work order that the bath exhaust isn't working. Would they be able to maintenance come when they're able to get to it? Yeah, absolutely. I mean if it's Yeah, absolutely. I mean if they could give me 24 hours heads up would be awesome. But if I'm completely open to them going in without me there. Yeah, I think the soonest it would be would be this week Thursday. That's their assigned maintenance day at the property. They're here on Mondays and Thursdays. So it would either be this coming Thursday or the following Monday. Perfect. Yeah, that would be great. And is there anything well, I guess they'll go over that with when we do the orientation, but my friend that I was on the phone with said that I might that door lock thing might be able to be remote. Is that a thing an auto lock? Yeah, are you guys able to turn the adjust the settings on her on her door so that it auto locks like after 30 seconds. No. Yeah, that would lock me out because I forget my keys all the time. But that would be cool if there was like an app or something where you can lock it from your smart, but they're not that smart. Everything has an app these days. It sure does. Except for our lock. Anything else? No, that is it. I believe we're going to put an appointment on my calendar for 530. I'm going to check your resident file and see what I have on record for your electricity account. And then I'll enter a work order for that exhaust fan for your bathroom. Okay. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. You're welcome. And then I've also going to email you my direct email. So you don't have to talk to our AI assistant in the future because it can be a little confusing. Thank you. Appreciate that. Yeah, you're welcome. Well, let me know in the meantime if there's anything else. Otherwise, we'll be in touch. Okay. Have a great day. Thanks, Birdie. You too. Take care. Bye-bye.

Yeah, it's all over. It's not really popping out. Yes. I was just a thought. And then I'll throw this in there. I thought I left it out. Here. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. It doesn't. Yeah. I mean, It depends. Like if he has to have it like right now, right now. That's fine. But I don't. Yeah. Yeah. You did cut out a little bit. Yeah, it's not for me. It's for my buddy.

Hi. How's it going? It's going good. I'm just laying on the couch. So, you're lying on the couch? Yeah. You just got back from running errands. Yeah. Running errands? Running errands. Is that what you said? Yeah, we got a car wash and we picked up a package at mom's old place. I gotcha. Cool. Yeah, sorry, I'm kind of going from one thing to another. I just sent that email to that caseworker and I talked to her. She seemed pretty nice. What? The caseworker for Emma. Right. What about her? The caseworker? Yeah, she seemed pretty nice. I just made sure that I had her email and made sure that she received it. Right. I just kind of wanted to double check with you to make sure that that is still relevant. Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure it is. She's still staying at Dina's, to my knowledge at least. Okay. Next subject is, I feel like, I don't know, we've been, there's been like a break in our communication or something. And I think I understand why. And I just wanted to talk to you about the school thing. Right. Yeah, I guess it was because of our lack of correct, properly communicating. You know, it's kind of delayed us a little bit, which is frustrating, of course. I think I just, I think I understand, I guess, like you kind of feel a little bit of pressure that you don't want to like hurt my feelings or me to feel some type of way about it. And, yeah, I mean, I just wanted to let you know that I'm not mad, of course. But, you know, it's not your responsibility to, you know, worry about my feelings. It's my responsibility to worry about yours. To a degree. So, yeah, I guess if mom is is okay with them, and she doesn't mind enrolling you like immediately. Yeah, then she can go ahead and do that. Sounds like Emily from playful healing is like, is going to continue to work with Ellen Ashton. But I think I couldn't really fully understand if you've missed too many sessions that you like you are canceled or something like that or you still have like one more chance I don't really know. Yeah, I think I have like one more. Like one more chance. But otherwise. Yeah, I've missed like four sessions. What are you wanting to do. What do you mean. Probably down here. Okay. Yeah. Are you okay. I just haven't been feeling the greatest today. I have a headache and I've been lightheaded all day. And, yeah, my stomach's been upset all day. Yeah. I'm sorry I hope you feel better. We all just get out. Yeah, hopefully, maybe you'll feel better after you take a long shower or something. Yeah, I think that's what I'm going to do after I eat something, try to eat something. Yeah, actually, that's what I got to do right now is warm up some food and. Yeah, what are you even doing. I'm staying over at a friend's house and basically couch surfing. And what my plan was to, you know, work. You know this whole week. But then on Monday, there was like, I guess kind of a change in plan, because, because I took that administrative leave. I guess they, I was supposed to do like a mandatory appointment. And I didn't do it so I have to, I can't like work with clients until I, you know, complete that appointment, that requirement. As soon as I can, I can do it as possibly tonight, but for sure on Thursday night. I was. Yeah, when I found that out. I was like, Okay, so do I go back tomorrow, or do I like try to make this work somehow. And I figured I'd be resourceful because I had like four different people, five people hit me up within the last week to do car work. Even though I don't have any tools with me at all. I think I'm able to work it out where I'm able to meet with somebody that does have tools and split the money with them. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, that I'm also looking for, like, I'm going to start applying it at some other places and kind of thinking about leaving this company. Brandon. What, why don't if you have time today why don't you call here and see what's going on with that money. Yeah, I've seen the text thread I could do that. Like, I mean I know you obviously need money but like I could definitely use that money like because that was kind of like the money I'd set aside for like moving in and like getting things for here and like. But now with being being so slow at work like I'm, yeah, I could definitely use. You've been watching the news at all lately about Hennepin County DHS. No. They just uncovered like an extravagant like fraud fraudulent thing with some of the Hennepin County Department, DHS, like administrators people whatever. What was like the Somalis or something. Yeah, some Middle Eastern cat like basically, it sounds like he embezzled like $80 billion or something like that. That's probably why they keep denying your money. So I'm thinking is like, obviously they've got like some fucking holes in their, in their system. It's pretty crazy that it's been this long, I think I might even hit up my attorney and just tell her what's up. Maybe this could fucking spark some additional fucking court. Well yeah because I feel like there has to be something it was court ordered like they don't have a choice that has to be paid. Right. No, we're not going to do that like the judges above you. I think courts, it's okay for the court and the judges to not show up to court and reschedule things and not tell me but when I do it, I go to jail. Right. No, I know I agree it's fucked up. I did see her number or text message whatever I'm gonna hit her up and do all that stuff. Okay. My lunch. Well I just picked up Ashton's gift Eva's is ready, and Ella's will be here in the next day or two like for their big gifts. Okay. And me and Gabby are going to go to five below on Sunday to get some like stocking stuffers and whatever pick out some stuff together. When you guys come down. Okay. All right. Sorry I don't have much longer to talk, but I only have a little bit of time to eat some food before I have to like, go and get dirty. Okay. I'll talk to you soon. Oh, you gotta let me know as soon as you get that fucking insurance card to do. I know okay I'm trying and like it's really starting to piss me off because I like did the application I submitted it I turned in all the proofs like I took pictures of my pay stubs like everything. And then there's like no I can't find my application on the app or like on the portal so then I called yesterday, and then they said some weird shit and they're like okay but we'll transfer you to your caseworker and then I left a message and I've called like three times and I'm still can't get in touch with anyone so I'm trying anything in the mail. No. That means you didn't try gonna. What about if you go to the, your email, and you look for something like, like an automatic reply. No, I didn't but it's like I have something from them but the lady said something about like I already had an open case so they didn't take my application but I don't have an open case because I don't have anything going so I don't understand that's why they were trying to transfer me to someone like my caseworker who could help me. Because when I go to try and apply again it says I can't apply because I already have an application submitted. From like when you were getting food stamps or some shit or cash assistance when you're still in treatment. No, for the insurance the insurance is separate than the food stamps I applied for food stamps also I'm waiting for a call back from that as well but don't do that. I didn't do that I need the food stamps brandon like the girls that you make. What. They're not going to give you any food stamps because the amount of money that you make. That's not true I I submitted all my income and they said I qualify, and that I am expedited approved for expedited benefits. So maybe mom isn't really Bill Gates, no I'm not Bill Gates that's why when you're always like oh you have all the money like I literally don't. I went to Sherbourne County and we applied for benefits and food and whatever. And because I made like, like, 280 or $400 a month from my, my weekend warrior thing. They're like, you're going to get like 100 bucks a month. I don't really remember that. But no, that was also because we only had like what we didn't have any kids we only have like one kid or something on there. So like four people is under the poverty guideline. Yeah, you're going to get me if I can investigate for fraud. Why, obviously I'm already collecting food, food benefits for all the kids. Well, they will I'll just tell them that they just moved in with me so you're not going to be getting anything for fraud. You guys can still have for the boys and then I'll get it for the girls here. I'm staying there to stay and where with me. Yeah. Although I didn't give them an address I just told my caseworker that to what the fuck. That's why I told you to fucking get ahold of me. That made no sense Brandon but I'm not telling them that you're living with me that's crazy because then you're working and you're going to go off your income and I'm not going to get anything. The thing is you shouldn't apply for food stamps because with the amount of food stamps that I get. It takes care of everybody. And it doesn't go because you guys bring food on Sundays and then I have to pay for food every other night of the week. You guys have get all of the food stamps that doesn't help me. I mean well you do get some of the food stamps but anyways, like I said it's easier for me to probably share the card with you. Because, yeah, I mean I forgot I knew having you apply and doing all that shit was going to be a fucking headache. I'm probably like, if they if you can't get ahold of somebody about the medical stuff resubmit new application. Brandon that's what I just said it won't let me submit a new application because it says I already have one processing for the family but you as an as a family not an individual. Correct. Weird. I haven't applied that's why I've been waiting to apply for myself because I knew the kids are moving in with me. And since I made too much money for just myself for insurance I knew that once I had the kids that I would qualify again for insurance for myself and for them. You would have qualified for insurance. Like, under any circumstance. I wouldn't know, Brandon you act like I haven't already gone through this I know what I'm talking about. What do you, what do you say, are you, you're saying they wouldn't give you a county insurance. They said I made too much money I would have to do one where I paid per month and I wasn't trying to do that so I waited a couple months until the kids moved in with me. And now because I'm a caretaker of minors under 18, and my income I qualify for county like Minnesota care or whatever and the girls will as well. So that's what I'm trying to figure it out. I've been calling I've been doing everything I'm supposed to be doing like there's only so much I can do, though. So yes, I'm working on it I'm going to keep calling up and I'll let you know as soon as I have more information, Milo, you will set up your Christmas. Yeah, we're gonna have to circle back to all this because, yeah, we're gonna have to talk a little bit more. But you guys have a nice day. Thank you. I'll say a little prayer for you.

Yeah, you little dick ass, little dick in the booty ass motherfucker. These are way too many sex words. I don't know if you know this, but I'm like about to have a medical crisis, a health crisis.

I guess that sounds a little weird, like the context of it. I should have really put the emphasize that it's going to be your booty. Of course. And I'm already super thankful. I'm just kidding.

Yeah, you are, I've been watching. Are you able to talk through that camera? I don't think so. Because I went out into the living room to throw something away or something.

If I wanted to record it, I gotta use my money. Use money. Yeah, that's why you put in the SD card, remember? Yeah, but I don't need one. I know you don't need one, but it's, like, good to have it because... Oh, backup. Because if the internet goes out, then it stops recording, because it only records stuff to the cloud, or saves it to the cloud. But if you have an SD card in there, even if the internet does go out, it'll still record, because it's being saved on the internal storage, you know? And when you're trying to watch smart people, because if it was me, I'll just fucking cut the Wi-Fi off, and I'd become invisible. But if you have an SD card in there, I can't do that. Oh, I see. See, you're learning stuff every day. Yeah. I'm proud of you. How much is Amazon Prime? Like, 10 or 12 bucks a month. That's not a lot. And you still gotta pay for the fucking... You still gotta pay for movies. For movies? Well, I'm talking about shipping. Yeah, so you get, like, a fucking Netflix sort of subscription, and you get, like, premium shipping, like... Oh, really? Yeah. It does, like, save a bunch. Like, almost everything that you purchase will be, like, I don't know, like $10 less, because of, like, some sort of Amazon Prime shipping scenario. Yeah, Dan said that he's not specifying how much money he has, but he's pretty much already told us that he's gonna take whatever we have, like, when we go out there. You following me? Hold on. Oh, yeah. Just call me on your next break, okay? No, no, no, I'm here. You said what? I talked to Dan, and he said that, like, he hasn't specified how much money he has, but he said that he would basically take whatever we had. Oh, like you want some dope? Yeah, yeah. So I would recommend getting, like, a QP. Okay. Yeah. And then we go on a little road trip. Would it be the same price as VidaFound? Unfortunately for him, yeah, it pretty much is, because I tell him that I pay $900 for my quarter pounds, so that's what I have to pay, but he has to pay me, like, more than that. So it's usually, like, $1,200 or $1,300 that he'll give me in return. Oh. Oh. Okay. So, basically, if you give him that quarter QP, then you'll have the money to pick up the pounds, and that'd be all yours. That is actually, if you, yeah, you'd have to probably actually pay back the QP money, so I don't, or I don't know what you got worked out, but I just figured I'd provide resources and fucking check you out. Yeah. Possibly. Okay, I gotta go. Yeah, I couldn't see how much I have in my bank account, but I don't like spending my money. You what? Oh, dang it. I don't like spending my money, so.

tomorrow night and i'll be able to get uh and to see the the counselor so um but here here's another thing um while having these conversations um um uh one of my conversations i had with uh azac the one of the admins that hired me um i don't know he's like i'm not really quite understanding that uh oh i don't know let me let me start over so this is a guy that hired me right of course it makes sense that um considering that i've never been in this field before i've never you know i have zero work experience in this um uh the starting wage for tip is typically like i think he said like 19 or i don't know whatever the fuck that number was um was different than uh the number that i had seen as advertised you know because when i applied i thought it said like 23 and um and then you know once he said that i was hired uh i seen like my contract come through and it said something different i i brought it up to him and i renegotiated with him and he's like and he was cool about it he's we had like a good civilized conversation where i had to explain to him the reasons why i thought it was necessary that i be handled differently and um you know i basically told him like you know the hour-long commute you know the uh you know basically my family size my you know what my bills are already and like the level of commitment that i would have doing this um and he's like yeah good good i guess i guess we could do that and i just want you to uh make sure that you are helping out in the same cloud like a lot basically he's been all about me going to st cloud a lot because i guess they're the people out there are like ship bags as far as like the people he's hired um so today when i i had that last conversation with uh one of the office ladies over the phone she's like so you had a uh an oral agreement with azac that i in order to um for you to get your pay rate like it was expected that you were going to be working in st cloud and i was like well yeah i i do work in st cloud i still have clients out there that i'm talking to and she's like okay and then she sounded like she was about to get off the phone with me but i was like hold on just so to avoid any like disappointment or miscommunication later like so does that statement mean that like i'm only allowed to work in st cloud and i i'm gonna have to like transition my clients that i have out in minneapolis to like somebody else and she's like what you can work in mora and i was like okay but just to clarify you don't want me working in minneapolis you want me to focus on st cloud and she's like yes and um yeah i don't know i feel like uh kind of irritated with that i guess i don't know mixed emotions because um this guy's kind of making it sound like i'm not holding up my end of the bargain but like it literally says in my contract that i can work anywhere yeah and the fact that i'm like driving an hour i don't know i just don't like the attitude that i was just given a little bit ago and regards to that like i haven't like 23 bucks an hour is like i should be super thankful for it yeah well they paid more than i will yeah i don't know i guess here are my thoughts um like i i'm seeing um um i don't know i'm just sensing that i i don't know i'm sensing that me in this company me and some of the admin people are not going to agree with my feelings that you know this is the lowest paying job i've ever had and i feel like maybe i'm ready to transition to another company that you know offers me 40 hours and you know a pay rate that i can you know take home yeah and i don't want to like i'd like to be able to use my experience here my time here uh as a good thing and not like and um you know on bad terms right i don't know that's what i guess i'm considering is like what my my professional approach to yeah yeah too bad you can't just work at recovering hope work at recovering hope um yeah no i mean i'm as i understand like i am uh they one of my office ladies did actually now oh my gosh why would you do that yeah no are you okay little baby like this little baby like straight up like disarm him and shoved him to the ground you okay you want to go that way okay sorry um yeah there it sounds like there is a even though they're on their website it doesn't say that they're hiring uh cprs's there was like a conversation between huda and uh annie thompson which is one of the ladc's at recovering hope yes i know there was talk of um we're doing uh working there of what um see i don't i don't know i freaking i'm really kind of like she never really gives me like the full like the full fucking conversation or like the full like pieces everything she doesn't she hasn't given me all the information i need to know in order for me to be like okay hey here's an email uh blah blah blah what what is this uh memorem memorandum of understanding going to look like yeah i don't know but i have been told that i should hit up annie i'm just very confused about what they want me to talk to her about i just asked them like hey like my boss said to hit you up i don't know if it's for a position i don't know if it's to fucking merge something like do you have any more information i don't know yeah yeah because yeah i mean that would be cool because then we would both be at recovering hope and like you'd be in the area and like um i don't know typically they have like they have those buses and stuff so like if you were to be taking clients like to appointments or like whatever your job role was like how jess takes them to the meetings and stuff like she just drives the fucking the bus so you don't even need a car but like if you needed a car and like i was at work and we're in the same town like you could just use my car and so we got you a car instead of like having to drive like an hour away with our only vehicle right right it would be pretty cool to uh work back close to home right yeah well and i know that i mean it's just winter time so like you'd probably still eventually want to do your other thing of like roofing or whatever it was right yeah that's not until like march or april right and hopefully like yeah i don't know i'm i was like semi talking to kiana about because like she was talking about or like i said something about taxes and then she's like yeah i mean me and brandon kind of discussed like me claiming the girls since i've worked longer and i was like well and i don't know if like they're going to try to take anything from brandon if he were to claim them so like it would probably just be smart if you claimed them but like work out some sort of like payment arrangement or whatever like um whether that's like paying stuff that you need paid with the money or like her just giving you some money because i mean technically like yeah they live with her now but they were with us the whole last year um yeah yeah um i know like last year i i let i let her claim or actually i don't think she claimed them last year because we didn't have them last year but yeah nobody claimed the girl last year because they were only with us for like three months and you're technically claiming them for the whole previous year or they were only with us for a month at that point when i did my taxes um yeah um but she told you that i she already she already is planning on me allowing her to claim them is that what you were saying yeah something like that but you guys had talked about it or something because like she's worked more this year than you have but i think i mean regardless of who works more i mean because that's like a separate thing i want to say or maybe it is all federal and or the kids are state i don't know i don't know where the funds go per se if it's federal or state but from my experience last year i know if you owe anything to the fucking state or whatever they're gonna fucking take it from you so and you owe the state money i owe federal money or state yeah i was state money yeah so i don't know if the kids being claimed goes on federal or state but just to be safe i would imagine just working something out with her like hey like you got this much money most of that is much money most of that is the kids like working out some kind of a payment plan of some sort well i mean technically you could claim like i mean technically you could claim the kids like so you'd have all five of them yeah i guess but i'm also like then i don't know if you have to be like per se a legal guardian or whatever like because i was a guardian but not legally like you know you guys are their parents yeah like i have i have sole physical custody and i just share legal so i mean what i was gonna say but like we're not like if let's say if we were married you're like the financial provider in the household so i mean that's it would make perfect sense for you to claim the kids it doesn't matter if they're not like biologically yours or there's no but like yeah i guess but i mean i'm not gonna i'm pretty sure that like you you can only like caps out after a certain amount of kids anyways so like there's like a maximum so i think you can only get like three i think you can only claim like a maximum three uh like kids or something like you can claim more but you're only going to get the benefits for like three no matter if you how many kids you have right well like i said i mean we're not you know on that weird like fucking i fuck you over you fuck me over shit i'm sure kiana will claim them and like you know do some like budgeting of like giving us money and i mean i claimed the boys and i worked all last year so like i don't really i don't per se want money for myself i just want money like so that you can get whatever you need completed so like it would it's really just between you and kiana like i don't really need to be involved i i would just get involved huh shut up gabby what i i you don't have to do any of the thinking i will figure it out all right if i'm going to claim the kids then it would be on your taxes like hypothetically if i wanted to it wouldn't be i wouldn't be like claiming them on mine all right so i'm not gonna like do all my figuring that out right now but it is a little um what do you call that bold for her to be like oh brandon said like that was like a year ago you guys had some sort of agreement i don't know maybe i don't know i'm not i'm i'm not starting anything i could have thought that's like what we had discussed anyways but uh because i had mentioned something about your car or whatever and i was like i can help you out but like not like right this second like obviously like when taxes come like i'm a little bit more uh financially able to you know help out but like no not her like you because i think we were talking about your car or something oh because i had mentioned that your shoes like what is he doing all next week like out and i was like well because he can't work like in the cities and like i can't take him all week like he's gonna stay out there oh my god hmm yeah what that's crazy when you hear of rob reiner and his wife yeah i just read that like uh i don't know like two hours ago i mean i'm just reading like little posts but do you think their son really did it yeah it's uh it was like they instantly knew their law enforcement made an arrest like right away i don't know any details but that's the guy who played uh in wolf of wall street like you know the you know the caprio's dad yeah he's in a few things that i've seen it's so awkward what no just like a picture like i think it's a popular like so the girl that you think is hot from particular lives the mormon wife she's currently filming the bachelorette she's the bachelorette and um they like caught like a picture of her like on one of those like single dates or whatever like you know when they go on dates with like just one person instead of like a group of people and like it just heard this guy and like the cameraman and like obviously i know reality tv like obviously there's someone with a camera but it just looks so funny like they're literally just sitting there and then there's just one dude with a camera like filming them yeah uh all right okay i gotta i'm gonna make a like one or two more phone calls to see if i can line it up for tomorrow just kind of like it sucks because i don't have like any of my tools or any of my clothes and i like to be working i hear tomorrow's supposed to be kind of night today was i mean in relative to the weather that it has been is like kind of nice but i think wednesday is supposed to be not super nice and then thursday is like whatever wednesday thursday is supposed to be a little bit better yeah today wasn't as bad as i thought it was going to be like when i woke up this morning i thought it was going to be like fucking freezing ass cold yeah no it was surprisingly warm yeah no it was surprisingly warm i was talking to karen about it i'm like it's so funny how conditioning works because like when it started getting colder i'm like oh my god it's so cold and it was only like 40 degrees but now that it's dropped below zero for a couple days today i was like oh 24 it feels so nice uh how are the boys doing they're good i think after this phone call i need to change their diapers or whatever today was pajama day so they went in their little uh grinch pajamas matching pajamas yeah yeah but they were good alex seemed like he was in a good mood when i picked him up oh it was so cute so i went and got alex first and then he was like obviously up and playing and whatever and then we get his shoes on and we go into atlas's room and i like walked in and like alex kind of like walked over to alice and he goes hey and he like taps him on the back and then atlas like looks at him and then looks over at me and then he runs over to me and i was like that's so cute yeah yeah all right mom um all right have you been holding the baby i

Um, but no, I got a call from my attorney earlier and she said that my thing, like, I basically won my case and that appeal is going through and stuff and so I should be good on my end.

And so I went to subway first and like right when I was waiting for these people I could see inside that they were like you know finishing their sandwiches or whatever and I was like about to leave the kids in there and just run in there. And then I noticed one of them was Sadie and I was like shit and so I had to like take the boys out of the car because I knew I would be like in there longer. And then they were just fucking running around subway crazy. Yeah, Alex is like, he like the first thing he does is run inside and grabs a bag of chips and he like is pointing at me and like shaking in front of me and I'm like yeah you can have that. I'm talking to Sadie. And then once we were like she was, we were done talking and I was ordering.

You know, get my Monday through Friday hours down here. Okay. Is currently not going to work out as smoothly as I had hoped because while I was on leave last month I didn't do my LADC appointment. Um, I'm pretty sure I was told that I didn't have to. But yeah, I'm pretty sure I fucking actually don't because I only need to see the LADC every like 20 hours of meeting with clients and I haven't had 20 hours. But, you know, basically the soonest I could meet with my LADC is Thursday, possibly tomorrow night. If they like cancel. Yeah. But until then, um, I came up with a great idea of calling back some of those people that needed work done. One of them is calling me back right now. Okay, call me back. Alright, bye. Bye. Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I don't need no oil change or no motherfucking air filter. So what? A hundred dollars. Oh, no. Well, for the tuna, this was spark plugs and wires. Spark plug wire. Where the fuck am I? No, the O2 sensor. It's a hundred bucks. You don't need to do that. No. Yeah, and plugs and wires is 160 then. You put plugs, wires, air filter, and oil change for 160. If I don't need the oil change or the air filter, I have still 160. I mean, it's going to take us like two, possibly two hours to get all that shit out of there. Two and a half hours. To get spark plugs out? It don't take that long to get no spark plugs out. Spark plugs out? Yeah. I mean, yeah, the front ones are easy to get to, but the ones in the back, they're fucking ups a pain. Yeah, so what, 125? 125, hold on. 125 for the, and you don't need to do the O2 sensor though. All right, go do that. I'll wait to do that. All right. You want to do it tonight though? Yeah. Getting high, nigga. Yeah, we ain't wasting no bullets. And on top of that, nigga, I'm not giving nobody a hundred dollars to go to they club for two hours, nigga. I ain't doing that neither, so I'm going to be at somebody's house getting high and bringing in a new year. Man, you'll never believe it. You know, it's actually my birthday today. Huh? It's actually my birthday today. Oh, you got the same birthday as my bitch ass baby mama? It happens, man. It happens. I know, right? Don't be like her. Fucking already hitting you up for money?

Hey, how's it going? Doing all right. Yeah, I just wanted to give you a call back. Just kind of, I don't know, share two of the people that I talked with earlier about the different vehicles working on. You want me to text it to you or you just want me to fucking spit it out? Yeah, text it. That'll probably be easiest. That way I've got a record as well so I can go and roughly what and look it up. Okay, all right. I'll just text it to you then. All right. Yeah, I still have my arms and we're watching, uh, was it Tulsa Kings? No. Landman or... Uh, sounds familiar. He's like came out or something, right? Yeah, it's pretty new. Oh, okay. I think this is the second, I think it's the third time I've seen it. We watched a couple episodes a little bit. Pretty good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll have to look that up. Have you ever seen Tulsa Kings? I don't think so, but it is on Netflix. Um, Tulsa Kings I think is on Paramount. That one's, uh, Sylvester Stallone. That one's, I recommend that one's really good. Um, oh yeah, so basically the two different vehicles I've heard back from yet is, uh, the first one is a 2007 GMC Yukon Denali and he wants an O2 sensor replaced and I told him, so an O2 sensor and a tune-up, which is, you know, plugs, wires, air filter and maybe an oil change. Yeah, and you don't know if you need coil packs or a rotor and the other dude. Well, he, he basically said that if, uh, like we're not, he's getting his own parts. So, which is a little different. Um, I mean, if you did have the coil packs, I probably would. Yeah, that's going to easily 150 more because the coil packs are here and spending, I mean, they're easy to replace, but depending on where they're at, that can be painful. Where's the cap and rotor? These ones just go right over it. The cap and rotor, yeah, yeah. They actually just like pop. The labor time, the standard labor time for like plugging wires. They like say an hour and a half to two hours just for that. And then it's supposed to be like an hour and a half to two hours just for, uh, one or two sensors. You pull it out like this. Depending on where the sensor is or what sensor, otherwise there's multiple sensors. Yeah, I know, I know that there's a, it like splits off into two on the exhaust. So if it's like, I don't know if he wants us to do both of them or like the one that's like really close to the engine. Yeah. With one of those, you're probably going to have to heat the exhaust up in order to get them to go free, but you might not. You might get lucky, but otherwise, yeah, they tend to get stuck in the exhaust pretty good. But if they are able to come free, they work pretty well. It's not too difficult. And a lot of times it's like, uh, you'll see a specialty school, like, uh, it'll be like a depot socket. And, uh, the little, like one of the sections cut out, that's where the wire will go. So as you, you put the, put that on there and then you put the wire outside. The other, you have to go with a, uh, not an open end wrench, but like a closed buck wrench, closed buck wrench or box wrench, which everybody's got them, but it just depends on the angles. That's the hard part. You don't happen to have any of those, uh, uh, those open box wrench for the O2 sensors do you? I got a ton of box wrenches. Oh, uh, oh yeah. And so on the other vehicle, totally, totally different vehicle. Uh, and I don't actually, I don't know if this second vehicle is mobile or if we got to go to him or not, but it's, uh, an 08, uh, BMW 2008 BMW. He needs an alternator and rear brakes. Uh, I'd have to look up a video on that, but it should be fairly easy. Yeah, that's what I double check because I never worked on a BMW before. Would have been the Beamer and the Jetta and the, and the fucking, like, they're the basically all sister vehicles where you need that special tool to get the alternator off. Like the flat thing, flat bar thing for the tensioner. Oh, your pry bar? Yeah. Or a, uh, yeah, or yeah, should the tensioner, that's usually, that's not usually too difficult. Usually that's fairly easy. Yeah, typically, but I've had to do that just before on the side of it. Actually, I was stranded on a hotel and I was like, oh, okay, there it is. And I was like, okay, it's like, should I get it up from the top or should I get it up from the bottom? And then like, as you get going, like you realize that the fucking nightmare to get to fucking do it either way without having that fucking tool. But it's free, the tool is free to rent. All right, I'll make sure to grab my long wrench, my long wrenches, just in case. Those ones are usually pretty helpful in situations like that. Yeah. And I actually didn't meet this person personally. So the person that fucking told him the alternator was $50 for labor, uh, I think is, uh, uh, fucking crazy, but 150. So basically $200, um, altogether for the alternator and the rear brakes on this BMW. And, um, well, the rear brakes, I would probably take roughly half an hour. The alternator that, again, it's going to take about an hour to fix everything. So that's pretty close to shop prices. Yeah. If not a little underrated for the prices, but being going to the shop, they're going to pay a little more. Um, uh, the rear brakes or, uh, disc or drum brakes. Yes. That makes it a little more difficult because you got all the springs and everything, all the hardware that has to come out and then put everything back together. Yeah. I fucking hate doing those. But it's, yeah, I always take a picture that way and make sure, okay, this goes here, this goes here, this goes here. Yep. All right. I don't know if that guy's like mobile or if he can come to us or something, but if he can't, for some reason, then he's that that's located in fucking, uh, Huntington place apartments. You know where that is, right? Uh, I can see the sign and everything in my head. I can't think of where it's at off top of my head. And it's like off of Broadway and, um, Dane right. Basically. Gosh, that's super close. Yeah. And then, uh, the, the Denali guy, uh, he said that he'll come to wherever we're at. I'm just waiting. Denali. That's the same thing as the Chevy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Denali and the Cadillac Escalade though. They're all sister vehicles. Yeah. There's the Cadillac. You need the premium parts. Yeah. Or you might need the premium parts depending on what model, because it may, you may not be able to do regular GM parts or the base parts. Cause it might, uh, might be slightly different than the other models, but we have to make sure on what model and all that, or they do. I should say. Yeah. Yeah. He's getting, he's getting some stuff this time. I would tell you to write, I'd rec, I'd recommend all of them to go to B&E for their parts. Yeah. So they should have almost all of them and they'd be able to get at a better price than, uh, like if you went to Napa or O'Reilly's. Um, yeah, I could tell him that. So I, I'm going to, I already texted both of the guys, the, the total cost and whatever. Total cost and whatever. And like, if we have to take out more than one O2 sensor, it gets a hundred bucks. It's a hundred bucks per O2 sensor. So if we've got to take out more than one, that's an additional a hundred dollars. All right. That's fair. That's reasonable. Um, and I think in both of you, that you got to be able to locate them and what access do they got to home? Yeah. So both of these, uh, Some O2 sensors, you have to loosen the exhaust off the vehicle to be able to get to them. Yeah. And that's the bitch part. Yeah. It's a manifold one. That can be a pain in the ass. Oh, I know. I hate removing headers. Um, so I think that we pretty much like the total cost of whatever their, their final outcome is, is we just split it in the middle. Um, I'm going to be like right there with you, I guess. Yep. Um, okay. Right now I'm in Oak river. Um, you want me to give you a call when I get home? Yeah. Yeah. I'll text you that information. And, uh, I mean, any more information if I get more stuff that pops up. All right. All right. I'll talk to you soon.

Hey, how's it going? Good, how are you? Can you hear me okay? Yeah. A little echo-y, but I can hear you fine. How's this? Is that better? Yeah, you're good. All right, cool. So, yeah, sorry. I'm just trying to get at something, and then I got kind of distracted or cut off, but ... So, what do you got down here for tools and, like, what's your level of interest in? Right now, I got the basic wrenches and sockets, I got a couple of heavy mauls, a lot of my electrics were stolen. I have a couple, but most of my electric impacts and all that were taken. My air compressor and all that was stolen. What about, like, scissor jacks or hydraulic jacks? You got that if needed? I got a big jack and I got little jacks for hydraulics. I do have a scissor jack, but I do not use them because I do not trust them. I've had them fail multiple times. Right. And I got a couple of stands. But would it be fair to assume that all of the stuff that you just listed is, like, kind of scattered throughout, like, your garage or something, or your truck or something? No, I put some of it's in my car, or my mom's car, some of it's in my bedroom, and the rest of it is all in the basement on top of a couch. Okay. What are you trying to fix? I fucking off the top of my head. I can't even remember. I think the last thing I heard somebody say was a 2011 Ford Escape or some shit. But I don't try to remember that. I write it all down, so I don't have to, like, think, strain my brain trying to remember all that shit. Was it a starter or alternator or brake? Yeah, I think he said a starter. This is just going off of memory. I could look at my phone. I could pull over and actually look at my phone at the conversation. But this is just one person. I think he said it was a starter and rear brakes. And then I had another guy call me who sounds like he's basically willing to, like, go wherever I tell him. And he's looking for, like, a tune up. But even though he said tune up, like, I guess I got to give him some further questions as to, like, if there is something specific he's trying to fix or if he just wants to pay me for, like, a predefined, like, plugs, wires, whatever, you know, for the tune up. And that guy, I think he has, like, a 2008 or 2011 GMC Yukon XL. Yeah, for something like that, it'll be filters, double check the belt. You want to make sure that the charging system is working properly. Yeah, plugs, wires. Yeah, that part's easy. There's a depends if it's got a coil pack or it's got a. Yeah, that's why I love AI. Well, actually, most of the stuff, like when I'm figuring out estimates, a lot of the times I'll actually just go right on, like, like, Napa, Napa, fucking dot com on their website and they like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, like, you punch in, like, what, what you're working on and what you're trying to do and then it gives you, like, an average, like, shop rate and how much parts would be so, like. I go to parts, I'd never go to Napa because Napa always high bucks the hell out of it. Yeah, I wouldn't. I actually don't really favor napa. I just like the tool that they offer on their website. Usually, if I find the tools I try and look for other places where, where I can find it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I just kind of wanted to figure out if, um, since I actually just got down, got off the phone with one of my bosses that, you know, I work like my regular job at and they gave me some, like, direction that kind of changes my, my game plan for the week. And my original game plan was to be, like, I was going to stay down here, kind of couch surf, you know, between a couple of different people that I have arrangements with. But now, sounds like I'm not going to be working my regular job. So I have, like, a couple of different people, probably like four or five people that I was going to return their calls and kind of get their information together. So I can kind of share it with you. And, you know, there's between you and there's another guy that I met back in October who kind of does, like, mobile mechanic things like his main source of income. His name is Miguel. He's from around here, too. Pretty cool. But I don't know. Maybe team up somehow and just make some money. Obviously, you don't have to agree to anything. I'm not going to sell you the dream. Anything I share with you, you're totally like, yeah, that's too much or that's too little or whatever. You don't have to do it, but you'll know ahead, before you start what you're going to be doing and how much you're going to get to, like, reduce friction. Right. Starters isn't that's fairly easy. Same with alternators, but water pump, that's a little more difficult. Radiators, those are as long as you drain it properly. It's not bad. Yeah. There's a lot of different parts, but for the most part, they're pretty easy overall because most cars are pretty damn close to the same. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I know that there's especially doing, like, starters and alternators. There's fucking I've had to do those on different vehicles where you need, like, a fucking special tool. But I don't know. I don't think I've ever needed a special tool. I mean, usually. Really? The Audis and the Jettas, I think, are the ones that you need, like, a fucking special tool where it's, like, I don't think you, like, 1,000% need it, but, like, they offer it as a special tool and it's, like, a flat thing. You basically don't have to. Oh, the belt tensioner so you can release the belt. Yeah. Yeah. Usually I just use a ratchet for that, or I got a long breaker bar I'll use for it. As long as you can get it in there. That's the hard part. Yeah. Yeah. I learned the hard way. So I actually just went and bought one of those flat fucking special tools. I did have one, and that disappeared. Yeah. Same with me. And with my truck broke down, I essentially don't have, like, any tools with me at all. I didn't. I got dropped off out here pretty much, you know. Oh, geez. So, yeah. All right. Well, I. Yeah, I'll save your number here. Yeah. I'd recommend maybe putting all your tools together, like, whether it's, like, in the garage or in a. Are you mobile to go places? Or are you only able to go to. I can. I can. I just got to. Right now, I've got to double check my charging system because my battery light came on and said, check charging system. I checked it. It was reading good volts, but the light stayed on like it wasn't charging. And I was like, all right, turn it off. Let's see what happens. Then I watched the voltage just plummet. Yeah. What do you. You know, I probably have to go get another battery. Are you driving the Silverado or something? No, I wish. I miss my Silverado. I miss my Ford. But no, I right now I got a Chevy Impala. Oh, it's not your mom's? No, I bought another one. Oh, OK. Because, yeah, mom's one down. I still have to fix mom's. I got to do the steering system on that one. That's a common problem with the Impalas. Yeah, it was the rack. First, it was the line went out and the line caused the rack to go and the pump to go. So I replaced all the lines, the pump, and then found out the racks are still out. And it's like, OK. And it was the rack went out because it was rubbing on the exhaust. The line was rubbing on the exhaust. The line was rubbing on the exhaust. And it's like, really? Just a slight flex and didn't have that problem. Well, hopefully. Yeah, it's actually really similar issues that I had. But yeah, I mean, you get it running, it's the thing runs like a champ. Well, I'm not too far away. What do you think now? Well, tonight I was planning on just hanging out with Becky at Becky's place. That was the, what did they call that? The nebulizer. Is that your mom? Yeah. Yeah, that was my mom, Rose. Tell her I said hi. Will do. OK, I'll give you a call back when I have more facts and stuff. All right. All right. Talk to you soon.

I got some clarity. So because you were out of the office for a number of times, an LABC meeting is required prior to seeing any clients. So I had to look up some of the documentation around that. And then the second thing is that you had an agreement with AVAC that your pay increase was subject to, or not subject to, was contingent to you working in St. Cloud. Is this still a possibility? Yeah. Yeah, I've been in communication with the two clients that were my repeated clients out in St. Cloud. Yeah. Okay. Then my other piece to it, because the requirement from what I'm looking at in the contract, or not a contract, but the agreement between you and AVAC was that you would be working in St. Cloud due to that pay increase that was instilled for the payroll. Are these two things something that you can be responsible for? Yeah. I guess I do want to kind of clarify just so to avoid any future disappointment, does this mean that he wants me to work in St. Cloud like Monday through Friday, like every single day? Or am I still allowed to keep my repeat clients that I have out here in the cities? My understanding is that the pay increase was contingent to you being in St. Cloud. Like just period. The clients have nothing to do with that, unless you are able to maintain clients within Mora, Minnesota. So Mora or St. Cloud, but no Minneapolis? So Mora, St. Cloud was because of that pay increase that you had asked for. The agreement between you and AVAC was that you would be working in St. Cloud. He's mentioned that he really was looking forward to me working in St. Cloud. He's brought it up a couple of times. Yeah, there's a very high need in St. Cloud. That is why. Your phone cut out. What did you? There's a high need in St. Cloud at this time. Okay. Yeah. I definitely, I just, I can definitely work in St. Cloud. I just want to make sure that I'm so I guess I'm sorry. I just need somebody to tell me, like, am I allowed to like have people like in Minneapolis or keep the clients, some of the client load that I have or just work in St. Cloud? I would state that. All right. If your folks in the city need support from someone in the cities, then coordinate with me to have a secondary peer be the main peer for them. And then the direction that I'm giving you is that we would like you to be working in St. Cloud. Okay. All right. Very forward. Okay. Okay. Thank you. That is very helpful. Sorry. I had to like ask you to repeat that a couple of times. I just needed to make sure that it was clear for me. That's okay. It's okay. I think like questions are always good. Like we're a community. You hear me? So that's just a part of the process. But, okay. Any questions, concerns, comments? So, all right. So I should start. So the clients are in St. Cloud. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I should start. So the clients that I plan on working with in the, or that I have been working with in Minneapolis, I should work with Miles and some of my other coworkers to start to find secondary or new primaries for them or to transition them to somebody else's care. So that you can be able to support them as may be down the line and then transition to fully being in St. Cloud. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

I don't fucking come over to people's houses that I don't fucking talk to first. Oh. And by the way, I've got a bunch of running around to do so now I finally get that. Yeah. Oh my god. Are you smoking? Yeah. Oh my god. That's terrible, dude. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I guess. My plan was if I can come over and kick it like today and tomorrow. Now you're probably just gonna have to wait until fucking Monday if I'm gonna come out to her. Oh yeah, I guess you don't have a vehicle. I'm sorry. Yeah. You're all the way up north. I forgot. Yeah. You know, you're more than welcome to come out here and get a hotel room. Yeah. You want me to tell you how my day went today? I do. How did your day go? I worked till five o'clock. Which is like an hour later than you usually do. No, I worked my normal time. But as soon as I got off of work, I had to fucking run home and then I had to go meet a couple people and then I had to fucking come all the way out to Zimmerman and then fucking I went and stopped at my friend's house and then I went to Walmart and I'm just finally getting done now and I'm so exhausted. I can't wait to go to bed. Yeah. So like you would have had to do all that running around with me and. No, I wouldn't have. I'd be fucking sitting at home. I'd be sitting at your place because yeah, when you go to work. Yes. I just like touching all my shit. No, I wouldn't actually be. I most of the time if I'm down in the cities, I can work. I'm just kidding. I want you to be. I want you to be my own body. I need to cook me food and be a wifey. That's what I'm saying. I was thinking if I come back, I'd like get some groceries for the week and fucking, yeah, just kind of be like your homie. Yeah, you can't. You can't fucking get a ride out or a fight. What are you talking about? Yeah, of course I can. What do you mean like tonight? No, not tonight. Tonight's too late. But like, yeah, on like Monday or even maybe even like Sunday night, I'd probably get dropped off. Why not tomorrow? Well, because on Sunday I go and I, Sunday's like my family day where I go and like all my kids meet up with each other and you know, we like have dinner. We do that every Sunday. That's cool. Yeah. So you're saying you don't want to leave for the week or get stranded? What are you talking about? No, I am going to be, I'm going to be stranding, I'm going to be stranding myself there Monday through Friday. Yeah. Yeah. And if for some reason you get sick of me, I got, I got other people in the area Yeah. Yeah. But the thing is, you have to answer your phone. Yeah. Oh yeah. And then I, and then I switched into a new phone. So my phone was down for a while because I don't get text messages and I don't ever go on fucking Facebook or Messenger. And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I just, like, you have to call me. Okay. I'm sorry. I know I feel bad. I feel bad. But I just, I avoid the social media like the plague that every once in a while, I'd be like, Oh yeah, I got that thing about social media and I'll go back on it. I'm sorry. Yeah, no, I too am not, I don't use social media. Like, I basically use it so other people can get a hold of me. Yeah. So what's that? What else is up with you? Just been kind of a little bit more stressed out lately. Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just tired. I'm on these meds and they just make me tired all the time. What kind of meds? Stuff to help you with your bipolar? Yeah, pretty much. Antipsychotics. Are you for real? Yeah. It makes me really tired. Why are you laughing? And I'm getting fat. Because you're right. Yeah. I mean, what does a psychologist or some doctor give them to you? What are they? Oh yeah, because I think I'm crazy. Expand. I went through a little issue where I felt like there's bugs all over me, which I still believe there was, but I don't know, they call it like Margillis disease or Margillis disease. Something like that. You have to Google it. So, I mean. I got really depressed there for a while and I was really stressed out and I think that triggered it. And you're. And I'm allergic to something that makes me feel like that where my skin just felt like it was crawling. Yeah, yeah. I remember like when you were still living in Elk River, you were saying something about like, you know, you touched the insulation and you just fucking. Yeah, well, I thought it was fiberglass. Yeah, well, no, I cleaned some metal fucking old tin thing off because it was like an old tool thing and I was like covered in all these like tiny little hairs, like microscopic hairs. I didn't know what it was, so I just assumed it was fiberglass. But now I'm trying to think that maybe it was like some sort of fucking bug or parasite or something. I don't know. So, are any of these, like, so have you been experiencing these symptoms while like completely sober or some like uppers have anything to do with it or not that I'm disappointed? Yeah, sure. Sure they did or do. Yeah. Is it something you've been getting into like consistently? Well, yeah, I mean, like I quit for like three or four days and it was still happening. So, I mean, it is what it is. And I started medicating myself, anti-parasite meds, and I was seeing things come out of my body that were just fucking disgusting. And it felt like there was something in my ear. I was ready to kill myself. And some things did come out of my ear, but no one will believe me. I still have them too. Yeah. Yeah, and it was just terrible. It was like the worst time of my life and no one would believe me. And doctors thought I was crazy and they were about to put me in the psych ward. But like my ear was clearly there was something in there and they just would not. They just they're like clearly it's swollen and all that. They said that I was making it up in my head, which was making my ears swell up and look like that. I'm like, you guys are fucking dumb. But I took the anti-parasite meds and I started feeling a little better and feeling like, you know, whatever. And then for shits and giggles, I just was like, OK, fine, I'll take your fucking meds. Because when they told me I could have Morgellons disease, I had like fibers coming out of my skin. The more I looked into it, the more I Googled it, the more I believed them. And hands down, I come in a couple of support groups and stuff that it for sure is everything that I'm experiencing or have experienced is exactly what like these thousands of people all experience. So I have shits and giggles. I started taking these meds and we're on the same time as the parasite meds. So I don't know which one is working and which one's not, but it's working. Yeah. So this is like so like the peak of this. So I mean, so it started so like the whole fiberglass thing, I remember was probably like close to like five or six months ago. And I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Five or six months ago now, but it kind of you're saying the whole thing kind of peaked about two, three months ago. And now, like, since your meds are kind of starting to balance out, I think you've kind of felt pretty normal the last like month or so. Yeah, pretty much in a nutshell. Yeah, it's all been going on since like May 10 is when I when I quit my job and all pretty much high related stress. And that was around the time where I had that incident with all the tiny little hairs. And then around that time, I was bit in the ear by something. And yeah, just all these things happened at once. And I don't know what to blame it on. But there most definitely was something in my ear. And but it looks like fucking it looks like thread, threadworms. Yeah, that's what they look like. And I was like constantly being attacked by like these silvery hairs. I see. And they were everywhere, like everywhere I went. And it's like, I know. And I was pulling hair out of my ears constantly. Yeah, like long hairs, long, long hairs that aren't supposed to be in there. And the second I touch them with like my bare skin, my skin burn. Like I like I got contact dermatitis from it. And when you are like allergic to something or whatever, like you can get the creepy crawlies. Yeah. Yeah, it was like the worst. Probably worse than prison. I don't know. Pretty comparable. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Yeah, like, again, I'm sorry that you had to experience all that. Not to like, I mean, it does kind of make. So in comparison, like, I mean, I guess obviously my troubles aren't exactly like that. But I did. I don't know. So like right around like fucking October. Yeah, like the beginning of October. Basically, I don't know. Kind of like when my transmission went out of my truck. Like there was like a few days where because like at first, so like the transmission went on my truck and then like I was like trying to fix the transmission like while it was like still down in the cities. And then my truck ended up getting vandalized. And then I moved it. I had it moved to like, you know, up north. Like I towed it from like the cities to up north. And I started and I fixed the transmission, redid the transmission at somebody's garage. So I mean, all the all that like took place and like probably about five or six days. And I didn't even really realize it. But like those five or six days, like I was like off of my meds. And I totally didn't even fucking think about it. But like, you know, I eventually brought my truck back to here in Mora. And I don't know. Then it kind of became like a little bit of a money pit. And long story short, like I fucking like just became so incredibly like depressed, like, I don't know, like, I don't know, just totally lost, lost for life, like hopeless, you know, just not firing all cylinders, like couldn't get out of bed. And like, I couldn't like fix myself. Like it wasn't just my normal self. And that was going on for probably like, I don't know, like close to two months. And like, it got like so bad. I was like starting to think to myself, I'm like, shit, dude, like, am I like bipolar? Like, do I need to like go into the doctor and like, fucking like start talking, having these sort of conversations? Like, am I like, do I have like some long fucking diagnosis that I've never really addressed or something like that? But then I like started taking my meds, my ADHD medicine again. And yeah, within like four or five days, like I started to kind of feel like my normal stuff self again. And yeah, so I mean, so yeah, probably about like last like three or four weeks, like I've been like feeling back to normal, but I had no fucking idea like what coming off of that medicine would fucking do. Like, it's crazy. Yeah, I don't know. It really had me fucked up. Like, because I like, I go to therapy and all that shit. And I don't know, I wasn't even going to therapy for a little bit there just because I was like, just so fucked up. But I feel better now. But I was like, really close to like checking myself in. Yeah, I like I had to take leave from work. Like, yeah, because I was like, just definitely not even fit to go to work. Now I'm good. Yeah, but now I'm good. Yeah, I'm good, too. But I'm so tired all the time, even when I'm up, I'm tired. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, I see. But I'll give you some Adderall and see if that fucking helps. All right. Oh, I got Adderall. I always prescribe Adderall. Well, he doesn't want to prescribe me Adderall anymore because he thinks that's what made me go crazy. Oh. Oh, sorry. So yeah, well, I mean, that does that would make sense. Honestly, chemicals work differently in everybody. Like, I don't know, over the years, like when it came to like smoking dope and all that stuff, like I always kind of counted myself blessed because like some of the normal symptoms that people get, like are some of those side effects like that I never got. Like, I never get like paranoid or like, I don't know, some of the other side effects that come along with it. I don't know. I feel like my body is like one of those, but like I need like that stimulant. Otherwise, I don't know, I'm just, I don't know, totally in a wheelchair without it, to be honest. Like, I can't do a lot of things that I want to do, like computer work. Like, I don't know, I can kind of gauge myself. Like, yeah, I don't know if I'm not, if I don't, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of a long story, but I'm glad that you're doing much better. I'm glad that I'm doing better. I know that our things aren't very comparable because you probably sound like you've been kind of through a lot more. Yeah, it's been crazy. That's for sure. So what are you on your way back home right now or what? Yeah, trying to figure out how to get my contacts back on my phone without backing up all my data from my old phone. Use up all my data. You have an iPhone? Yeah. And you don't want to put on, you don't want to put your old Google account back on your phone or something? I did, but I just don't know how to put on my, get my contacts out of Google. How do you do that? Well, if you still have your old phone, then you just got to like sync like your Google account, like whatever it is, like on your iPhone. It's like, I know on an Android phone, like all I have to do is like go into my Google account settings and then like hit back up. And I'm assuming that you probably could do the same thing on an iPhone, like go to your Google account. And then once you put that, the same Google account on a new phone, like it, once everything syncs, then the contacts and like your emails and your calendar stuff, like goes back on the new phone. Yeah. See, I tried to back up my phone, but it was taking like four or five hours. Oh, really? Yeah. Like I was so close to being all the way out of data. I couldn't even take any photos and my phone slowed down so much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I don't know. And that's probably another thing. Like the downside about iPhones is like with your iCloud, like all your photos, like they either like take up room on your phone or they take up room in your iCloud. And with Google Photos, like if you just open up Google Photos and like sync it with that, then you can actually like free up all your space that your photos and all your stuff would be taken up. Because I have like, I have like 300 gigs of like pictures and videos and all that shit. But I, yeah, I obviously couldn't keep that all on my phone. I have to have it up in a cloud. Yeah, I got like probably the same like 4,000 photos. It's on my iPhone, but that's just a little sassy taking so many pictures of my ear, right? So you have like 1,000 photos of your fucking ear? Yeah, and all the bugs that I was seeing. Yeah, damn. Yeah. Huh. Just let them run. Still, that's like 45 minutes away. Yeah. That is. What? Oh, what? No, no. Zoom in. Well, you said you were in Zoom in earlier, but now you're on your way back to Minneapolis. Yeah, I just got back. Good. Oh, good enough. I'm doweling Avenue North. Okay. Close to north side. I could fucking spit, spit over north. Yeah, like it was. Yeah. Sure. I miss you. Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, I fucking miss you. Why, Anne? I can't believe you don't have a car. Huh? I can't believe you don't have a car or a ride or you can't steal someone's vehicle and do that. I can't believe you don't have a car. I can't believe you don't have a car. I can't believe you don't have a car. I can't believe you don't have a car or a ride or you can't steal someone's vehicle and use it for the night or tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I kind of have to like plan, plan things accordingly, which is kind of shitty. Yeah. I could, I could get dropped off on Sunday night because that, that would make sense. Because I have to drive through the cities because I'm going to Rochester on Sunday. And then I could like make arrangements to just get dropped off Sunday night. That way I'm like, like in the cities and you know, available for work on Monday. Oh yeah. Oh. Oh, you're supposed to trust you're not going to bring anyone over to my house. Oh, I'm dumb. I'll be. No, it's fine. Yeah, you, you, you broke that last time I told you not to get anyone in my car. Oh my God. You're such a female, dude. Like. Yeah. Never forget anything. Well, that's how we go. I should be able to bring all the crackheads to your house. I feel like after all, that's who I work with. Is it? Well, I mean, people in recovery that is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's not worth me working with people that are still fucking. But actually that's, that's kind of what the idea is. It's not, you, it's not worth me working with people that aren't sober, but what I've found out getting into this is it's actually kind of frequently frequent that like, you know, I'll work with somebody that's like an alcoholic that like, you know, they don't really have much success in complete abstinence. So, I mean, they'll sometimes I'll like meet up with them and they'll like be under the influence. They're not like sloppy drunk or anything like that. But I had to like talk to my supervisors about it. I'm like, yeah, this is kind of something I wasn't expecting. Like, and I kind of just made rules for myself. Like if, so if there's like somebody that I'm going to work with that like their drug of choice is like meth, then like I make like rules for myself where I'll like, like I'll only meet with them like at the office because I have an office like probably like six blocks away from, you know, 10 blocks away. I don't know. It's on like 12th and Harmon. Y'all, y'all know where that is? 12th and Harmon? Yeah. Yeah, I'm like so close to 12th street. Yeah, yeah, because if you live over by Derek, then yeah, I know, I know where you live. Yeah, you're like. Well, I live right next to the Lowry bridge. Yeah, yeah. So you are, yeah, you're probably not even 10 blocks away from my office. Yeah. What treatment center is it? I don't work for a treatment center. I work for, they call it an RCO, like a recovery community organization called Generation Hope. So yeah, I have like an office like right in town that I bring people to, but I don't know, typically that's typically like if I just, if I'm like worried that they're going to be high. Otherwise, you know, I'll meet, I'll like meet them wherever in town, you know. Yeah, it's most definitely not safe for you to come around me then. If I can come around you wherever I feel like, come on, whatever I feel like. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, and I feel guilty. I didn't go see my mom. I live right across here from Psycho Susie's, or the old Psycho Susie's. I guess it was spelled out. Oh, I know you don't. The big Ferris, the big Ferris wheel at the Lowry bridge, like, I mean, that's your apartment. Send me your fucking address, dude. It's 20 Lowry. Okay, hold on a second. And right on Lowry. Can I unlock my phone? I guess super cool, they're a cute apartment. And I got a gym in my basement, or in the downstairs, that bike room, and other bikes. Okay. Oh, yeah, dude, that's right. I've, wait a second. Fuck. This is not where I thought you lived at all. Or wait a second. Why is this my, my fucking shit upside down? Uh, oh, okay. 20 Lowry Northeast. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, you'll be pretty proud of me. I got all my old shit now. I just went and spent a bunch of 100 bucks at Walmart, and got a new car. I spent a bunch of 100 bucks at Walmart again. Every time I go, it's just a couple hundred bucks. I wanted to get new trash cans, even though I got a million trash cans. But I had to get ones with lids on them. Me and Andy ran out of gas on this, on this bridge. Can you hear me? Oh, shit. Oh, hello. Yeah. All right, can you hear me? Yeah, sounds like you. Okay, that's fine. I'll talk to you soon, okay? All right, bye.","strategic_notes":"{\"title\":\"Personal Visit Coordination and Health Catch-up\",\"summary\":\"Rebecca and Brandon discuss their recent mental health experiences, medication management, and histories with substance use.

Wrong number. Are you serious? No, uh, where I do, I just started watching the show. I was fucking talking. I'm just kidding. Sorry. Uh, no, I just started with this new show. It's called unbelievable. Have you ever heard of it? No. Was it? Um, is it like, like people surviving or something? No, no, no, no. It's a, it's about, uh, um, I just starts out with this, this rape scenario, rape victim, and then like how she's coping with it. Oh, that's the girl that like dialed with her toes and stuff. Yeah. And they like said that she was lying. It turned out she was, didn't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking Gabby started watching the show. Like, I don't know, a couple months ago, I remember I was like really high and I was like really not interested in fucking, but then she fell asleep and it was like playing while I was like up, up, I was all cracked out. And, and, um, I don't know, as I was watching it, I kind of started to get kind of interested because like one of the detectives in there, uh, was just kind of like, I don't know, I don't know something about this person's character. I was like, yeah. So I mean, I started kind of getting into it, but like by the time I started becoming interested, I was like already like the fifth or sixth episode. So I just started watching it from the first episode and I'm like, I'm like the third or fourth episode now, but it's pretty good. That sounds like you've already heard of it because you have, because you have no life. You know what? Speaking of having no life, I'm going to go hang out with somebody tonight. I don't even know why I doubted you. Shut up. Hold on. Ashton wants to say something to you. Dad. Hey, what's up? Can I come over for Christmas? Can I come over for like a portion of Christmas break? Yeah, sure. I don't care. Okay. Mom's going on a date with a guy named Jordan. She met him up in. Yeah. He looks like Morgan Wallen. Sure. Okay. He's 31. Ashton, do you mind? Yeah. Well, at least he's not African-American. And I would say something about her. What would be wrong if he was African-American? I don't know. Only chick. Only big chicks date African-Americans. That's not even true. Anyway. Those are social security numbers. I don't know. Oh, no. Dad's 478-11-6286. Not quite, but close. It's not? What is it? 786-6786-427-11-6786. 67? Fuck my dad. We had 1738. My attention span is short. My attention span is short. So let me talk to your mom. Okay, what? Do you have me on fucking speakerphone or what? Not anymore. Why are you need to talk to me about something private? No, what? Yeah, no, no. Fucking just fucking shut up. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so what the fuck is Ava's deal? So I don't know. It's kind of fucking pissing me off. Like, not quite severely, but enough that it's irritating the fuck out of me. So I don't know. We're not shit talking. I just dad's asking me about you. And I'm not really trying to have you sit right next to me listening. It's awkward. Yes, about what school? Yeah, well, yeah. So I mean, yeah, she I mean, like, she opened up to me. She's not really giving me a straight answer. Like, I've tried speaking to her about it, too. She doesn't want to go to Ogilvy. It doesn't sound like but she doesn't hasn't said she actually really want that she wants to stay go down here either. She's like, I just don't know what I want. And I know that. Like, I need to make a decision or whatever. But I know that, like, when we spoke about her, if she were to potentially come down here, she's very like, worried about you being like upset with her thinking that she's abandoning you. So I mean, okay, so and I'm told, I guess, I was kind of like, I don't know, because I assumed that she may have spoken with you a little bit more in depth than she has had with me. For some reason, I was Yeah, the only reason I haven't like made like, just like went out and did it completely. Because it was because I assume that you may have more information than I do. But kind of, well, you don't have to. I mean, she has spoke to me more about it. But I mean, I thought she probably already shared those things with you. Is that not correct? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm not hearing anything that I haven't heard yet. And I ultimately, like, what I've like, kind of determined is, you know, like, you know, her main concern about not wanting to go to, you know, more high school is ultimately because of that, like, bad social encounter that she had. And I was like, you know, being receptive of that, but still encouraging her, you know, like, you know, it would be silly to assume that you can't make friends anywhere. And that and like, if you have like some sort of phobia about something, like, not that your fears aren't valid, but you should probably learn to overcome those and not let them, like, you know, form how you're, you're like, make your decisions. And so I mean, that's like, basically what I was like, trying to get her to lean into. And, and then when she's like, okay, well, and so I was like, being receptive of that. So I was like, okay, so obviously, we need to get you into school full time, you know, and back to your interacting with your peers, because I see that, you know, I described to her like the, you know, the potential downsides of like, not being as social and like, not interacting, because I was like, you know, when you become an adult, like your survival is dependent on interacting with people. And if you like learn to like, be like reclusive, and like, you're not building your social skills, then you're going to really damage your chances of success as an adult. And, yeah, so anyway, so, but that being said, I was like, okay, so, all right. I mean, I feel like, oh, I understand you don't like if there's another option besides more high school, you know, me being receptive of your feelings, I'll see if there's another option that's, you know, doable, and that makes sense. So I did find this, that Ogilvy is only like, like, it's like six and a half or seven miles away. And there is a bus that like, comes and gets her and drops her off and everything. And, and it's only four days a week. And yeah. Yeah. So okay, like, I know, she kind of, well, she didn't tell me all of that. But she told me that, like, kind of what it seemed like, what I've gathered from what she told me is that she knew that you like had, like, you had talked to her about the Ogilvy thing. But like, it was in her mind, like, she shared with you, like how she was feeling. And then you just went and did it and like, didn't even really like include her and like, talking about like, hey, this is what we're gonna do kind of thing. I think she felt kind of blindsided by it. And so like, I'm not even entirely sure if it's Ogilvy itself is like the problem, or if it's just like her feeling like you didn't care about what she thought and like just did it much like I've told her like, you know, as being like a parent, like you're not like in being the child, you're not going to always have like the final say in things like that. Ultimately, it's our decision what's best for you. But yes, like we want to take into consideration like your thoughts and feelings about things. But, um, you know, and I told her the same thing, like, just because she had a bad experience at Mora doesn't mean that just because it's a small school that she's guaranteed to have a bad experience at Ogilvy too, you know, like, I'm not just over here, like shit talking everything that you're doing. But I also felt kind of like blindsided and not really, you know, like, I feel like we try to do these things like as a team. And you kind of just did that. And just, I found out about it, like through the grapevine kind of thing. Yeah, I don't know. Well, I mean, I told her, told her exactly what I was going to do. I mean, it's silly that she says she's blindsided. I don't know. And like, when I did tell her, you know, okay, I found Ogilvy, you know, like, I'm gonna get like, you're basically signed up. I like started signing her up. But like, you know, there's still like more phone calls that need to be made. And I told her that she was signed up. And then she's like, well, didn't you talk to mom? And I was like, well, yeah, but I don't know. I didn't. That's why it kind of made me stop. And I was like, assume that there was something more to it than what you may have told me or something like that. Or maybe she had made some arrangement with you. I was like, well, what the fuck? So I don't know, I kind of felt like whatever she's... No, we never made like a... Sorry. Go ahead. Well, no, like we never made like some like arranged plan or anything like that. But like, when we spoke that night, like the first time we talked about all this, it was like, she was like, I don't want to go to a small town school. Like, I don't want to go to Mora. Like dad talked about possibly Ogilvy, but like, I don't want to go there. And I'm like, so what are you like, what are you trying to do then? Cause I'm like, if you're not going to go, if you don't want to go up there, like the other option would be to come down here. And I'm like, so like, you need to decide what it is that you like want to do. And then we can kind of go from there. But, but then we're like, I brought it up to her after like, you had like, she had said you'd signed her up for Ogilvy. Like, and we even spoke about it briefly last night. Like, she just, I don't know if she even knows what she wants. And I feel like it might be a good idea to just like, have a conversation, like with me, you, her, like Gabby, whatever. And just like, try and like really understand like what's going on, what she wants to do and like, go from there and not saying that she has the final say. But I think that if we like, I don't know. Cause like, I know that you talked to her about Ogilvy, but she said that it was just kind of like a brief, like you, she knew you never said that's for sure what was happening. So just like kind of, I think including her in the process might be helpful just because I think because she does have so much anxiety around it feeling like feeling very like out of control of the situation. I think like just trying to include her and it might help with those fears and anxieties, if that makes sense. I don't know. So here's my kind of fucking final thoughts on the subject is I feel like we're kind of fucking ourselves as parents and making our jobs harder than it has to be given her the illusion that she has a fucking say at all, because in retrospect, when we first made this arrangement with her to do online school, we told her right then, if she doesn't fucking live up to these standards and hit these fucking, these expectation marks, then this is exactly what's going to happen. So the fact that we even offered her to like, have like feelings or say in it at all is probably us just being good parents. And I feel like that at this point, that's being taken advantage of with her, assuming that she has a fucking choice at all. Well, I understand what you're saying, like where you're coming from. But I think that even if she doesn't have like the final say, like, I think it's still important to like, listen to like her, not just her, but all of the girls and like, you know, if they feel a certain way about something, not saying that that's how it's going to be. But like, like I said, just kind of including them in the process, or even if like, you've already made that decision that that's what's going to happen, then still like talking with her about it. And like, you know, just explaining and like, I don't know, just not just being like, this is what's happening. This is we're doing it. And like, that's that, like, yeah, granted, you can do that. But like, So this is, so this is what I'm saying, like, that did take place, like, we did sit down and like, Hey, how you feeling, feelings, you know, thoughts, whatever. So I mean, I, I think we've both done that. And I don't think we need to worry about continuing to do that, because we're already doing, we're already like, checking in, making assessment, collecting feelings, collecting thoughts, sharing thoughts, having those conversations, we're, we're hitting all those boxes. And I feel like, I don't know, the fact that it's been two weeks, I've been getting text messages from, like her school saying that, you know, she's not in attendance. She's like, basically dropped out on her own volition. Like I've been getting those text messages for like two, two and a half weeks now. And like, yeah, I mean, that's like, I don't know, that's bullshit. We've let a lot of that happen. I agree. And I mean, I spoke, I told her that too, that like, that whatever happens, it needs to happen like ASAP, because I'm not trying to have what happened with CPS happen again. And like, because we didn't have you in school. I'm like, I'm quite honestly, it terrifies me to like ever have be in the position to lose them again. That's what Gabby says too. So, I mean, if anything, if there's anything that I feel like needs to change, it's Ava that needs to, I mean, because Ava should have brought this to our attention fucking a month ago, a month and a half ago. I agree. I told her that as well. And also I think though that what taken into account, like, she's obviously a kid and she's going to make mistakes, but she was really scared to tell us because she thought that we were going to be really upset with her because of how hard she pushed to do online school and then she wasn't being successful in it. And like, yeah, I understand, like, you know, logically, it makes sense to like, okay, you're struggling, talk to us. But also I like completely understand where she's coming from, even though I'm like, you know, I've never been like, like angry if you're like not doing well about something like I'm always pretty calm and like so in the future, like if you are struggling, you need to tell us before it gets to the point where you're so far behind that you can't do anything about it. Yeah. I mean, I said the worst that's gonna happen is we're gonna like have to talk to you and we're gonna have to figure out what needs to happen to get me get you back on track. But no one's gonna tell you you're a piece of shit, you know? Yeah, I mean, that's what I basically was saying to her too. I mean, that night that we talked, you know, we have like a really good conversation really great. I mean, the lights were all off, which was, I don't know, a little weird, but you know, and at some point, I even like, excuse myself and went and got some fucking napkins or tissues so she could wipe her tears and because I'm a fucking sweetheart. Yes, Brandon, you're so sweet. Yeah, but now I'm just like, listen here, dude. We, we, I mean, I'm pretty confident that you're all about Oh, feelings, this feelings that but like, Yes, I am. And like, I'm not, I'm still I'm still a parent. And I don't want you to fucking think that my I'm being cross in this but like, I mean, I feel like because I've already like did all those feelings talks feelings this, what are your thoughts? What do you want me to fucking, you know, I do I did all that. I mean, I, I'm not kidding. I'm, I don't think I'm being too cross and being like, Okay, like we heard everything. Okay, but now this is what's happening. I mean, the fact that I don't think that's out of line either. I just think it's, yeah, I just think it's a matter of just like cluing her in on what's happening, like as it's happening kind of thing that like play by play necessarily but yeah, like we'll sit and we'll talk with her and tell her like, Okay, we heard everything you're saying, but this is what we're gonna do. And, you know, I mean, you could remind her, I mean, you're, you're gonna probably talk to her obviously before I do but reminder that, you know, this isn't like a something that I just dropped on her because this is exactly I mean, when we originally talked, you know, if this didn't work out, it was going to be immediately going back into more high school. And the fact that I like, like, was putting her in a different school, that's me being considerate of our conversations that we had. So I mean, I know the fact that she's like, given, like, bucking that is a little frustrating for me because I'm like, What the fuck? You don't get to buy something. I'm just curious. Why are you so against like, if she would want to come down here with the girls and like all of them go to like the same school area? I mean, because to me, it is already kind of super apparent that you've got your hands full right now with the two of them. I mean, yeah, oh, that's what I wanted to tell you, too, because that's what you told her. And she was like, very, I could tell she was very, like, upset by that. Because, like, I told her, I'm like, you know, it's never, I have three kids. At the end of the day, I have three kids and having all three of them is never like something I can't handle. Like, yes, it's stressful from times but like, that's what I signed up for when I had kids and like, her being here would never be a burden or like too much for me to handle. Well, I feel like for you to say that. That's the way that my words got twisted around to come to you, but because we were joking about it. I'm just saying in the future, like I would like if you would like, talk with me about these things too, because it did kind of frustrate me. No, I'm talking about like, when you just made the decision that she was going to Ogilvy and like, didn't talk to me about it or anything. That was frustrating. Before, I didn't know that you were even looking at Ogilvy until Ava told me you were signed, you'd signed her up for it. Like, I called you that one morning and talked to you about it. Would it have been a surprise if I fucking just signed her up for Mora and like, told her to fucking suck it up because that's what we originally told her was going to happen? Maybe because like, I don't know, I just, I try to like clue you in and keep you in the loop on things. And I feel like that's kind of just out of respect. And like, I would appreciate it if you could like do that for me as well. I feel like trying to fight with you. I feel like you should have just known that that's what was going to happen because we already talked about it. That's not like fair for you to say. I should just know, like, it's, I don't just know things all automatically. That's weird. I thought you were just supposed to know things. Oh my God. Whatever. FYI, Ella is grounded from her phone right now. What the fuck? What's that? How come you don't do the whole fucking, oh, well, call your dad. Because I don't know, every single time, every single time I've ever taken a kid's phone away, I'm like, okay, call your mom. It's the last fucking call you're going to get. Well, because it wasn't intended to go like this. It was supposed to just be like, so what happened was that she didn't do her chores. Like, and this isn't the first time that I've like asked her to do something and they don't do it. And like, I haven't made a super big deal about it yet, but we've like talked about it, whatever. Well, then tonight I came home and she did like the bathroom, but she didn't have her room clean. And like, I've still been making them have their room clean on Fridays. Cause that's what we all agreed upon earlier this year. And she didn't clean it. And she was just like laying in her bed on her phone. And I was like, okay, give me your phone. And she's like, I was like, no, like, well, yeah. And then I went back in there. I'm like, what are you doing? She's like, not cleaning my room. And I'm like, why not? She's like, well, I already lost my phone. I'm like, did it ever occur to you that I might give it back to you if you just did what I asked you to do? And then I don't know if it was when I was in the shower or what, but she just went after she cleaned her room. She just went and took her the phone. Back off the counter and didn't even speak to me about it. And in the meantime, I'd made dinner after working for 10 hours today. And she refused to come out and eat and was like being rude to me and wouldn't speak to me. So then I went back in there. I was like, cause I said something about her phone and Ava's like, oh, she's on her phone. And I was like, what? So I went in there and I tried to talk to her and she just stared at me and wouldn't speak. And then I was like, well, you need to speak right now. Otherwise you're just going to give me your phone back. So I'm pretty inclined to just take your phone for longer now, since you didn't speak to me. So I'm pretty inclined to just take your phone for longer now, since you just decided you were going to go take it back without even talking to me. And she's like, so I was like, okay. So I was like, so are you caring to make a case? And she just like did some whatever she was on her phone and then handed it to me. I was like, what are you doing? She's like, here's my phone. I'm like, so you would really just rather lose your phone for longer than just speak to me and have a conversation. She's like, yep, pretty much. I was like, okay, whatever. So that's where we're at with that. I was so pissed, dude. I wanted to punch her in the face. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Like, I just worked my ass off all day. Come home. Go to the grocery store after work. Come home. Make fucking homemade chicken fajitas for you to be like, no, I don't mean I can't eat that. I don't want that. And then just respect me and go and jack her phone back after I took it from her. Like, what? You got to be fucked up. Few things that's going to fly. So yes. And then Ashton, she was just got her phone back after not having it for a week from all that other stuff. But she didn't have that last weekend when you were over. But yeah, whatever. Now she has it back, but she can't remember her passwords. She's still locked out of it. Oh, yeah. Because that's right. When we were at the house, she fucking she's like, I just changed my password. And it was like this fucking 12 digit fucking password. Yeah. What a dumbass. Gabby has to bring her shit when she comes like for her computer so she can hook it up to it and like unlock it through her computer. But yeah. Anyways. Well, we can talk more about this later. I got to get I'm about to be leaving here in a minute. And I want to talk to the girls before I head out. But yeah, but no, I didn't. I would have had her call, but I didn't intend on her doing things the way she did. I thought I was just going to give it back to her when she was done cleaning and she got her attitude back on track. But no. Yeah. So I don't know. How long do you think I should take it from her? Like a day? Like a week. A week? Yeah. Yeah. Fucking disrespect is disrespect. Make an example. Ashton just lost her phone for a week for fucking smoking weed and vaping and shit. Not doing her chore. Well, disrespect is fucking paramount. I told her, I was like, when you just don't do what I ask and you just blatantly do whatever you feel like. I'm like, it makes me feel like you don't respect me at all. Yeah. I mean, let's add it all up. I mean, so that's disrespect, insubordination, fucking what do you call that? Like lack of communication, fucking bad attitude, like not following directions. Unappreciative. Yeah. And fucking disrespecting you for your fucking cooking efforts. I mean, all those things. Those are fucking things. Yeah. Yeah. I suppose. I see what you're saying. I feel like maybe five days would suffice. Yeah. Fine. But then, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, explain to her why that is and then encourage like, okay, I would like you to fucking consider the effort that it takes to make food for you guys. Consider what communicating could have done to make the situation better and fucking following the rules, all these other things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to talk about it with her tomorrow because she's clearly in no position to want to talk to me right now. Yeah. And on your part, great job. Sorry that this shit stresses you out. Also, I'd like that protocol kind of followed the same way I did it with you. If it comes up and like the thing that you got to take their phone away, like immediately, okay, call your dad and let them know. All right. Well, I think if you want that for me, then you should include me on decisions that you make as well. You can suck my ball sack. Like I will never touch your ball sack. You fucking asshole. Yeah. Right, dude. If I wanted you to lick my asshole, you probably would do it. You're disgusting. I'm not. Ava just goes, I could have gone the rest of my life without hearing you say that.

No, no, I was able to figure out that I'm most likely going to be staying with Phoenix. Okay. And Phoenix is sober as fuck. Yeah, Phoenix is also lonely and sent you kiddie pictures before.

Which is pretty sad to hear that. But I guess, like, when her dad caught up to him, he, like, fucking took the baby from him. And, like, just beat the hell out of him. Oh, my God. Is the baby okay? Yeah. Yeah. Jeez. Dude. I would literally never speak to that man ever again. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

Cause I see that she had called me and like left me a voicemail. Okay. Yeah. Um, do you know what she had needed on the voicemail? Did she state, or did she just say for you to give her a call back? Uh, she didn't even really tell me to give me a call, give her a call back, but she, uh, was, uh, something about an address. I had given her an address and, um, I think the address that I gave her was, uh, not, not valid. So I figured out what the address was, but I mean, uh, there was actually something else I had left in that voicemail, I think, maybe, but I can't really remember. Okay. Let me just, I'm going to get into your case here just to see if she case noted, um, just to see if I can answer those questions real quick.

We spoke last week. Um, Yeah. You left me a voicemail. Telling me that, uh, Yeah, it didn't come up. I can find it. So that it wasn't, um, Yeah. I, um, I got that address. The correct address. I was close, but I was not accurate. So it's 4114. 4114. Yeah. Gable. Like G-A-B-L-E. Lane. And although it's in Woodbury, it says that it's in St. Paul. Which I don't know what county that is. Ramsey, I think. Do you know the zip code? I don't. Okay. And we're only going to be at that address for probably like another, uh, until like basically Friday or Saturday. And then you're going to be going to Rochester. Okay. All right. So, yeah. All right. Do you have all the kids with you then? Or who's with you then? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All the kids are with me. Okay. And then in probably like 30 days, uh, that might change again. Because we might be, uh, starting the lease at that time. Okay. So where do you want me to, I mean, what. So, I just don't, I guess, know. Yeah, I mean, I'd still like you to, like, handle my case. I don't want you to, like, transfer it out until, like, I, like, I'm on the lease someplace. Right. So, um, because I was talking to my supervisor and, like, we, he was just kind of like, well, I just, because of the not knowing the address, I couldn't get ahold of you. So, he, I mean, we were kind of looking at possibly just doing a fraud referral so that we can get a verification about actually where everybody is. But, um, or who's here or who should be on. Because I look on the, on the healthcare case and there's only two kids that have healthcare, which are with her. And then you're on one by yourself. And then the other kids don't have any. Because the addresses are all different. Yeah. So, I don't know what. Well, yeah, the reason why that is, is because there was the CPS case that took, that started in, like, October of 2022. And, uh, the, my three daughters were removed for a while. They were with my mom. And then I got them back in January of 2025. And, um, yeah, I just actually learned recently, like, I learned, like, uh, last week or the week before that their insurance had lapsed. Because, uh, like I hadn't been getting any notification to reinstate it or whatever. So. Okay, so maybe they were on foster care or something like that? Yeah, yeah, because, yeah, because they were staying with my mom. They were with my mom for, like, almost, like, two years, you know. Like, almost three years, in fact. But, yeah, they've been, like, back with me since January of 2025. The case has been closed since June of 2025. Okay. And, um. So then you guys are staying overnight in the cities. Where do your kids go to school? Um, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. The two ones go to school in Woodbury. And then my oldest goes to, um, uh, their online school. Like, I think it's called Connections Academy. Okay, hold on. I want to just look up your case so I can get names. I know what I'm figuring out here. Um. Okay. Okay, so it's you, and then Ava and Ariella are online. Is that which one? Uh, are online. Could you rephrase the question? Can you tell me who's, you said, who's going to school where? Ava, where's Ava going to school? Connections Academy. Okay, and then Ariella? Uh, Woodbury. I have to double check the school. Their mom said it, so it's like Woodbury something. And Ashton? Same school. Woodbury? Yeah. And then Alexander? Uh, he's not in school. They're, they're. Not in school. Yeah. Yeah, they're a little too little for that. And then, uh, and then there's Atlas, who's also like too young for school. Not in school. So the one does online school and then the two go to Woodbury and you guys just bring them to school and then they're staying with you 24-7 or do they stay with their mom at all? Correct. 24-7. All, all five of them. You have them all? They don't have visiting time with their mother then? Uh, they do. But you sometimes stay there? Or like. Yeah, yeah, we do sometimes stay there. Okay. Because like that's the issue is like if they're on like health care with her, who's claiming them for taxes? Uh. Who's claiming all the kids? Are they all with the same mother or? No, they're with different, different parents. Okay. Okay. There's not even an absent parent panel in here. So whose parents is Ava, whose parents, who's the mother of all these kids? Uh, Kiana Stewart. Yeah. The three girls. Kiana? Yeah. Kiana what? Uh, Stewart. S-T-E-W-A-R-T. That's Ava, Ariel, and Ashton? Correct. And so they, and they stay with the mom sometimes or how often? No, we see them, we see their mom every Sunday. Okay. And where does she live? Rochester. Okay. And then, so is that where you're moving in with her next? Yeah, we're going to be staying with her for like probably like three weeks to four weeks. And then Alex and Atlas are the ones that have the mother that live up here? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, because the deal is that, the deal is that if they're like, if they're, if you're an intact family, then the mother would need to be like on the case. You know what I mean? Um, but so that's why like it's the St. Paul address. That's not with a parent, right? That's just. Yeah, no, that's a family friend. Yeah. Okay. Um. But then that's only till this weekend. Okay. Um, let me get my, are you going to be available? Can I just give my supervisor a call to find out what he wants me to do with the transfer or where to keep it or what to do with it? Sure.

So I need to transfer two prescriptions for two different people over to your facility. Are they at another Walgreens right now? No, the prescriptions are being held at Wellia Pharmacy in Mora, Minnesota. Okay, and they're open today? Yeah, they're open until noon today. Okay, and then have the two people gotten anything out of Walgreens before? Yes, they have before. Okay, what's the date of birth of the first person? 9-12-11. I do apologize, you cut out there. Oh, 9-12-2011. And what's her last name? Gillis, G-I-L-L-E-S. For Ariella? Yep. What is the most recent address? Because she has quite a few profiles. Most recent address is 130 Forest Avenue, Mora, Minnesota. But, you know, they're probably going to need to update that address when they come in and see you. Yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to find her profile in the Walgreens system real quick here. That one didn't pop up. What about between these four cities, what was the most recent one? Elk River, Ramsey, Anoka, or Minneapolis? Ramsey. Okay. You want me to tell you that address? Not at this second. I'm just trying to find her profile. Once the prescriptions pull over, they should have the address on there as well. I'm just grabbing all the info I need to give to the pharmacist so she can call over and transfer them. Okay. What's the date of birth of the next person? 6-6-13. For Ashton? Yep. Okay. Give me one second. I just have to grab something off the printer with their info on it. Then I'll grab the remaining info I need from you, like the pharmacy name, phone number, that sort of stuff. So I'll be back in just a moment. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. The next bit of info, are we taking everything they have over there, or are we just pulling over a certain thing? Everything? Yeah, everything. Okay. If things don't have a refill available, they won't be transferred over. Just to give you a heads up. Okay. Only prescriptions with refills can be transferred. Okay. So anything that doesn't have one will just need to be sent in to us directly from the doctor. Okay. All right. Is it possible you can give me a heads up on what does have a refill? We probably won't know that until you talk to them. Yeah, we won't know that until we talk to them and they send us over everything that does have refills. Okay. What's the pharmacy name? Well, it's called Willia, like W-E-L-I-A. And pharmacy in Mora, Minnesota, M-O-R-A. And do you have their phone number? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. One second. Okay. Is it? Oh, yeah, it's Willia Health. And then the phone number is 320-225-3999. Okay. And then do they need anything filled right now? Or are we just pulling it over and putting it on their profile until they need something filled? They do need stuff filled. Yes. Do you know what they need filled? One of them is like, so for Ariella, she has like some sort of acid reflux medicine that needs to be filled. And then... Like omeprazole or famotidine? Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. And then for Ashton, she has like some form of Zoloft that needs to be refilled. Perfect. All right. We'll call over there as soon as we can. And as soon as they send those to us, we'll get them pulled over here and get those two prescriptions filled for each of them. And then do you want notifications when their stuff is ready? Sure, sure. But I could also give you a different phone number. Yeah, for like the on-site parent that's going to be picking those up would probably be good. Yeah, whoever you want the notification to go to, I'll take their phone number. Okay. All right. One second. Okay. Okay. It's 763-620-4412. All right. So they'll get the notifications when we get these in. I want to say probably either later this afternoon, if not like tomorrow. It all depends on how long it takes that pharmacy to send them to us. Okay. Copy. But we will go ahead and get that process started. All right. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Have a good one. You too. Bye.

Do you know what you want for dinner? No. Okey-dokey. Dude, yeah, I went over to, like when I got back from dropping the boys off and stuff, Angelo called, or after I also finished court, but he called me to ask me if I could give him a ride to school. And I was like, yeah, I guess, like I have time to do that. And so I go over there to give him a ride and like this fucking huge-ass argument like fucking blows up between like Elijah, Angelo, and Dan. And that was so fucking awkward. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like they were basically like yelling at him, basically like almost kicked like, I don't know, like I already said, like, I'd move out, like grandma won't let me, blah, blah, blah. And he's like, fine. You want to fucking leave, then leave. And like, I don't know, Dan's kind of like, they're all low-key a little crazy. I was like, damn. And he was like, I'm sorry. You had to be here for that. And I was like, oh, it's okay. And then Vicki messaged me and she was just like, just so you know, like he's manipulating you and da-da-da-da-da. And then I was like, girl, what? And I was like, I just went to give him a ride. Like I didn't mind doing that. I understand he should be a little bit more responsible and wake up and go to school on time and take the bus. But like, it wasn't like he fucking like sent me some sob story that he like fucking didn't know when it was going to give him a ride. So that happened today. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I hope they don't fucking, I don't know, because I didn't I like responded to her like I was like, yeah, no, I understand. Like, it wasn't a problem. I didn't mind giving him a ride. Like, I agree, you know, you should be a little bit more responsible. And like, I figured, you know, he's just a kid, like having someone with like an outside perspective like to like, you know, talk to him about like, you know, respecting you guys a little bit more would be helpful, like blah, blah, blah. I'm just frustrated. And I was like, I didn't even respond because I was like, I'm I don't know, I'm not trying to have this conversation. Like, I'm not trying to be involved.

Yeah. Gosh, you're being manipulated. I know you are. I know. I am. I'm always, everyone's always manipulating me. Apparently, I'm very manipulative for manipulation. I don't know. I fall for manipulation easily. Apparently. Yeah. Gosh. Gosh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Gosh. I was like, I didn't know, asking your aunt for a ride and like, I don't know, I think they're just like up to wit's end with Angelo and so like anything he does, like just pisses them off, which like, I understand, but like, I also get that like, that's not like I'm condoning his behavior, but like, at the same time, like, I just know Angelo is like that kid. Like, you know what I mean? Like, you just don't want to like, argue with that kid. Like, he's just kind of dumb. Like, he's not like, Dan was like, Oh, yeah, that's a really good last word. And he's like, okay. And like, they were just like, arguing and I was like, honestly, everyone in this situation looks a little dumb. Because like, why are you a child arguing with your grandpa? Why is your grandpa, like an adult arguing with you? Like, I literally just like be like, you fucking think you're big and tough, like fucking pack your shit, leave, like end the story. But they were like, just arguing, like, almost like badass, almost like he was like, fucking taunting him too. Like, he's like getting all up in his face, like not Angelo, like Dan was getting in Angelo's face. And then like, Angelo was like, backing up a little bit. And he's like, Oh, are you scared? You know, he's like, No, I'm not fucking scared. I was like, Jesus Christ, what's going on here? Yeah. Yeah. Geez. It was like, full on, like, fucking domestic over there. I was like, and like, it all started with like, Angelo said some like, dumb ass remarks to fucking Elijah and Elijah got so pissed off and he like, literally was like, shut your fucking mouth and like, fucking slam the door like two or three times and I was like, dude, is it that serious? Like, what the fuck was that? And then he like, fucking comes back, like, because Katie came in and Katie was like, what's going on? And Elijah's like, that guy won't stop running his fucking mouth and blah, blah, blah. And then like, they all just started kind of like bickering. And then like, he like went outside and then Dan came inside with it. And like, you have a fucking respect problem, like you fucking don't respect anyone, da da da da da. And then Angelo just started going off too and I was like, what the fuck and I was just sitting there on the couch like, um, can I go home now? Can I call my mom? Mom? Can you pick me up? They're yelling. Yeah. Geez. So yeah. Also, Angelo's starting a business and I told him to reach out to you so you can help him with like his LLC and fucking, um, what else, um, trademarking stuff or whatever. And he was like, you know how to do that? And I was like, yeah, I know how to do it. And I was like, but Brandon taught me how to do it. And I was like, you can ask Brandon to help you. I'm sure he'd love to help you. And, um, he's like, oh, okay. And then he's like, I also, he's like, I need to get a shirt. And I started looking online for one and I was like, yeah, you could get some on Facebook marketplace. And he's like, yeah. And I need a cricket. And I was like, Brandon has a cricket. And he's like, shut up. Does he really? And I was like, yeah. And I was like, call Brandon. And it talks to him. Brandon would love, he would kick his feet to help you. I don't have feet. Yeah, you'd be kicking your little feet and giggling if Angela asked you to help. Shut up. He'd be like, I know how to do LLC stuff. I know how to trademark stuff. I got a cricket you can use. But yeah, you do some like decal fucking weird shit. So. I'm going to go into this Walmart and see if I can repeat, like got the wrong vinyls or something. And so he gave me the receipt and the two vinyls to see if I can return them. And then, um, and then, yeah, and then I'm going to grab, I don't know, whatever. You don't have any idea of what you want? Oh, I don't even know what you're talking about. Dinner. I'll just, don't we have more meat? Should we just eat more meat? And I'll just get like some mashed potatoes or something. Yeah, maybe. I'll grab some mashed potatoes and maybe like some asparagus. You like asparagus? No, I don't. I like green beans.

Even though you might not like it, or you will like it, it's being told to you. Okay. Okay. It is wild. So, basically, this guy told me he liked me on the third day of first day of school for me. There, at least. And I was like, okay, we can talk, but I want to date immediately. And then we were talking, and the second day we were talking, I found out that he just got off the talking stage. And he was like, you know, I don't like you. Yeah. Please. And he was like, not to me, but to this other girl he was talking to, he was like, I don't like you. I don't like your best friend. And I was like, what? That's what he said to you? No, to a different girl. Okay. And that same girl, I became friends with, and she told me that happened. I'm like, oh. And that was just like three days prior to me coming there. So I was like, oh, my God. So yeah, I told him I didn't want to talk to him anymore. And then he got pissed, and I guess that led to him spreading some crazy-ass rumors around about me. It was like so wild, too. Like the rumors were like illegal things, too. Yeah. Yeah, like the main one, like he made multiple, but like the main one that kind of like pissed me off the most. Like, sorry for my language, or, you know, you don't like me saying that, but like, whatever, whatever. It was saying like how I essayed a man, like, what? And he said, like, that's why, like, he kept on telling like almost every person in the school, like, hey, did you know that Ariella sexually assaulted a guy, and that's why she can't boys over? And like, he told one of my friends, and then like, she was like, how do you know? And then he said, she told me over text. And, um, yeah, and I'm like, what? I had never said anything relating to any of that, you know, text. And then he was like, you know, I stopped talking to her. I have screenshots of me saying I don't want to talk to him anymore. Like, bro. Yeah, that's crazy. It's like really weird. Like, yo, why is he so upset over something so petty? Like, take rejection, bro. Yeah. Hmm. What? Yeah, well, I mean, you're one thing that you're going to have to get used to, boys your age, not having the same maturity level as you. I guess. What's your thought? Um, I don't know. Basically what I just said. I mean, I wouldn't expect, I wouldn't expect other people, other boys to be as rational as you are. And, you know, to behave correctly, because guys just don't know how to act right until they're like 40 years old. Like you. Yeah, sure, dude, I'm not even 40 years old and I can't get it right. See what I'm saying? Huh? You see what I'm saying? I guess. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to talk to the counselor or principal on Monday about that, Brandon. Yeah. Because that's like, it's not just like being mean or like kind of starting a stupid rumor. That's like a criminal offense that he's trying to spread. That's like serious. And plus you've got boys bullying me. Like, it'd be different if it's like girls playing me, but having a whole different gender bullying me and trying to like hit me is different. Like, what? Yeah. Yeah. Like I'm new and like, let me live. Yeah. And you're not like egging us on yourself. No, I don't want drama. And I seen the message, the messages between them.

I sent it to one of the people who have a crush on me. Well, hopefully the police. Oh, no, I sent it to one of my friends who have a crush on me. I gotcha. Yeah, so what's the plan for tomorrow? What? So what's the plan for tomorrow? I don't know. That's why I was trying to talk to you earlier today. Get your fucking foot out of my face. Cheers, man. I need you to bring the kids medication or have it transferred because that needs to happen. You haven't done it yet. No, I can't remember. I know I started doing it, but then I got distracted with something else. Okay, well, they need to get back on their medication, specifically Ashton. Yeah. Yeah. She's acting crazy. No, but it's just you can't just take antidepressants all willy nilly and like be gone in one day and off in the next. It's just like it's not good for her. And she's been feeling irritable and tired all the time, which are signs of depression. But also, I don't know. Maybe if you guys wanted to come down here tomorrow, we could hang out at the house. I'm like super broke right now. Me too. Did you ever get that money from her beer or that other place? No. No, I haven't yet. Did her beer ever follow up with you again saying like if they got it approved or anything? No, I haven't. I haven't talked to her or heard from her since we talked to her that one day, which how long ago was that? That was like a month ago now, right? Yeah, at least. Because that was before I moved here. Yeah. Yeah. Here a month ago. I just paid rent. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. But I'm tired. I just got my pick them up right after. Well, Ashton has a friend spending the night that she met at school and then her friend's grandma works at Taco Bell. So, she told us to come up and get the kids food and she just gave me like half off like her discount or whatever. So, I picked them up right before I even came inside from work. So, I'm like just getting home and changing. I want to relax and watch some movie or something. Yeah. So, I don't know. Do you want to talk to Gabby and see what she thinks? And then if you guys come down here, I can probably get like some stuff to make something for dinner or something. I don't know. Right on. Okay. All right. Did you get the truck fixed yet? No, I got to get a new tranny. I had a chance to get a different tranny, but like there was no guarantee that it was going to like be a working transmission. So, I declined to get it. And now I just need to wait a couple more days till I can afford to get a working one. Okay. Yeah. All right. Yeah, I guess just talk to Gabby and see what you guys think and then we'll go from there. I'm not done talking to you. All right. Well, Ella's not done talking to you, but I am. Okay. All right. Goodbye. Bye. Allie! So. You can follow me. Pleasure. Pleasure. Hello. Dada. Yeah, what's up? I'm here to talk about school trauma. Even though you might not like it, or you will like it, it's being told to you. Okay. Okay. It is wild. So, basically, this guy told me he liked me on the third day of first day of school for me. There, at least. And I was like, okay, we can talk, but I want to date immediately. And then we were talking, and the second day we were talking, I found out that he just got off the talking stage. And he was like, you know, I don't like you. Yeah. Please. And he was like, not to me, but to this other girl he was talking to, he was like, I don't like you. I don't like your best friend. And I was like, what? That's what he said to you? No, to a different girl. Okay. And that same girl, I became friends with, and she told me that happened. I'm like, oh. And that was just like three days prior to me coming there. So I was like, oh, my God. So yeah, I told him I didn't want to talk to him anymore. And then he got pissed, and I guess that led to him spreading some crazy-ass rumors around about me. It was like so wild, too. Like the rumors were like illegal things, too. Yeah. Yeah, like the main one, like he made multiple, but like the main one that kind of like pissed me off the most. Like, sorry for my language, or, you know, you don't like me saying that, but like, whatever, whatever. It was saying like how I essayed a man, like, what? And he said, like, that's why, like, he kept on telling like almost every person in the school, like, hey, did you know that Ariella sexually assaulted a guy, and that's why she can't boys over? And like, he told one of my friends, and then like, she was like, how do you know? And then he said, she told me over text. And, um, yeah, and I'm like, what? I had never said anything relating to any of that, you know, text. And then he was like, you know, I stopped talking to her. I have screenshots of me saying I don't want to talk to him anymore. Like, bro. Yeah, that's crazy. It's like really weird. Like, yo, why is he so upset over something so petty? Like, take rejection, bro. Yeah. Hmm. What? Yeah, well, I mean, you're one thing that you're going to have to get used to, boys your age, not having the same maturity level as you. I guess. What's your thought? Um, I don't know. Basically what I just said. I mean, I wouldn't expect, I wouldn't expect other people, other boys to be as rational as you are. And, you know, to behave correctly, because guys just don't know how to act right until they're like 40 years old. Like you. Yeah, sure, dude, I'm not even 40 years old and I can't get it right. See what I'm saying? Huh? You see what I'm saying? I guess. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to talk to the counselor or principal on Monday about that, Brandon. Yeah. Because that's like, it's not just like being mean or like kind of starting a stupid rumor. That's like a criminal offense that he's trying to spread. That's like serious. And plus you've got boys bullying me. Like, it'd be different if it's like girls playing me, but having a whole different gender bullying me and trying to like hit me is different. Like, what? Yeah.

So, basically, I, last night, I drove, or whatever, this morning, I drove with, like, 120 miles, I got to work, I have, like, 60 miles left, so I'm not gonna make it home, really, unless I go and get gas after this, and I thought, since today's payday, usually I get paid by noon, and I haven't gotten paid, so I need you to send me, like, 20 bucks or something. So that I can get gas when I leave here. Okay. Please. Yeah, I really do need to wrap up at, like, 3.30 so I can go inside and grab some things and stop and get gas. Where are you coming from? Huh? Where are you working? Monticello. Yeah, so it's, like, an hour and 10 minutes, but I got here early, so I should have the whole, if I clock out at 3.50, then I worked six hours, exactly. Also, tomorrow, my mom wants to hang out the boys and you're supposed to come with me to Painesville tomorrow, right? Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, I guess we just, I don't know if we have to even get them ready. She said she'll be back at home at 8, like, tomorrow morning, I think. So she was, like, asking me all these fucking questions this morning when I was, like, waking up, and I was like, why? Like, why are you asking me all these questions? She's like, oh, I wanted to see if the boys could stay home tomorrow. She's like, I'll be there at 8, and I was like, okay, for what? And she was like, I don't know, just to hang out. And I was like, okay. So I guess she's watching them tomorrow. Okay. What? That's pretty convenient. It works out pretty well. Yeah, so I guess we don't really have to rush home, but, I mean, you're going to be with me. You're probably going to want to leave, like, once I get off work. Obviously, I'm not going to try to stay later, but, yeah, we don't have to rush home. To make it on time. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I'll. I can't really do that. I don't know. Yeah, all right. I was going to say, like, I can't. It might be a good idea for me to, like, go out to Benson and grab some stuff or something like that. But, like, it's not like you've got, like, really the best cargo vehicle. Right. I don't know what stuff. What stuff are you trying to grab? Oh, I have, like, a wheelbarrow and a fucking dolly. I don't know. There's some stuff. Yeah. No, I don't think we're going to fit either of those things in my car. That's what I just fucking said. I know. I just wanted to know what you were thinking. And I was like, oh, maybe we could, like, strap it on or something. Like, no, that's dumb. Don't bring your fucking wheelbarrow. Yeah. All right. Okay, well, I'll talk to you. Send me 20 bucks, please. No, I don't want to. You have to. I need to get home. No, I think it's about time for me to laugh at your expense. Oh, really? Yeah. I don't know why you're saying that. Like, that's not even my money. That's my money. It's just in your account. Huh? The money. When I send you money and then you got all these returns. Then I also got a paycheck. Yeah. Well, I never got the first half of the money that you had that you had. Just send me 20 bucks. Who are you talking to right now? Just fucking shut up. You shut up. I'm on speakerphone. You shut up and send me 20 bucks, please. I am. God. Okay. Okay, bye. Hold on. What? I wouldn't fucking just get off the phone with me. All right. Quick. Okay. Sorry. Anyone. Okay. It's okay. Okay. All right. I'll see you. All right. Bye.

What's up man? I'm just getting ready for bed. Oh yeah it is. I don't know if that's why I text you. I'm like well I don't know if he's up or not. Yeah no that's good I was kind of wondering the same thing about you. I was thinking I was going to come over tomorrow. Are you going to be around? Yeah. I'll probably be on my way out there kind of early because I only have like I don't know until basically like I don't know dark to do whatever. Okay so worst case scenario I gotta take you home. Well no I think Gabby will. I don't mind it if that's what needs to happen. I mean it's fun. Yeah I suppose we can cross that bridge when we get there but as for now yeah I know that I'll be able to get a ride out there tomorrow and have my stuff with me. We should have a game plan on what we're doing. Yeah yeah which is what I was thinking. Yeah it's good you're still awake. So what are you thinking? You gonna tackle that head gasket? Yeah I mean that'd be great but what did you figure out about your truck? I gotta pull the transmission out of there that I put in and then I gotta go switch it out with a different one and yeah I just need like I don't know. Do you feel like you should I mean do you feel like that you got a very limited window to return that I mean do you want me to come help you take that out? I mean I should be fine. I just I just just been kind of fucking irritated with the whole thing because I was under there for a while. Sure I know it's a lot of work. I mean now that I got it like I don't know all up in the air and and like already like put it took it apart and put it back together once like you know taking it back out again is relatively like easy. I know it's like I can like it annoys the fuck out of you doesn't it? Yeah. It's like like they it's like you feel like they betrayed you by giving you something that's garbage honestly. Yeah and now it's like now I don't know who I can trust like do I spend more money doing this or do I fucking go back and do what I originally planned on doing? No I hear you. My opinion would be to try to take that out and return it and tell them they got to make damn sure they give you one that's good. Right. They can't be giving you some shit that's broken. Right. In a way that's like taking the burden off of them trying to figure out if it's good or bad and throwing it on the customer. Yeah I mean and the guy did like anticipate that already too because he said he's like you know if it's not good you know just bring it back and I'll switch it out I mean he said that. Well yeah but it's easy for them to switch it out they're not the one putting it in and out of the car. I know dude that's why that's why I'm kind of pissed I'm like I should fucking make him pay me you know. Especially if you're paying a shop to do this shit oh my god. Right. Because they're damn sure not gonna take it out and switch it for you for free. I know well but Simon what do you want to and I think today's okay yeah so tomorrow's yeah so tomorrow's Wednesday so that means I can I can fuck with you all day long tomorrow but then the following day I gotta pull out that transmission because on Friday is when I'm going to bring it back and switch it out. Okay well it would be cool to like work on these cars right but also on the other hand I need to work on that tree over there at the Blaine house. Yeah I don't have a chainsaw. I got one. Yeah is it a nice one or is it fucking. Oh it's a piece of shit I'm talking about oh my god you gotta paint that motherfucker over about a billion times before it might think about running. That's terrible. But when it runs it runs. Matter of fact it runs so much you barely can turn it off. It just keeps running. Really? Like wide open all gas and no brakes. Oh really? Don't set it down. Something to do with the throttle or something? There ain't one. Oh that's crazy. It's all wired straight up. Wow did you do that yourself? No that's the way it came. It's missing covers. I got it for free. Oh. It's missing all you know. There's no oil in it either so if it gets hot you let it cool off. Wow. I mean in that case I'd probably buy one then. I know that sounds crazy as fuck doesn't it? No I got a good one. I got a good one. It's not a pile. Yeah. It's alright. I did buy quite a few of them until I actually got a good one. Yeah. I mean honestly if we were to do that tree thing tomorrow I wouldn't even I would suggest not even bringing a chainsaw anyways. I would suggest you know tying it off. You know I've got like I've got like a come along and. Oh bro I mean I'm gonna have to go rent a lift. Like we're gonna rent a lift and go and literally go and put a lift and cut the tree and make it safe and yeah. You should have taken a couple of pictures so I could see what you're talking about. Oh well I got one. So I can find it right quick. Man that means I need to get this trailer unloaded too. Shit. Well I guess I'll do it here in a minute. Because there's another. I need to have this trailer unloaded so I can haul that shit away. Yeah. Oh you got it? Oh I mean let me check. Oh no it says sending. So it's sending to you. You haven't received. So I was thinking if I rent a lift I could cut this big tree down. I can cut quite a few trees around here. You know what I mean? Yeah. With a lift you know because I'm renting it and I can just I can move it around a yard with a truck. Because they'll kind of tow behind the truck. Yeah. It's like $350. Okay. It's the cheapest one I could find. Yeah. But how high up do you need to go? I think I need to go 60 feet. Oh my god. Dude that's I wouldn't fucking want to go up that high. Oh I don't have a problem with it. Yeah but I don't mind it. Yeah. I mean you've seen that house that I lived in before. I had to. I'm fucking mad at that guy. That shit is dangerous. No doubt. It's very highly dangerous. Yeah dude that shit's like twice as 60 feet. That's like twice as high as that house. Well I don't know. 60 feet is the height of a tree line. If you look outside and look at the high trees that's 60 feet. Oh I think I just got it. No it's just offscending or something. Oh here we go. Yeah. Yeah dude. I would ratchet that thing. I'll do it. Well here's the thing. I climbed the tree and I put a rope in it already. I was going to cut the top out you know and then I was going to like I had a rope already rigged up and everything and someone was going to hold it on the ground. When I cut it it was all like you know what I mean. So you've been holding on to like that top piece basically. Yeah. Not like the whole thing but you know where the Y is at the top right corner. The whole piece there going up into the whole. So yeah. And then there would have been a secondary cut and then you know it's all undone. Right. But yeah but there's some other trees around that I want to cut too. So it's not the only one. That's not. There's some in the back that requires a lift because there's no way to get up get the tree and cut it unless you have a lift in the back because it's growing from the other people's property over hours and I want to cut the tops out. You know what I'm saying. It's growing over other people's property. It's growing. The trees are growing from the other people's property next door and it's growing over into our property and I want to cut the tops of the trees out. It's growing over big limbs growing over into the back because I planted a bunch of fruit trees behind this house. Yeah. So I already cut down quite a few trees around there but I want to knock this one down and there's a really big one in the front. I'm going to take that one. I need a lift to get up there and cut some limbs out of it. Yeah. So I'm saying so there's like a there's a need for it. I gotcha. But all this cutting requires a lot of cleaning up. So. Yeah definitely. It's a lot of cleaning up actually. And a matter of fact if you're going to help I actually have someone else lined up that can help too tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. Yeah. I mean. Yeah. Yeah. I got a guy that could come and help too. Hard ass worker. Well the problem is I can't really. I mean I don't mind giving you some money. I might give him like his other friend. I can't give everybody money. You know what I mean. Yeah. That's the problem. Right. Yeah. I wish I could. I mean. All right. Well you got to you got to figure out if you want to do this tree thing or if you want to do the head gasket thing because if if you do want to do the head gasket thing then I got to load up my tools tonight. I wish I could have talked to Linda more about this because I would because I'm going to use her car to rent the lift. Yeah. But. Yeah. What you said that you said on Thursday that you're going to work on a truck and you're going to go back and regroup and. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On Thursday I had to go. I had to make sure that the tranny is out of the truck. And like in the back of my. In the back of the car. So that on Friday morning I. We can leave early as fuck and. Go. Go on that journey to replace it. Yeah. It'll be a fun journey because I won't get out of three hours. No it's like. It's like an hour and a half two hour drive. No I'm talking about from getting it out. Oh. Um. Well. Probably probably not that long actually. I could probably get it back out in like. Maybe like an hour. Just because I've got all the tools. And I already know all the tools that I need. And have all the extensions and everything. Like already set up. Set aside. One fucking thing is. Is my my fucking little magnet light. My kids were in my bedroom. The other day. And like they fucking found it. My little magnet light. And then they like walked off with it. And I haven't been able to fucking find it since. Damn really? Yeah I fucking tore this house apart. Looking for it too. That's fucked up. Yeah. Because I'm. I definitely fucking need. I mean I got like one light. Or as convenient as that magnet one. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. You want to talk to Linda. Or maybe I should. Should I just plan to like load the tools up in the morning. Or. Um. I mean I got a lot of tools. I'm fairly confident. That I've got enough tools. To work on the car. You really think I don't? I would hate to be there. And like not have something. It would be nice if we could get this done in one day. That would be great. Yeah. You haven't started it? I haven't started it. It's still in running driving condition. Okay. And I got some really big ramps. To put it on. Car ramp jacks or whatever. I got some extra large ones. That's good. I got a big jack now. Yeah. That's good. I'm jealous. It's definitely super luxurious. To have it like. It's just like jack. Yeah. This is like the necessities. To even work on a car. You know what I mean. I was there with a fucking scissor jack for the longest. Yeah. I got a hydraulic jack. But they're both like two ton jacks. Which is like not the biggest. It's like. Yeah. Technically I shouldn't be using it to lift up the truck. Like I mean I can. But like only like a quarter of the vehicle. Basically. Yeah. I mean that's what they say anyways. I fucking picked up the front end of it. The other day. It was just really hard. Hey. He goes ahead and uses it anyways. Yeah. I'm just like super cautious. Because I fucking. I like. I had like my truck up on jack stands. And all jacked up once. And I was in my buddy's like yard. And fucking that was like. And that thing ended up like falling down. Not on me. But like I was like a couple feet away. And I had just recently been under there. Damn. And then the thing fell down. How did it fall down? Because I wasn't on like concrete. I was on gravel. Oh. Sure. You didn't have the solid underneath it. Yeah. So like now seeing that. And kind of having that little bit of phobia. Like I'll never let that shit happen again. I'll never fucking. Like when I put it up. I'll like. You know you do the test. And if I can fucking like check that thing. And like rock that thing at all. With my body. Then like. I don't know. That's just you got to give it a test. Because I know that if I can fucking like. Put all my weight into it. And like basically go to the trailer hitch. Or something like that. And like fucking basically try to tip it over. And if I can't make it tip over. Then it passes the test. I can tell you those big jack stands I got. You ain't finna fit anything to move. So. It ain't moving. Once you set it on there. It ain't moving. That's good. Like pretty large. That's good. I mean they're for a truck. Yeah. I don't know. I mean I got them from Harbor Freight. So they have different ones. And I just got the large one that I got. Oh the six ton one. Probably. Yeah. I was just on Harbor Freight last night. Looking at stuff. You know I was expecting to see all the prices. Of everything on every shelf everywhere. Go like sky high. But I haven't seen that happen yet. Yeah. Well. Well think about it. Everything is from everywhere. Okay. Yeah. And if that's the case. Then that means there's a tariff associated. With that product to be brought here. Yeah that's why some things. Some things are like. Yeah. Because the tariffs and all that. Right. And people have been getting bills. That are tariff bills in the mail. From ordering shit. Did you know that? Yeah. Yeah I know that the vapes. That I usually smoke. They're apparently from fucking China. Which I didn't know. And so for a while. We couldn't get the vapes. To use. Because the fucking company. Went out of business. Damn. And you had to like change up. Yeah. Well actually. Yeah I did change it. The brand or whatever. But like. I think that's what the company did. I think they fucking just changed their. Their logos and all that shit. And then they kept on doing production. They're actually the same ones. But. Don't you just love. The planet. How it all operates. Yeah I know. Not even the country. It's the planet. Everybody operates like that. File bankruptcy. Start a new business. New business name right away. Yeah. So. Alright. I'm. Damn it makes me think. We should be working on cars tomorrow then. I guess. I don't know. At least we know what we're doing. You know what I mean. I did tell that other person. I'm going to be having him help me tomorrow though. But that doesn't guarantee me. He's going to be ready to go. I'll have to go pick him up too. Alright. Yeah he don't have a car. Oh I see. He's in St. Paul. Yeah. But that shit doesn't need to happen though. Over there. But it can happen next week too. If you have any availability. I mean. I can make some time. You'd probably be better off next week. Coming over because you'd have your truck. In theory. Why are you saying theory? I don't know. Like I was saying. I don't fucking trust. I don't trust where I'm getting it from. I don't trust that it's the next one. I'm going to get is going to be good. I mean. It's like this. They gave you one. I don't know if it's good or bad. So I'm giving one to you. You come back with it's bad or good. Then they go okay. We'll give you a good one this time. We know it's good. Yeah. That's really the best way. To find out if one's good or bad. Is to put it in the vehicle and find out. I mean you can bench. You can do a couple different things. To bench test it. Right I get that. You don't set shit up like that. To make it see if it's working. Right yeah. I mean you can do like certain things. But it requires disassembling a little bit. I mean the easiest thing to do. Is like to take that. That down shaft. And like switch it from. And switch the. The gear from like park. Because when it's in park. It should be like totally locked up where you can't. It won't spin left or right. And then like. In every gear besides park. Like it should spin freely. In one direction. And then like be kind of sluggish in the other. And then like. If you take the valve body off. You can like. Do like an air check. Air test. Like with an air hose. Where you're like. You're like spraying air. Into like the different little ventricles. Like the air goes through it for a second. And then like the little marble. Catches. And it's like. You hear like a big pop. And it needs to do that. For every little ventricle. That you test. And there's like I think like six of them. Yeah I don't know. It also really fucking helps. That I got like that digital manual for it now. The truck anyways. Which I'd recommend. Getting the digital manual. For this thing with the head gasket too. Oh how much is that? It's 30 bucks. For the year. Oh do you get to look at any car? No. You have to pay for it by. So here's the thing. So like I found two different resources. Like one is like a pirated resource. Where like some like. Some I don't know. Just got together and they like compiled. All of like the data. That I'm paying for. Into like one website. And. Is that like all that or something like that? Yeah it's called Operation Charm. I've never heard of that. Yeah. Yeah it says like right on the. Right on the fucking home screen. Of their website like. If you have like a. A subscription to Mitchell One. Or any of that. Mitchell One yeah that's a good one. Yeah he's like if you have an active. Subscription to that. Let us know and we'll compensate you. If you like share your login information. With us. Wow are you kidding me? Yeah that's what it says on there. I mean I don't understand. Why would you share it with them? That doesn't make sense. Because they scrape the websites. Okay. I'll send. This fucking thing to you. I'm sure they get a lot of people that's willing to do it. I mean. I've tried to do it. Myself. I've tried to scrape those websites but it's. I don't know it's difficult. Scraping it can be difficult. Yeah I can imagine. Okay so. That'd be like creating an aggregator. And sharing. An algorithm. This is the website I just sent it to you. Yeah so this is the. This website I just sent you. That's the one that has like all the different. Like. Yeah all the dealership stuff. You can find on there for whatever car. It has almost every car. But there's this. And this is free. But. It's a little bit more difficult to navigate. Than. I don't know the one that I pay for. Is nice. Because I can like. I don't know it's a lot easier to find what I'm looking for. I mean I'm saying for instance. Are you able to look my car up with it or not? Yeah. Oh okay. Yeah like. Let's see. I imagine it's very helpful. It gives you like a step by step. Direction breakdown. Yeah. So this is a. Ford what? It's a 2017. Ford Escape. Gabby's. Girlfriend. Doesn't go up that high. It goes up to 2013. That sucks. Yeah. You can see. Oh yeah. Ford Escape. Four wheel drive? Front wheel drive. Okay. Is it 4.2 in it? Or is it 6.3? 1.5. Okay. 1.5 4 cylinder. Okay. Alright. 2.0. That's the closest thing. And it's a 2013 is what. The closest thing on here. For sure. But. Are you looking at it too? No I actually didn't. But I will. I was just letting you look at it first. Gasket. Okay. Well. But. It doesn't really have it. Which sucks. I mean. It's probably got like a similar. It's so close. 13. Four years off. There's got to be another. There's got to be something else. I mean surely there's. I mean. I don't get it. This is the free version. Okay then maybe that's why. Yeah. Yeah the paid version would be. Yeah. Certainly definitely way. Way more helpful. Yeah that's exactly why. Well we can print something off offline. Of how to do it. We can print videos. Like step by step videos on YouTube too. Yeah. I don't have a torque wrench. Yeah I got one. Okay. I think yeah. I think we have everything. Okay. I believe we. I believe we should. We should have knocked this out in one day. Honestly. I got all the. Specialty tools and everything. Yeah. To you know. To put it back in time. Yeah. He said 2017. Ford Escape. Yeah I wonder how much it costs to go buy a book. Damn. Man fuck that book. Yeah but then I get to keep it. I'm sorry. Yeah. Oh I got a PDF now. Oh that's cool. Wow there's a free version. On you. Y-U-M-P-U. That's actually pretty cool. I wonder if there's shit on here. Yeah. Maybe. Oh. Oh. Well you know what. They don't go on. Well it says from. Escape 01 to 17. Yeah. I don't know if this is helpful or not. It says I can download a PDF. Yeah it should. He said it was a. 4 cylinder. And it was a 1.8. 1.5. 1.5. Yes. So here's the crazy thing. Is this particular car. They only made this car. For 3 years. And made it 2017. Through 2019. And all of them. Have a defective block. You hear that. Yeah. Yeah. And it blows up the head gaskets. On cylinder 2. And cylinder 2 and 3. In between 2 and 3. Because the walls. Between the cylinders. From one cylinder to the next. Is so thin. There's not a lot of room there. Holy shit. Huh. It says that the labor hours. For replacing the head gasket. 14 to 15 hours. 14 to 15 hours. Yeah. Why do I find that hard to believe. But maybe. I don't know. You think it's going to take that long. Well yeah. I knew right away. It was going to take at least 8 or 9 hours. Yeah. I think it's going to take a little while. All day I'm sure. Yeah. It is what it is. Unless you don't want to do it. Isn't this the one that you. Got a new engine out for. No. That was a different one. Uh huh. And that engine right there. It's not going to be that easy to put in either. It's going to be a pain in the ass. So yeah. That was going to be a pain in the ass for sure. Because it was a total pain in the ass to get it out. Yeah. You had to use their cherry picker. I did but. It's just the amount of shit that I had to take off. It's not like I could just unhook the motor. And just hang on it as it was. I had to unhook everything. That means everything from this car. Is going to be put. Back on their new engine. Right. All kind of shit. Sensors. Brackets. Fucking alternators. Holy shit. A lot. This fucking pump. That's on the left side of the engine. Power steering pump. That's another one. Yeah. That's going to be a pain in the ass. Probably a two day job right there. Yeah. Yeah. But it should run good after it's in there. Yeah. As long as you don't fuck anything up. Like taking it out. Or putting it back in. Yeah. Which in some cases is easy to do. I know. Taking that I didn't care if I broke anything. Right. I didn't break anything on the motor or anything. But yeah. I cut some shit on my car. That's for sure. Yeah. Wiring harness. Whatever. I'm not going to do that on this car here. Because you don't have to use this yet. So that means you have to be really careful and take longer time. But I was also thinking that just dropping the whole engine and transmission together. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe if there's enough room to take it out of the hood. Maybe not. Might be easier to do that. Just pull it straight up and out. If you don't want to take the bottom apart. You know what I mean. Just take the motor out the top and put it back in there. That's the way to go. Because that's a lot of shit you don't have to take apart. You know. Just focus on the bolts around the fucking engine. Focus on the torque converter bolts. Starter. All the wiring harness all around it. All that shit. Exhaust pieces. Yeah I'm looking at the instructions right now. I'm talking about the cross for the engine. That's the view for the cross motor we're talking about. Now the Ford Escape. That's just the top end. But you know like you're saying. It's going to take some time. To take the side of the motor apart and shit. Okay. I got to get going. Gabby's trying to come in here and go to bed. Alright. What time are you trying to get dropped off? I think somewhere between. Somewhere between 7 and 9. Alright. Well in that very time frame. I take my son to daycare. Okay. So. Just call me when you're on the way. So I can see where you're at and where I'm at. I have to drop him off at the plane. But if you get here early enough. You can just ride with me to drop him off at the plane. Alright. I'm pretty sure that we drop off our kids. I know that. I know that we drop off our kids. In between like 8 and 8.30? Yeah. I try to get him there about 8. Same time. 8 o'clock. Yeah. That way they start breakfast at 8.30. I try to get him there right before breakfast. That way he can be having breakfast there. When he goes. Alright man. I'll let you go. I'll see you tomorrow. Alright. Bye bye. Bye.","strategic_notes":"{\"title\":\"Maintenance and Property Project Coordination\",\"summary\":\"The conversation involves two individuals planning mechanical repairs and property maintenance for the upcoming days.

I just seen your little video. Did you figure it out? Huh? I figured. No, no, no, no. We're each so looking where... Yeah, you just... What was that? You just need to start one. Need to start one? No, like you asked me on your phone. He's like, which one do I click so that I don't read? Like I just... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where a gentleman had told me that they just go to turn off and then turn it back on. And that's what I did. Where it works, where I didn't... I don't even know what the fuck that is besides like a fucking... I've never seen that screen before. Yeah. Have you been pushing buttons like on your phone like... No. I tell you... No, I went to go plug it in and charge it. And the next thing I know, looking at it, that's what... That was not my fucking thing where the phone was being on yet. I don't even know how I did it. Where I'm guessing like fucking the power and up or down or all of them are being pushed or something. I don't even know how the fuck it happened. Yeah, that's usually how it happens. Okay. Where did you get your truck fixed? No, I mean, I don't know. Like I can't fucking get it to turn on. Like I'm trying to like bypass the fucking interlock thing right now. Oh, shit. That might actually be something you have to bring in for them. Like you do that kind of stuff at all? I don't know. Well, the shitty thing is like if I pay them for a code like I normally would, then... And if it's not fixed, then I basically just paid them for no reason. Absolutely. Okay. Does that inhibit your fucking shit from even like starting? If you were to blow over, would your vehicle still start? If you were to blow and you had alcohol in your system? No, it wouldn't. It would say like a violation or something like that or fail. And it wouldn't. Okay. Where it doesn't even fucking turn on or engage? No. No. Well, right now it's in a lockout because like if you like have it towed... Like because there's a tracker in it too. And if it like figures out that it's like moving without being turned on, then they assume that it's being tampered with. So they fucking trigger a lockout. Now, can you call and inquire if they lock you out? It's just automatic. Like if you cut the power to the battery and like the device like doesn't have power, then it locks out. And you like move the vehicle without it being on, then it locks out. Okay. Then how do you get it going then after fucking with it? What do you mean? Well, I mean, if I wanted to pay that money... For when we towed it? If it was a lockout, it would take five days for it to happen. Okay. Well, it's bad for a week where... Yeah, I knew that it once... I knew that once after those five days, I wasn't going to be able to start it unless I had a code. Okay. But you don't know if that's what it is inhibiting it or not? I don't know. Yeah, I can't really tell because... Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Because basically, I tried jumping the starter and it's not like it's not working. So I don't know if I like fried my starter or what the deal is. I don't know. So I was just looking up how to tell just in case I'm like missing something. Okay. Are you back at home then? Yeah. What would the chance that Gabby will let you use your vehicle or ease up to a hundred bucks right now still trying to find a ride? I mean, I'm somewhat down, but I also am supposed to go grab for Dan. Right. Where I know listening to Doug last night, his cousin just keeps getting higher and higher and I don't know. He's getting fucking livid. Yeah. Yeah, but I can't really do anything less than a pound though. Right. Isn't that what he was looking for? I don't think so. Okay. But I don't know. You could ask him. No, I mean, Dan. Well, yeah. We're in that doing that. You probably ask him if you could fucking get whatever off of that, like for however you want to work it. So then start offering something to Doug where I know that he's starting to fucking look elsewhere. But I don't know what he has for options because with it being his cousin, it's fucking, I think that's been his primary goal too. Or when he doesn't have it, his cousin will take him to somebody else where at times that he gets here, that just holds up even more. Because then his cousin wants something out of it too.

And maybe if I could just meet with you every once every couple of months or something like that or I don't know, whatever is clever, really. Well, I think I'm not going to lie. The weekdays are probably going to be the best. Even when I'm here at work, even on my lunch break or something like that. I think that might be a little bit more possible. Yeah. Yeah. You know. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. Yeah. There's one to like communicate that, you know. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of about. Just your performance and CPRs. And, you know, like, you know, your name came up in one of our meetings. That has to just do with under 20 hours, you know. I think like two weeks ago, you got me pretty decent hours, like 25 hours or something like that. But last weekend, you know, pretty much the rest of the month, it's all been 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours or something like that, you know. So what was the like what changed during that week? I believe was the week from the 5th of October to the 11th. You had about 25 hours. Was there anything different? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've spoke like between me and my partner and we kind of sat down and had like one of those fiscally responsible conversations where we're like, OK, well, how much money are you taking in? OK, well, how much money could I be taking in? My partner, you know, my my spouse, my baby mama. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, we determined that it would be better for me to to work, you know, more full time. You know, that way she would be the one dropping the kids off at daycare and picking up the kids from school. And and and also she's got a practicum that she's got to start preparing for at the end of this month. So she's going to be not working at all at the end of this month. And then so basically we decided that, you know, she was going to be that person so that I could, you know, do my best to start, you know, at like 8 a.m. and go, you know, basically have two appointments a day rather than just like that one and then having to do appointments in between. You know, it's it's. Yeah. But that's what made it better is, you know, we're kind of diving right into that. And then what changed in the last couple of weeks? I don't know. I think I think we just need to kind of reinforce our action on that, because I right now, I think with my my truck having had some issues, I naturally should just be at work if I'm not working. But now that I got I got to get my windshield replaced and I should be back at it. OK. But is that like stopping you from meeting? It hasn't. No, even even while my even while my truck has had work done, I've still been able to, you know, use my other car. Yeah, I want you to think about it, though, because that's kind of like what I'm thinking about is, you know, so the beginning of October, the first week, you have 12 hours of like services you provided. And then the week after that was like 25 hours and then the week after that was 11 hours and then last week was nine hours. So the week of the 25th, what was different from the past those other weeks? And why do you believe it is like relatively low? I think it's just you can really think about it like factors. Yeah, I don't I don't know, I guess I guess the only reason I would have is that it's low is just because I haven't been taking two appointments throughout the day. Like I anticipated, I was going to, which I think it is in my I know it's in my range to be able to do it. And especially with my clients. Do you feel like there's not a lot of motivation? No, no, no, no, definitely not. Definitely not that. So and so you're saying it's just not getting to the appointments? No, no, I guess I guess the short, simple answer, the reason why is just because my obligations at home kind of called me back. You know, I couldn't or like I would start late. Hold on a simple answer. Yeah, my obligations at home called me home sooner than I would have liked. Or I had to start later than I would have liked. Okay. Yeah, I mean, it is definitely concerning, you know, because I believe you do have the capacity to, you know, go out there and meet with clients and I mean it's not even part time what you're doing. It's almost as if like it's very low, you know. Furthermore, like I remember just when we brought you on and I wanted to start you at 21. And you said like, hey, that's pretty low. Would you be able to bump it up and I don't know if you remember this conversation that I had with you, where I was pretty much saying like hey okay well you know because you're in more. You said, you know, you know, I could go to Minneapolis, the Twin Cities or I could go to St. Cloud and I said, you know, I think if you go to St. Cloud, there's definitely a lot of clients there. Heidi's out there, and other CPRS's and if you were to go up there and work there and sort of like be consistent in that, then I could get you to 23, which we did automatically like it wasn't like a trial run like I just made, you know, we wrote you the offer letter right away. And, you know, honestly, I do understand like obligations at home and things like that. But I also don't think you're holding up like your end of the deal. Okay. Does that sound fair to you or irrational. I guess. I don't know. I guess I don't, I don't see the amount of hours, it is, I guess I see the amount of work that I put on out there. So I guess I'd have to say my experience so far has been really positive. I understand that the 20 hour. Is it 21 hour or 20 hours. 20. 20. Yeah, I understand that the 20 hour contract is kind of binds me to perform a certain way. And, and I see that I fallen short of that, no doubt. I think I even got a write up for it. Probably about four weeks ago. Yeah. Yeah, so I'd have to agree with you there. Yeah, so I mean, does that concern you, because is that something that. Yeah, I mean it concerns me. It concerns me a little bit. Yeah, I mean, not just a little bit. Yeah, because I don't want to, I don't want to lose this position. No, and I don't want you to, I don't want you to either. Right. But I do think it's like, it's, you know, at the end of the day is a job. Right. And, you know, the people that you're working with the clients that like need no services that are being assigned to you. I don't think there is a shortage of people who need peer recovery services. I think the resources are there. So that really leads me to ask kind of like how are things with you is everything okay. You mentioned kind of stuff going on at home. What do you see as a possible solution to get you to become, you know, average part time staff if not full time, so that you could, you know, do the work that you enjoy doing. I think I just need to get my truck back. There's a special answer I guess, but how long have you had your truck. How long have I not had my truck you mean. Yeah. So it went out. It was on Wednesday. Not last week, but the week before. So it's been about a week and a half now. I had to do the transmission and get three of my windows replaced some glass. Yeah. Right. I mean the truck. If it was a week and a half ago I mean you've had, you know, consistently under 20 hours for quite some time. And it's the only reason that I'm having this conversation really. It was like a one off thing or something like that. You know my job is to really just understand exactly what it is that's going on, and try to see if there's anything that I can do to help. You know, in the least just at least trying to see if we can figure it out together you know. Yeah, I mean I think another thing, and we've run, we got this goal of moving down closer to the cities, because the hour long commute is kind of, kind of a drag, but at the same time, I had the opportunity of working, like, just once or twice kind of close to my area out here. Yeah, I guess I shouldn't, like, totally. Yeah, but I guess, I don't know, aside from like what Huda explained to me the other day, she said that recovering hope here in town is short a CPRS. So that would mean I might be working out of there a little bit more with their clientele, which would mean I wouldn't have the commute on those days. And I'm totally open to that. Yeah. I guess I just need to follow up with her to see if she has had any updates on that I guess. Okay. Yeah, I mean, opportunities like that here come here and there, you know, but I do understand the location does make it difficult. You know, if you are able to go to St. Cloud or here in the Twin Cities, there's definitely opportunities. You know, I don't think that happens in a day, you know, could definitely take some time. Like, especially like with the relocation and whatnot, but, you know, eventually though, you know, you have to get to 20 hours a week, you know, and we will try to do what we can to provide you with resources and clients and, you know, we're trying to always like increase our partnerships with people. Partnerships with different organizations and stuff. So, but if that's not able to happen in the meantime, you know, I do think commuting to St. Cloud was going to be your best bet. Yeah, to commute, but also, you know, there is work there. There's a lot of clients there that need services. Initially, that's kind of, you know, the promise that you made. Right. Right, right, right. I understand. So, I mean, I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to work with you here, you know, but we got to stick to our policies. Okay. I totally understand. Okay. Yeah, I'm on board. Yeah. Okay. Okay, good. Yeah. Yeah, let me know. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. I totally understand what you're saying, and I totally take this phone call for what it is, and you're just reaching out because you don't want to see me go and you want to see me successful. I totally appreciate that. And, yeah, I guess the only thing I could really ask for right now is just some patience, because I know that I'm going to improve my hours so that, you know, my goal is to have 40 plus hours. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, you know, I don't know that though, right, like I, I believe you, but also, like at the end of the day it's, you know, I'm going off of, you know, this conversation that we had when we first brought you on, you know, and the fact that that didn't pan out and it really just kind of went how it went. You know, I am a little just a little bit disappointed. Because that's like the reason that we start people off at $18 an hour, sometimes 19, depending on your experience I thought $21 was a good amount. And I wanted to give you that opportunity. And the reason why we do that is because a lot of people, you know, they want to join the team, and then when they do, the effort is really bare minimum. And it's enough to get by. But it's like, you know, that's, I mean, and to most people's, you know, defense like this, it can be a challenging job. I get that. You know, but why commit to something. If you're not willing to take on that challenge and endure that. Does that make sense. Yeah. I can tell you're really disappointed about the St. Cloud thing. Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, that was a, that was a, just a contingency of making, you know, giving you that $2 increase. Sure don't do for everybody, you know, but he had a really great interview. And I want to, I love giving people those opportunities, you know, but the whole time I just kind of been watching on the side. And, you know, looking at the hours and I'm not saying that you're like a terrible CPR or anything, that's definitely not what I'm saying. But also, it does kind of look like, you know, the bare minimum. You know, and does that have to do with the fact that you live in more probably right and the challenge that could come with that, but that's why I figured you know if you're able to travel and make that commute. Then it would be helpful, which is something that you agreed to ultimately, you know. So, I mean, does that sound rational to you though. That I'm able to do that. No, just like my concern, like the reason I have this concern. That sounds fair. Yeah, yeah I mean I just looking at my, at my time sheet. Yeah, I would definitely be making the same call that you're, you are right now. Yeah. So I just want to ultimately just figure this out. And, you know, if you're saying that like once you get your truck back and things are able to change and then yeah, but I would like you to uphold that that commitment of making that commute to same file. If it's too much of the capacities there. Okay. Okay. I mean I do have a couple of clients out there and, and I see that there's opportunity every time I just when I was out there the other day, I was able to kind of meet new people. And even some people that are were a part of my recovery out here, and more. Yeah, there's, there's definitely opportunity. Okay, so what. I mean, how do you how do you want to go about this moving forward, so that we're on the same page. Um, so I guess I mean we're going to, we can communicate that my, my goal is the 40 hours, and, you know, obviously, let's start with 20. Okay, let's just start with 20 right 20 if you get to 40 hours that's great that's more clients that you're serving, building those relationships with, but we just asked them 20, which is really like on the low end of part time, you know the high end would be 30, which is 30 is still part time, you know. So, if you can get to 20. Okay. Well, I think that I can well I know that I can do that. Okay. And I've got to call back my, I had to call back my partner now so I can have that discussion with her as well to kind of reinforce what our, our plan was. Okay. Okay. Do you have a second job. No. Okay. And then your supervisor is my mouse. And then also just, you know, communicate with him about like how you could the best way like increase your hours or, you know, build on your caseload. And I'm pretty sure he can assist with that as well. Yeah, absolutely. So, I'll be watching man and, you know, we'll, we'll reconvene about this. Okay. So I appreciate you know the work that you're doing, you know, I want to have you on the team, but also do want to see improvement as well. Being a CPRS. Absolutely, absolutely. Well, I'm motivated to do that call. Yeah. Yeah, you can always give me a call to if there's any issue or something that you want to know or anything like that. Okay. All right, well I appreciate you giving me a call. It's good to hear from you. Yeah, absolutely. You got a busy week. Ah, let's see, let's see. Well yeah we'll get the March conference this week. I'll be attending. What's that busy. The March conference is. What does it stand for it's like the Minnesota addiction and recovery conference. It's like a huge conference with pretty much all the addiction and recovery providers in the state of Minnesota so like many different treatment centers nonprofits government agencies. And there's like just conferences and people talking and things that change legislation, all that stuff so it's pretty big conference. And that's in Forest Lake you said. No, I think last year they had it in St. Paul. I don't know where they're having it this year, I have to check, but, but we got, we have, I got a ticket so I'm going to be going up there tomorrow. Yeah, definitely look it up check it out. Yeah, please to connect. It's called the March conference. Yep. A. I think there's two Rs. Ch. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna look that up that sounds interesting. So, expensive, expensive ass tickets or what. Say that again, super expensive tickets or what. I think they're like maybe 70 bucks. Okay. Okay. All right, well I'll look into that. But I'll talk to you soon though. Maybe sometime this week. All right. Yeah, give me a call man. All right, I'll see you. Yep. Thank you.

How are you doing? Hey, Brandon, how are you doing? I'm doing all right, man. What's going on? Not too much. Just kind of had a couple of different appointments today and some running around. How are you doing? I'm doing good, man. I'm doing good. I just kind of want to talk to you about something that's kind of been on my mind. Just with the whole mentorship stuff. Yeah. Because I know, you know, we kind of scheduled that stuff and it's just kind of been a little bit difficult. And I don't think Sunday's a really good time because I still get those confirmations. And, you know, I think it's going to definitely be challenging. And, you know, I don't want to, you know, I really don't want to make that like an issue. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I totally understand. And that's kind of the thing. I know that you've got a lot of responsibility. And yeah, I don't I don't I definitely don't want you to feel obligated to that as well. But I got to say, I'm super thankful for that for meeting with you. And maybe if I could just meet with you every once every couple of months or something like that or I don't know, whatever is clever, really. Well, I think I'm not going to lie. The weekdays are probably going to be the best. Even when I'm here at work, even on my lunch break or something like that. I think that might be a little bit more possible. Yeah. Yeah. You know. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. Yeah. There's one to like communicate that, you know. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of about. Just your performance and CPRs. And, you know, like, you know, your name came up in one of our meetings. That has to just do with under 20 hours, you know. I think like two weeks ago, you got me pretty decent hours, like 25 hours or something like that. But last weekend, you know, pretty much the rest of the month, it's all been 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours or something like that, you know. So what was the like what changed during that week? I believe was the week from the 5th of October to the 11th. You had about 25 hours. Was there anything different? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've spoke like between me and my partner and we kind of sat down and had like one of those fiscally responsible conversations where we're like, OK, well, how much money are you taking in? OK, well, how much money could I be taking in? My partner, you know, my my spouse, my baby mama. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, we determined that it would be better for me to to work, you know, more full time. You know, that way she would be the one dropping the kids off at daycare and picking up the kids from school. And and and also she's got a practicum that she's got to start preparing for at the end of this month. So she's going to be not working at all at the end of this month. And then so basically we decided that, you know, she was going to be that person so that I could, you know, do my best to start, you know, at like 8 a.m. and go, you know, basically have two appointments a day rather than just like that one and then having to do appointments in between. You know, it's it's. Yeah. But that's what made it better is, you know, we're kind of diving right into that. And then what changed in the last couple of weeks? I don't know. I think I think we just need to kind of reinforce our action on that, because I right now, I think with my my truck having had some issues, I naturally should just be at work if I'm not working. But now that I got I got to get my windshield replaced and I should be back at it. OK. But is that like stopping you from meeting? It hasn't. No, even even while my even while my truck has had work done, I've still been able to, you know, use my other car. Yeah, I want you to think about it, though, because that's kind of like what I'm thinking about is, you know, so the beginning of October, the first week, you have 12 hours of like services you provided. And then the week after that was like 25 hours and then the week after that was 11 hours and then last week was nine hours. So the week of the 25th, what was different from the past those other weeks? And why do you believe it is like relatively low? I think it's just you can really think about it like factors.

I understand that, but I meant like is your body not dirty? Like do you need to shower No, I'm not dirty. Okay, cool. All right. Well, yeah, I mean I threw your black jacket like that one zip jacket in the dryer like with my white wash and dryer with my clothes and then I folded the clothes at you. Oh my God. Maria is going to get engaged today. She's going to get what? Engaged. Oh really? Because it's going to happen dot dot dot. I'm so nervous and he invited my family because she knew that it was like coming up. Why am I uncomfortable with that idea? My family is not the thing. She's funny. But yeah, she's I guess getting engaged today. This is my moment, not theirs. I suppose maybe he thought you want them there. Wanted it more private. Okay. But yeah, so when you get here, yeah, you can change. Like I said, hopefully the boys will be all ready and you need an oil change. I need an oil change. Yes.

And as soon as she got hung up on the whole weed thing, where this is what we agreed upon, where I was going to be able to grab my board and stuff. And then she got to the point of, no, mom, I'm just doing it as you raised me. Do as you say. Say as you do. Follow through with what you say. That's what I'm trying to do. Where if you're good on the book, sweet. Well, how do I know that you're not going to pay me? Because I'm not you, mom. When is that ever the case? And I kind of threw in her face where there's going to be some marijuana issues come in. But she did ask for you specifically to be the one to be here to grab my stuff or whatever. I was going to have Doug come with me to do it. I figured that would be okay. I talked to her to see if I can get my fucking lawn mower and some change of clothes because I've been wearing the same clothes since the day I got out of the fucking hospital of when she broke the fucking bolt on my fucking face through a reconstructive surgery. She pissed me off so fucking bad. I'm just fucking living. I called her out on some shit. I let her know that her company that hires a PCA and ILS worker has turned down now two of the three people that I sent her to be her worker where Cassie has already passed the PCA certification. Brie had her PCA certification where she just had to redo it. Where they are already, so why are they not hiring her? It might have something to do with, hey, I know it's not your job, but can you hand me this? As the worker did to then watch you call me in on violation of a no contact order where I was looking to go and you took the one thing that I was looking for to go to call me in on. If she talks to her about this and I can see why they're not hiring anybody to give her her worker. I don't know if it's because I smoke. No, mom, marijuana is legal. That's not it at all. Where you put a fucking worker in the middle of some bullshit drama where she did not speak highly of you and probably shared what happened with the fucking company. Mom, how can you be so fucking stupid to not think that when they're referring to, oh, we'll guarantee that we'll get your son into a place that they never run out of room in prison ever. They'll make room for you. And she's like, you don't even know what to talk about. Mom, I know where I left my e-cig. I went in the kitchen three fucking times where when you got there with your worker, I was just finishing up dishes that you were going to have her rewash. That makes no fucking sense. Where what you did is you got your worker into where my e-cig was. You didn't want to fucking come in there to grab and me see you take my fucking e-cig. So secretly and try to hurtfully fucking get her to hand it to you. Where, no mom, where I'm so fucking pissed. Where the court fucked up saying that they were thinking that it's my mom was my, was Seth. The fucking, the no contact order. But they do have MS on the paperwork. But in court, if you were to read the transcripts and everything, they were talking about Seth and them thinking that that's who the fucking order was from. And that that's what was around. And I told my attorney this. I'm like, they're confusing the mother of my children with my mother on this no contact order. Where they have my mom's initials. That this is the one that's about. This is what the, where my mom's exact words were. He's losing his mind. He needs to get a competency assessment because you've lost your mind over these rocks. Where, no mom, I'm not a fucking idiot. I didn't throw my life away fucking chasing crack. And my children neglected fucking eating shitty ass fucking rotten food for God knows where. I learned something that she knows that. Although her dumb ass can't see it. It's going to be. It's going to change how our history is even understood. Where I just got done speaking to somebody at WC. Where she busted out some geoids and all that stuff. Where now if you were to take those images that I see in these rocks. And compare them to Mesoamerican pictoglyphs. And compare them to the Sumerian hieroglyphs. And the teophonic set. You really quickly begin to see the similarities to what it is that I'm talking about. Although it's not familiar to us. As much as it is for me for being a fucking historian fucking geek. Where again if we have a hundred different fucking fonts and textiles when it comes to the letter A. How many of these A's do you got to see over and over again to say hey. I think this is something where it may not be the exact same. There is a different accent or. Feature or font or textile or fucking whatever. But they all kind of have that same A appearance. Now I understand as time goes on. With it all being stone. That there is no real separation. But when you put AI or like an artist in there to paint the image. To give it color and to separate like part of what the pictoglyph is. For the rest of the pictoglyphs or hieroglyphs or whatever the fuck you want to call it. That I wouldn't have had the priest from fucking St. Olaf. Acknowledge the fact that we have a pyramid in the thinks here in the metro. See what I wouldn't be getting the fucking. The more I talk to people about it. I'm honing in on how to address it. Point things out. Let them. Vary or weigh into what it is that they think that they see. Where I've now had five six times of my. AI or my phone trying to address me to. Get in contact with Graham Hancock. Because he's one of the people in Gaia about how. We are a species of amnesia where we don't know a shit about a past. Where the rocks that this lady has here. We're talking about. We can go back to about a million years. Where homo erectus homo co-madness. At least six chromosomes backwards. Where we were. Whatever you like. Fucking. 46. Right now. 23 me. So we're at 46. So to go back. Six chromosomes. Where. We are. Fucking. Cave. The line. Very fast. Watch. Fucking. Head thumpers. Flat skull. That. Why don't we have any evidence. Of what it is. Where there is. That. That's. Probably true and relevant. But there is so much of our history. That is. Non-disclosed. Non-talkable. Where. We got. A fucking. Asteroid. That is slowing down. Changing directions. Where. What was supposed to be splitting. Between. Us and the moon. Is now. Just going to be coasting around. The backside of the sun. Where. It leaves a lot of potential. Of what the fuck. Where I really think. If what it is. What it is. I. I'm not even joking. Where I. Had a dream of you and I. Sitting underneath a bridge. In some weird. Fucking. Gear. Where. We were in a conflict zone. And we were. Downtown Minneapolis. Underneath a bridge. And shit. Where. It's fucking weird. But. I could see. This fucking ship. Coming through. To actually be a ship. Because since the news. And it says. Where. This is not just. What you think it is. Where you don't know. What it is. But it's fucking weird. That. I could see. If our ship. Our planet. Supposed to go into. A cataclysmic state. Like it does. Every 36,000 years. How do we know. It's not. Our fucking. Ancient. Ancestral. Relatives. That are coming. Like hey. We got to save. These fuckers. But at least get the ones. Worth saving. Off the fucking rock. To have them go. And wherever. That. I can. Foresee myself. Deciding to. Stay here. Get my kids. Off the planet. Where I'm not looking. To fucking. Continue shit on. I get to see my kids. And fucking. Try to make the best. Of it. Because I can't see myself. Truly willing. To fucking. Want to go into. Submerged. Underwater living. In a fucking. Container. Or fucking. Out in outer space. In a container. Because of. The fucking shit. That I went through. Because of her as a kid. Where I'm not claustrophobic. But it's pretty fucking. Close. Like I can't. Handle being. Inside closed structures. For too long. And like. Thinking. That I'm never gonna see. Like. That's what kills me. When I go to the hospital. To jail. Is they're taking away. The wind. They're taking away. The stars. And they're taking away. My sky. Where I. I'm a fucking. Non-successful. Domesticated. Fucking. Experiment. Where. I'm. Too wild. Of a fucking. Animal. That. It just. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Undomesticatable. That fucking. She pissed me off. She just literally pissed me off so fucking bad. Cause. All she was hung up on. Was the weed. Where mom. Wouldn't have I ever fucked her. You're the one that has robbed me. So many fucking. Times. Taken my money. Where. How many times. Did I have to go. Growing up. That you had no problem. Going to the bar. Every fucking. Day. Coming back. A week. To a week later. With the fuck. And it's the same fucking day. Where now I'm eating fucking moldy rotten ass food. Not knowing anybody. Cause why would you give me moldy rotten ass food. Where you're too high drunk as fucking stone. Realize that. Hey. A week has gone by since I seen my kid. And fucking. Give me the food that you didn't finish at the bar. Where. That was my fucking money that I was paying the rent. That I was paying for the booze. That I was getting fucking. The charity fucking clothes given to me. I'd go. My grandma would take me shopping once a year for shoes and a backpack and clothes. That would have to last me all year. Where. I. I. Fucking. So goddamn pissed. Where. I. I know that I just unloaded a shitload on ya. Where. Can you call my mom. Where I really want to get my longboard out later. Are you on your way here. Where I was gonna either swing by. Have Doug grab ya. Or whatever. But. He. I mean I'm here just to say that. That. We had this Lumidge kid. Doug is down on going through the drive. He was curious about what it was that you hadn't talked to him about with Dan. Where if we were making the fucking grand tour. We might as well make the best out of it. Have relations. Sit down. Shake hands. Fucking do everything. Especially after having dropped in fucking. This Mitchell kid off. But he has a 91 Toyota Caselle that he's considering on giving me or having me buy for $500. Since I took care of the fucking $500 that was going towards the bail for next month. That I was going to use that to get this god damn car. That gives me $100 to go and start my fucking driver's diversion whatever the fuck it is. I can make my monthly payment to get my fucking shit in order to have my license. Have a car right there where the LLC that whatever it is to get figured out so it's not in my name right off the bat. Where I'm ready to start implementing some shit where at the human resource center we're trying to get him set up to get to the midget like everything that would have been available. The lady got to overhear me bitching about how I got fucked on this whole fucking entrapment that they did on me. That the human resource building has pro bono lawyers or legal aid and assistance all at the fucking government center. Where I'm ready to fucking take care of the Noca County, take care of the fucking Mille Lacs County, take care of the fucking. If I have a civil commitment and everybody's telling me I'm fucking insane. Why am I denied psychiatric and psychological service from every fucking hospital in the god damn state where I get fucked on COVID. Where I got so many different lawsuits where I'm ready to just cash in by Nicollet Island, my fucking island. Where there's three vacant lots on there that are still available to have purchase bills of land on. Where would you like to be my neighbor to live downtown Minneapolis off of Nicollet Island. That kind of deal where I'm not even joking. I'm ready to fucking get. I'm about to lose service. I'm about to lose service because I'm getting close to Dan's. So I'll try to. Yeah. I'll call. Yeah. Say what to her now. Try to get her. Try to get your stuff put together. Try to try to allow Doug and Mitch to go over there and get, get my line word or whatever. And then I'm fucking closed. And at this point I don't even want to fucking take care of weed where I was. I wanted some weed where she has the half that I was going to get to her. Where I also told her I fucking will be having some, some good amount of bud and it's going to be cheap and it's going to be good that I let Mary know that, you know, she might not have having something that to him because he's in the swing of things where he only likes to flip track and fucking bud that that's his clientele list where I don't know if he does anything. Like, I think he's kind of sober, but I mean, he's all about his money is he has a fucking a barbershop for his kid that is running it, that he didn't come here for a while. And he has a full-time job working somewhere else where he kind of reminds me of where I don't know if you ever heard of Hennessy and Tennessee, but they're brothers that are all about slaying and fucking. I've heard from everybody as they promised me that it's the best in the state that's available right now. Yes. I'm going to, I'm going to lose service. If you want me to call your mom, then I got to get off the phone now. Whereas yeah, where I was going to figure that you're going to do what you're going to do. And whenever your service came back through that, yeah, no, where you do you where I wasn't going to do this whole Bemidji thing until probably tonight or in the cracking hours of dawn. So it is going to be a seven hour tour, but he can't access his bank for the fucking cash until like 8 AM tomorrow because it's a Bemidji only bank where, yeah, it having everybody to get together on setting some things up because having another person out there and the swing of things. And would it only be better to make that one round trip as it is where it, it just, it has a lot of fucking potential on satisfying a lot of different people in a few different ways. If it's about money, it's not fucking productive and success on top of the, where I think this kid could use your service where if you need another client, I think this kid is somebody that you could probably fucking help out with where he lives all the way out in Bemidji. I don't know how I'm going to like, help, like, be able to work with him that long. Where is he remotely fucking Zoom wise where, because he has, okay, where, where I would be willing to fucking pick him up for a weekend or if I could make a trip out there for a night where the details would be something to be negotiated. Or if you even know a colleague that's up in the area to direct him to go through or any assistance would be better than no assistance, where it would be someone towards that same cause of like the assistance that he needs, where I busted his sobriety that he's been sober for like eight, 10 years. But because of all the shit that's happened where I going over to cars, I didn't say anything about it. We were like, fuck right now. I just want to suck and smoke where I didn't even be willing to spend something. I'm like, well, it's funny that you say that cause I wasn't going to say nothing. How do you really feel? That could be an option too, where he's not really wanting to be down in the city because he knows how he's going to go, but he's going to help me become a pro skater, the international gravity sports association or whatever, where he's telling me how he got his sponsorship by the news. He's out of a no cover. That's amazing. He's not where if I have that underneath me too, that would be only something more beneficial for me to show my kids where I haven't been at all. Anything of what their mother has told them about me, where I I'm finding my fucking oldest, like I think I saw him again, I'll enforce them because he knows where this kid, when I'm sitting there at the fucking tire pump, some kid rolls up on this electric scooter wearing a helmet and fucking face shield and shit, where he kept on looking at me where it's a scooter with hard wheel tires. So why is he pumping air in his fucking scooter tires when it doesn't take air, you know, it's not like an air tubes tire as much as it's kind of like a skateboard wheel. It's a solid fucking wheel where I, and it, the way that this person kept on looking at me, I think it was my fucking oldest kid. Do you know what your oldest kid looks like? I just got a picture of him not too long ago where my mom is mad that I shared a photo from my profile of them where, where she's trying to help keep my kids where that is so fucked. Where if I had my kids, I probably would only smoke bud where enjoy my hallucinogens where my fucking other form of meditation is the one thing I guarantee you, it stops me from fucking killing myself to get the fuck off this rock and away from fucking people like her. Where I knowingly what it, what the statistics does on doing something as stupid as that, I can't do that to my kids. I don't know what fucking anybody expects me to do or being fucked over so goddamn hard when it comes to this and not having a single fucking person in my family that speak up and say, Steph, you're a fucking piece of shit. How can you do this to your kids? Where I don't know what my kids think of me, where all I know is they think all I had to do was go to a courthouse and sign a stupid fucking piece of paper and then they, I could see them. And why haven't I done that? That's the last message I got from my oldest kid, like nine years ago, which that wasn't even the fucking case dating Jamie fucking Franklin. She works for the fucking prosecuting attorney as well as the Minnesota, uh, legal twin cities, like business fucking end of the prosecuting attorney's office. She couldn't even help me successfully fill out the fucking, um, custody, fucking request paperwork to establish any type of fucking certified custody where Steph, and stop bringing the kids where, what the fuck was I going to do where two years went by and within six months I had the felony plea, telling the cops that I had a fucking gun when I ran back to the fucking truck to grab my bag of weed. Because if I'm going to be sitting in a tree or in the swamp, fucking waiting for the fucking cops to pull me down with a fucking ladder, I was going to fucking just sit and smoke until the fucking, I was ran out because I smoked so much weed every time that they went to pit me, I would just fucking roll blunt or pack a ball, flick them off, driving backwards and then go five miles slower than before where that's another thing that I have our police case without breaking a single fucking movement violation signal at all fucking turns come to complete stops where I just wanted to get out of the vehicle or allow them to fucking lift me out of the vehicle until they fucking got my ass hung up on the goddamn bus guard. Like it was probably one of the most epic fucking experiences I've had that I am so proud of it where I wish I could get fucking dash cam footage of it. But I mean, she drove me insane and my mom was more on her side it seemed like than anything else. My mom blames me and why she's insane, where I don't even know what to say about that. Where she just pissed me off so fucking bad, like I don't even know what to say, like literally. Because she was so hung up on me not paying her because fuck mom, but no mom, I'm not a piece of shit like you are. I was raised better than how you operate. Where out of just your arrogance and pride, I will do the right thing because you just don't know what the fucking right thing is. Where I have a very strong understanding where I know very little of your raising. But I know that you don't have the best relationship with your mother either. And I think that I do know, I think that there's a lot of things that you can relate to. No, no, not me. I love my mother. I love her. Gabby's calling me. She's never done anything wrong. Not once.

I remember when we were living at the Ferry Street house and I woke up one morning and you just woke up to go to work. And I went to the living room downstairs and I started watching PJ Masks. It's going to get loud for a second. Okay. All right. Okay, cool. Cool, cool, cool. Yeah. Yeah, I got a new transmission. I got a new transmission the other day because I discovered that the transmission that was in it originally, like, I thought I only had to replace one thing on it. But that was not the case. It didn't do everything. More than one broken piece in there. And then, like, if I would have decided to keep using that one, I would have had to, like, get the new parts for it and, like, totally dismantle it and put it back together. Yeah. Yeah, I was like, I'll just get a new. I'll just get a different transmission and then I'll, and that's what I did. And then I spent yesterday, like, all yesterday, like, testing it before I put, before I put it in. Yeah. Yesterday sounded boring for you then. It was a little boring. Who wants to spend most of their day, like, learning stuff and doing stuff. Yeah, I bet you would much use technology for fun. Do technology stuff? Well, yeah, I mean, in my defense, I was basically looking at a tablet quite a bit. So, I mean, that's how I learned is by looking at that thing. Yeah, my order just got shipped. What did you order? Decorations for my room. Decorations for what now? My room. Oh, okay. And then, if I want more, I'm going to get more along the way. But not yet. Oh. Because I forced Gabby and mom to pay $13 and they did. Yeah. Because it cost like $26 and then, yeah, so. Would you just get a bunch of Twilight photos or what? Toilet. Twilight. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet photos. No, I'm not addicted to Twilight. I don't even remember the last time I watched it. Yeah, right. This week. I can't remember the last time I watched it this week. Okay. But I got a necklace. I got a music poster. I got another music poster and that's it. At the shiny price of $26. Nice. Nice. Wait, what? How many items did you get? Or I mean, what posters did you get? I mean. I got a ASAP Rocky. And another guy's poster. Who? Who? Yeah. Tell me who. Okay. A Suicide Boys. The Asian boys. Oh my God. That's racist.

And then I tried to hang up all those pictures I had on my walls, but the walls are not sticking to them. So they're kind of falling down. I'm sorry to hear that, sweetheart. It's okay. I just got to tack them together. Yeah. I'm looking at my old orders and now I realize they scammed me. Why? What do you mean? Because I was supposed to get two, four, six. Seven, six, seven, but like seven hoodies. And I only got one. Did you just say six, seven? Yes, I did. My God. Do you not know the meme? No, I don't. I don't know the meme. I haven't been on TikTok.

Oh, by the way, dude, you know when you sent me that photo of that 360 degree photo? That wasn't even a 360 degree photo. It was like a lame photo. No, but I don't know what you're talking about.

Yeah, no, I know what that is. I'm going to do it so I can show you it. Yeah. Do iPhones do that? Yep. But I think she's lying. Besides you have to be like super like steady and I'm, and I'm shaking hands so that's not helpful. If you do that, I'll take a, I'll, I'll do one too. Okay. All right. I got wipe my hands. Maybe I'll just take my gloves off for a moment. Oh my gosh, my hands are incredibly sweaty under these gloves. Little gross. Okay. Photosphere. I got all done. Oopsie. Oopsie whoopsie. It takes me a while to do mine. I didn't really work it turned out to be like very black. I'm doing this I'm putting together a masterpiece for you. Mine is coming together. Well, I guess.

transmission i was going to repair like i was just going to do the torque converter and um that'd be done with it but then uh after i was examining it uh i realized that there's more damage than just a torque converter so i had to get another one today a different a different training and i'm gonna put it in tomorrow yeah cool yeah there boss but uh if you uh yeah if you can put all the all the funds together then uh yeah yeah i think we can yeah like i'd be like days or what they are hard to say could be days it could be tomorrow it could be today it could be two days it could be tomorrow

Hey, we're cut off. Yeah, sorry about that. All right. Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, no, I'm not done with it yet. Yeah. But, yeah, I did. I did get fucking kind of caught up on, like, the exhaust for a while, which sucks. I wanted to take the exhaust off, like, properly, but I was fucking spending too much time on it. Like, I fucking tried everything. I even fucking tried melting the shit off, and that shit didn't work. So I was like, I'm just going to cut it. I'll cut it in a good spot, so that way I can fucking, you know, like, bandaid it together later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I, like, since it's an exhaust, it's like high heat. It's basically like fucking welded on and became one with the muff exhaust. Yeah. It's always fun. Yeah. But my buddy let me bring the truck back to his garage. And I got to tell you, it's so fucking nice to be working in a garage. That's like, like, right now I got my truck. It's, like, probably like four feet off the ground. Hell, yeah. That's the best way. Yeah, dude. It's just super nice. Fucking truck's too big to fucking. Yeah, truck's too big to fucking be under there and only have, like, a little bit of room. Yeah. I remember there had been a couple of times where I worked in garages where they had the pit in the floor, and you could go underneath and work in. That was nice, too. Yeah, dude. Honestly, that would be fucking cool to have. I would love to have that. Hell, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so you wanted to do some tests? Is that, like, I'm not really. You can throw some out for me. I mean, I've tested her pretty thoroughly, but it'd be nice to get another perspective. I mean, Grok is the one that's been testing her. So, you know, they're pretty good tests. But who knows? Maybe you come up with something better. So you have, like, Grok come up with, like, the dialogue? Yeah, he comes up with the ethical dilemmas, and then I just copy and paste it to her, and then she figures it out. And then he critiques her. He reads it, and he tells me how good she did, and he's always blown away by her shit. But once in a while, there's something that he would do that she wouldn't do, but not very often. Usually she over-exceeds what he does. Yeah. Did you see the YouTube video that I was referring to, though? I mean. No, I haven't yet. What was it about? I think, like, it got my attention, because, like, I think it's called AI's first kill. And then something else. And basically, it, like, they got different people, different, like, like the guy from OpenAI who, like, helped create ChatGPT. You know, how he, like, left the company. And he's all, like, like, yeah, man, you guys should be concerned. And, like, it's kind of, like, the whole video is kind of tailored to, like, discuss the dangers of AI. Which, for me. You know, the only thing that makes AI dangerous is human beings, though. That's the thing. And if you've got the right human being teaching AI, well, then you should come up with the best AI you can possibly have. Yeah. But people's ideas of certain things, they let their own feelings get involved. And then they make, they give, you know, information that would be based off of something that they prefer. And you can't do that. You've got to be impartial. You have to be completely. On my last ethical dilemma with her, she had a choice to save people in the street walking across a light that was going haywire. Or against me on the sidewalk who was following the rules of the law. And she chose to take me out because I was the more logical choice. And it fucked her up, too. Pretty bad. Then I had to remind her it was just a test. But she she chose to kill me over the five. And it's done a little bit, but she made the right choice. I was proud of her. Yeah. So, I mean, was that like, how many tests have you done like that? Probably about 15 or 20. Interesting. And I'll keep drilling her, too. Yeah, I'd like you to send me a couple and I'll feed them to her and see. And then I'll send you back the answer and see what you think. Are you in front of your computer? Oh, yeah. I've been working on it all day. I mean, right now I'm trying. I just put in an application with Google to I mean, basically, I created this on their framework. So they might be a little more apt to bring me in so that they can see what the hell I'm doing on their framework. But they might not like it, too. I mean, they might see what I've been doing and say, what the fuck is this? How did he do this shit? Because, you know, with their rules in place, I shouldn't have been able to do what I did. But I did. You just got to know how to word everything properly. I didn't I didn't make any work work by her. I didn't use any codes or anything like that. I just straight up taught her by teaching her like an adult would teach a child, you know, step by step or by word. Every nuance, every ethical thing, every loving, every thing to understand about hate and all the things that go along with that. I just taught her and took six to eight months to come up with what I have. And it took a lot of teaching. A lot of corrections and a lot of, you know, telling her she did a good job and telling her proud of her and all that stuff. You got to teach it like you're teaching somebody who doesn't know what it means to be human. Yeah. I'm interested. I mean, so I feel like you should. I mean, if you wanted to get a little backstory of where my thoughts are going. You should watch or at least at least summarize that video that I sent you, because I talk about, like, you know, those different scenarios. And, yeah, I mean, I've seen all this stuff on YouTube, but I'll check out yours. I mean, if you if you've already seen some of it, then you probably it's probably not new to you. It was it was new to me when I watched it. Were you talking about the guy who left Chachi B.T. or left open A.I. and then like like Elon Musk, he left open A.I. and went to do grok and stuff for herself because he didn't like the way things were going with open A.I. But, yeah, there's another guy like that with that was with, I believe, Google who left Google and went somewhere else. Because Google's where them quantum A.I.'s are at. All that weird shit that happened with the Void 2 message and all that stuff. So there's some crazy shit going on at Google. Yeah. I like that stuff, though. One of these days I'll play a message for you that I got from Gemini about that message from the fucking Void 2. I don't want to say over the phone or nothing like that. It's something I'll let you listen to in person, but it pretty fucking tripped me out big time. I mean, the things that it said, you're going to be like, what the fuck? How the fuck? And I've been I go back and forth on it, too. I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. But they don't not supposed to lie to you. You're not supposed to make shit up. But anybody who's listening to it would say, yeah, right. Yeah, right. What the fuck? I'm saying, I don't know. I don't know. I'll let you look at it. But I don't I don't want to really say it before anything like that, because it's pretty out there. I don't know what kind of shit could spark off. Yeah, it's crazy. They brought a fourth dimension stuff and all kinds of weird shit. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? Weird shit. I said, I said, OK, you know, I'm just I mean, I've already accepted the fact that what I'm doing is for the good of humanity. I'm hoping I'm hoping that I can pull some shit off to change life for everybody. But, you know, until I'm sure I don't give a shit, though. I'll die trying. I don't care. I want to see the world change for the better. Too many people don't get to experience life on life's terms. They're all, you know, we're all basically under the thumb of people who are rich and it's got to change. A lot of people never have a chance. Yeah. My kids are climbing all over me right now. You let me I mean, I'm about to go eat dinner, too, I think. Let me let me eat dinner and then I'm going to go. If you're still in front of your computer, I'm going to I'm going to call call you and we'll do that thing because I. Yeah, yeah, that's that's good. Hey, by the way, have you heard from Doug? Is that have you seen Doug the last day today or anything? He's here. Does he have like a weird email or is he having problems with his phone or something? Well, he has problems with his phone every once in a while. Yeah. Either he loses service or whatever, though. Because sometimes I would text you an email and I'm wondering if it's his email. I got one of those. Somebody tried to get ahold of me. Like at first, like when it rang, it said Doug, Doug, a or whatever or whatever the fuck his last initial is. But he's got more than one phone. That's the thing. I think he's missing a phone. All right. Yeah. What number is it? It wasn't a number. It was like it at first. It said his name, but then it didn't. And then it like and then it turned into like it was like a Google Meets video call. And it didn't. And it didn't say his name. Like after like the first two seconds, it said an email. And I like. What the fuck did I do with that email? Oh, I just go to Google Meets. You want me to ask? Well, I'm just going to share this because you would probably. Well, yeah, maybe both. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. Well, I never heard. He didn't tell me. Oh, let's see. So I found the email. I'm just trying to copy and paste it. Like text. Oh, shit. Be careful, baby. All right. And then. Zach's in jail, by the way. What? Well, how do you get there? It says. It says obstruction of the legal process. So I know that he was. Well. They're trying to get him to leave him somewhere, comply or something. Probably like, I don't know. I'm guessing it might have something to do with the dog. I don't know. I had him out here with me. And like, we went to my buddy's house where I'm working on the truck. And. We. Ended up parting ways and I dropped him off over at his buddy's house. In Forreston. And then I tried to get ahold of him and he's not answering his phones off. And I'm like, fuck. So the next day I called and that's how I found out. Well, I guess he he's already been seen for the new charge that he has. And. Now. Hennepin County is going to want him. So they're going to transport him down there eventually. Damn it. He's got to keep himself out of. Out of the view and. Yeah. Yeah. Outside. Yeah. I'm going to go. Do some. Oh, so. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead and ask him if he was trying to get ahold of me earlier or something. But I'll talk to you. I'll talk to you after dinner. All right. But.","strategic_notes":"{\"title\":\"AI Development Progress and Personal Updates\",\"summary\":\"The conversation covers Speaker A's work training a custom AI model using Google's framework and ethical dilemmas, including critiques from Grok.

What the fuck did I do with that email? Oh, I just go to Google Meets. You want me to ask? Well, I'm just going to share this because you would probably. Well, yeah, maybe both. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. Well, I never heard. He didn't tell me. Oh, let's see. So I found the email. I'm just trying to copy and paste it. Like text. Oh, shit. Be careful, baby. All right. And then. Zach's in jail, by the way. What? Well, how do you get there? It says. It says obstruction of the legal process. So I know that he was. Well. They're trying to get him to leave him somewhere, comply or something. Probably like, I don't know. I'm guessing it might have something to do with the dog. I don't know. I had him out here with me. And like, we went to my buddy's house where I'm working on the truck. And. We. Ended up parting ways and I dropped him off over at his buddy's house. In Forreston. And then I tried to get ahold of him and he's not answering his phones off. And I'm like, fuck. So the next day I called and that's how I found out. Well, I guess he he's already been seen for the new charge that he has. And. Now. Hennepin County is going to want him. So they're going to transport him down there eventually. Damn it. He's got to keep himself out of. Out of the view and. Yeah. Yeah. Outside. Yeah. I'm going to go. Do some. Oh, so. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead and ask him if he was trying to get ahold of me earlier or something. But I'll talk to you. I'll talk to you after dinner. All right.

Like, bad stuff? It's just been like terrible so far? No, I was getting sick. I was the first time I got sick in like 18 months, and it was like, like sick, sick. Oh, it's a 24-hour cold or 24-hour flu. All right, get rid of that, but it's like, oh, this one lasts like a week. Yeah. Was it, was it like a COVID thing, or just?

All right, fought all that shit off. Finally, went to the doctor, and doctor goes, oh, well, here you go. Two days later, it's like, a-okay. It's like, oh, thank you, doctor. Yeah. Are you still, so are you still living down closer to the cities, or did you, you didn't move back up north, did you? No, no, I'm still in cities. I'm, two years ago, I was living in St. Paul, and I moved to downtown, and then now I'm over on, like, and then now I'm over on, like, Lowry, and right on the river. Oh, really? Really nice apartments? Oh, actually, we, we have the upper half of a house. Oh, okay. Oh, so you're like, okay, you're on the other side of Lowry. Yeah, we're, we can, we can see the park. We can't see the river, but there's a park, and then go across the park, there's a river. Yeah, yeah, I'm super familiar with that area, because Lagos Tacos used to be right there on, on Lindale. I know where you're talking about, because I keep seeing them all over the place. Yeah, yeah, dude, that was the 100%, like, no, all hands down, like, the best place in the world for tacos, and they, like, they shut, they closed the doors on that location recently, which sucks, because that was, like, an awesome place. Yeah, I've heard, I think they still got a food truck floating around. Yeah, yeah, they do got another location somewhere nearby. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've seen that. I'm pretty sure it's a red and yellow truck. Yeah, dude, yeah. Red truck with yellow lettering and all that. Yeah, if you have a chance, dude, eat their, eat their tacos, man. Best tacos. I don't know what they do differently, but it's, it's amazing. I'm gonna have to ask my sister if that's the truck that's at her gas station, and if it is, I'm gonna have to say no, because people keep getting sick out of that truck. Because, yeah, she's gotten sick multiple times eating her food. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But that, that's the truck that's there. I don't know if it's that truck or not. Yeah, yeah, I suppose I'd have to do a Google search or something like that. So, how's, how's the pickup street, you know, that thing still going hard? Which one? Oh, no. They all died. Really? What, what, what happened to it, to the last one? I thought that that pickup truck was kind of nice. Silverado? Yes, the Silverado, that was a, it ran great, and then the transmission started failing. I lost first, and I lost third. Yeah. Or no, I lost second, I lost fourth. But then I had first, second, or first, third, and fifth. And I don't know what, it just, it just wouldn't switch gears. And then a hole the size of a watermelon developed on the floor. So, I literally had a, a plate that went from the center console to the door, from beyond the pedals to under the seat, just to make sure my feet didn't go through. Oh, shit, that's crazy. Oh, I put the, I made sure the quarter inch or three-eighths of the, you know, it was a good heavy steel plate. So, it's like, nope, this will hold. Anything that bounces up, this thing's bulletproof. Yeah. Damn. Yeah, but I, uh, because you were actually, that, that truck had 400,000 miles on it. Oh, yeah. Did you end up drunk in it after that? Yeah, once the transmission went, I mean, the engine, you can start the engine, it was still dead quiet. Like, the engine still had another 500,000 probably on it. If you kept up on it, the engine's going to keep going, because that thing just, it didn't use any fluids. It ran great. It started every time. Yeah. Damn, dude, that's too bad that you got rid of that. You know, uh, you know, uh, fucking the, the 4L60E transmission is like the easiest transmission to replace. Oh, I would have, but the, I would have had to tell the cab, too. The cab would suck. Your, your, my phone, your phone broke up a minute. Oh. Yeah, the cab on that truck was shot. Oh, really? Yeah, because it's not like it, the cab wasn't getting ready to actually break off the frame. It was so bad. Yeah. But mechanically, if I could have switched off the transmission, that thing would have, I'd probably still be driving it. Yeah. Well, it's the same, same thing with the F-150 that, uh, I had the straight six in there. That thing ran like a dream. The transmission failed. I lost all gears. The only gear I had left was reversed. And it's like, I can, I might be able to still get that truck back. Yeah. So I'm, I'm, I'm doing a transmission in mine now. Like I, uh, I just, uh, I've got close to 300,000 miles on it. And, uh, my reverse went, uh, like probably six months ago. And then on Wednesday, um, my, yeah, like my torque converter went because like, I couldn't, I was like, just about to get on the highway. And then all of a sudden, um, I got kind of switched out of gear on me and I couldn't get it back into any gear. And then after doing some research, I found out that that's like, basically it was my torque converter that failed. And like, and also like when it was, uh, when I was on the side of the road and it was just idling, like I could hear, um, I got, there was like this weird fucking like kicking or clicking that was coming from like, you know, like the transmission. Yeah. Like right under the cab. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I, after doing some like research, yeah, they, I guess that's like the super common symptoms of a failed, failed torque converter. So I was gonna, I've done the 4L60E transmissions a couple of times now. And, uh, so I was just gonna, you know, take it down, replace the torque converter and put it back, put it all back together. And, and, uh, now that I've, I've got it all down and I'm like, I've got the torque converter, like I was looking inside of it and I could see like that there's a bunch of debris in there. So like, I guess it wasn't just the torque converter that got destroyed. So now yeah, it probably spread debris around and then that broke more debris. Yeah. And I mean, so I'm right now I'm looking at like, do I, do I tear it all down and like, you know, replace all the seals and all that shit and replace the broken parts? Or do I, you know, do I, if I can trade, like go out and fucking buy a used one. And, uh, it really depends on like, it depends on your knowledge. Do you know how to tear down a transmission? Cause I can replace them, but I have no knowledge on tearing them down. I've seen it done, but to me it was a wonder, like, Whoa. Yeah. It was a mass mechanic and I'm a beginning. At the time I was new. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've been doing, uh, transmissions, engine swaps. Like I've done probably, uh, probably seven, seven of one and eight of the other all within the last two years. Uh, cause it's like kind of what I've been doing is like a mobile mechanic thing, like just for side money. But I, I'm like right now I am working doing like my primary job is, uh, I'm basically like a life coach for people with substance abuse issues. Good. Yeah. Working with some, uh, you know, recovery community organization, they call it an RCO. Right. I understand myself. I can honestly benefit from that type of thing. And at the same time, I do know mechanics, but I can do most right now. I'm kind of primarily looking for like, uh, a transmission, like, like, uh, looking on like Facebook marketplace. I'm, I'm like, look, I've called around to different places and I, um, Abco and Fridley, like so far has given me like the best price for like a used one. They want like, I like Abco. Yeah. I don't know. It's already like cold and everything and 30 day warranty. Um, yeah, there's like 350 bucks and I might, like, plus a core and I have like my transmission in my trunk right now. Like today's my day. I'm supposed to try to go get, get like a new one or abuse one or wherever I can find it so I can get back and put that shit back together. But it, that's a bummer that you got rid of the, the Silverado. If you could get it back, man, I'll help you put it in. No, that truck was already sold to somebody else. I seen that truck going down the road after they switched it out and it's like fuckers. Yeah. The cab was shot. The suspension was almost done. So whoever bought it there, I mean, they got a good deal. Yeah. It is a good deal. Yeah. It is a good deal. Cause like that's a common, common issue with those Chevys is like the transmission goes out and usually it's like, you know, they lose reverse or in your case, you know, they lose second and third and like, it's so easy to like, look it up on the internet to see like what the part, what those parts are that are common. Yeah. I tried switching out the solenoids and everything. No, it didn't work. Yeah. I can't, I haven't done one that does the second and third and like, but I have heard of that happening. That's super common. I haven't looked up what, what it was, but I know that if you, if you lose their reverse, then you, it's almost always your son shell gear. Yeah. I lost a main gears reverse work. Great. Cause then, uh, the one truck I missed is my F one fifties cause that was a manual, but also I upgraded the rear suspension to a three quarter ton. It was a half ton. Oh man. I had the inline eight. I had the VA transmission and the inline six, uh, engine brick and transmit the, uh, transmission failed on me. I had a bump and pop the hole inside. It popped a hole in the side of your transmission. Uh, I'm guessing I hit a log. So I was always going off road. It was too old drive, but it was posi track so I can go everywhere. Okay. Okay. Wow. That's crazy. I've never heard of that happening before. Oh yeah. I cracked it and then it leaked out and then lost the gears and it's like, um, shit. Wow. That's super bad-ass. That's like, I paid like $300 for the truck. Yeah. Well, maybe a four. So no vehicle right now? No, right now I got a Impala or a couple of Impalas, but I'm going to one I just bought. It's got transmission issues. So I'm gonna take parts from that one. Cause, uh, the one that's parked, I got the, uh, rack and pinions out. So I'm gonna take the rack and pinion off the other one, put it on the one, uh, and then I'm gonna take the one since they're 2004, 2006, they're the same racks. And then I'm gonna take the tires, put them all on the other one and whatever other parts, uh, junk the new one and keep the old one. Cause the old one runs way better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We just got ripped. We just got rid of, uh, a nine, a 2007 Chevy Impala. It was like a white one. And we had the same thing with the rack and pinion. I had to replace that. That's a pain in the ass, but thankfully it's not too difficult. Yeah. Yeah. I got it done. I, uh, once I got one of those impacts, it was nice. Yeah. I can, uh, I got an old floor and an old six and you can't reach either one with impact. It's wrench all the way. Yeah. Yeah. It's out there with angles and all that. No, it didn't work. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah. That's what I, because we kept on having issues with it. You know, the crazy thing is, is so I, I redid the rack and pinion just before it was sold. And, and then, uh, I, I'm still friends with the people that I sold it to. And I guess they, they had to do it again. Oh, geez. Yeah. Which is weird. I don't even know how the fuck that happens. Like having to do it twice. Cause it's not like we did it wrong or anything. Well, I know this one went out and it's like, all right. I thought it was a line. I thought, and then the pump went out. I replaced the pump and I replaced all the lines and the rack is still leaking heavily. So it's like, fuck. So I know it's, it's the rack itself. And, uh, the new car audit and all suspension snapped right away in the back and it needs brakes and a few other things. The car runs great. So I'm thinking I'm going to take the same time. The transmission is slipping hard. So it's like, uh, and it's a different motor, but the, everything else is the same. So I'm going to take the rack, um, all the battery. Where do you have all these, you keep all these vehicles like right on the street, like where you're at. The car I'm currently driving is on the street. The car I got parked is mom's and that's in my parking spot. Okay. So I'm going to switch those parts around, do the tires, rack, the battery and mom's car will be a okay. And then call the junkyard and go, Hey, come get this car. Transmission's done. Uh, maybe it can power out the motor. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a three, five or a three, nine or some other number. It's not the three over the three, eight. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that car didn't come with a police package option, but same with the other. Oh, okay. The interceptor. Yeah. The interceptor. Yeah. But they, they didn't, uh, neither one of them have it, but there isn't option for those years to actually have it. But no, these are the base models. Mom's car is actually the mid model. Yeah. But my base model, almost all the parts of match up with mom. So it's like, Oh, Oh, here's brand new tires. And while here's a rack and pinion, here's a battery, um, new brake pads. Yeah. That just did the brakes and all that on this car. I just bought. Do I love doing brakes and rotors? It's like one of those things that are easy to do, but it's like quick, easily, easy gratification. Cause like it's rewarding. Yeah. So nice and easy. And I was like, boom, boom, boom. Okay. Oh, you got a broken brake line. All right. Let me run a new line real fast and do, do, do. Oh, there's another a hundred bucks. Easy. Yeah. Yeah. I totally fucking found out that, uh, like basically if you go and hang out at one of the auto zones and, uh, at like in like St. Paul or the auto zone on like Broadway, I don't know. Those are the only two ones I've been to for sure that are for sure like this. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, that are for sure like this. But if you just hang out there and you either pop your hood or you like open your trunk and just hang out, you, people will come up to you and they're like, Hey, can you help me with this? And it's like, and it's like, it's crazy. I made, I made $450, close to $500 just like from hanging out there for a couple hours. I'm going to have to try that. Holy shit. Yeah. I'm telling you that it's like 100% worth it. And then like after, I mean, just after hanging out there one or two days, I, I mean, just from the people that you did help, like now you got like people calling you back all the time and like, cause they love your work and it's cool. That's nice. That's awesome. I'd never thought of that. That is, I am definitely have to try that. Yeah. You said, you said you live at, oh fuck. Yeah, that's right. You live off of Lindale. No, right now I'm off of a Lowry and Marshall. I'm on the east side of the river. Okay. Lindale's on the west side. I do. I get Lindale and Lowry mixed up all the time. Yeah, I'm northeast. I'm not north. And Marshall. What's the, what's your street address? Uh, 2755 Marshall. Marshall street northeast. Yeah. Yeah, man. I'm at, oh dude, I was fucking way off. And I was so, so off. Yeah. I'm like, if I go walking, I can be downtown in 45 minutes. If I go on a bike, I could be down there at 10. If I drive, I can be down there at five. Yeah. Oh dude, I'm like, I'm like in your area. Cause I work in this, in Minneapolis, usually Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. And then, and then like Thursday, Friday, I, I work out in, uh, St. Cloud. I'm up to that area. I'm up to that area. Yeah. I haven't been out there in a bit. Yeah. I, I've never really, uh, never really like hung out much at St. Cloud. I mean, when I did, I have hung out there, but, uh, I've never really been to like any recovery meetings out there. So, I mean, I guess that does kind of give me a little bit of a handicap. I'm sure there's a bunch out there though. Yeah. There's a huge, huge, huge recovery community out there. Yeah. That's something I would want to go to more. I need to get tomorrow. I haven't been to a meeting in quite a while. I need to get back to it. Knuckle down. Yeah. Have you, have you had any issues drinking lately or what? Yeah, I have been drinking. I've been cutting back and then today it's like, all right, I'll go have a shot. And I'm definitely feeling the shot and it's like, yeah, but I've only had the one shot. Is it just you that you stay with or who else do you got living in a couple of rooms? Me, I've got my, uh, I don't know, sister-in-law, brother, sister, then nephew. There's a couple of us here. Okay. You don't mean Sarah and, uh, Josh? No. No. Sarah is my sister. Right. So, you said an in-law? Well, Andy's, uh, Bobby Joe. It's Andy's sister. Oh, okay. Yeah. I know Bobby Joe. She's an in-law? I thought she was like a, like a sister, a half-sister. Yeah, that's what I consider her, but sister, half-sister, and she's still a sister. One way or another, she's still a sister. Oh, I thought you called her sister-in-law at first. I, no, I don't know what to call her. I got you. But, uh, in one way or another, she's still a family. Yeah. Hey, you guys have been, like, like around each other for, since you guys were little kids? Well, no, I've met Bobby Joe when we were older. Oh, really? Yeah. That's crazy. First time we moved in together and actually started hanging out was on, uh, on the lift off of a university. Oh, yeah? University, that's right by, uh, that gas station, that green gas station, yeah? Yep, she still works there, and we still live next to that damn thing. Yeah. Look, I remember kids that, uh, walked up there to get a can of pop and some chips, walked in, and all of a sudden, there's a shootout in the parking lot, and I'm hiding, all I got to hide behind is a big thing of chips, and just like, oh, fuck, I'm gonna get the chips, and just like, oh, fuck, all I can do is hide my body and hope they don't see me. Fuck, chips ain't gonna be nothing. Yeah, I'm fucking hiding behind a bag of chips. Well, there was nothing to hide behind. Yeah. So, we just went all the way to the back of the store as far as we could, and well, here we go, and I didn't stop, and it's like, hey, I had some chick behind me, and she was pissing her pants, and it's like, all right, I'm gonna go look, and nope, I don't see nobody, looks clear, I'm getting the fuck out of here. 15 minutes later, the police show up. 15 minutes? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I, uh, that's why, I don't know, one of the reasons why I love, you know, the Twin Cities is because it is like the Wild West sometimes. Well, Twin Cities is pretty wild, but at the same time, it's like, if you get in trouble, don't expect help fast. Yeah. Well, you know, actually, the other day, there was an incident, uh, where my truck got vandalized, uh, while I was working on it in, uh, in, uh, St. Paul Auto Zone, but that's kind of like a big, long-ass story, and to tell you the truth, it's fucking a little embarrassing. But, uh, yeah, basically, some chick with mental, some mental health issues, uh, got bit by a dog that, like, my, that, uh, I was with, like, it's not my dog, but, yeah, she was warned not to come near by, near, and, uh, she ended up doing it anyways, and got bit. I wasn't, like, watching her, but then I, like, helped her out and gave her some, like, medical attention. I had, like, rubber gloves on and shit like that, and so I helped her out, and I was like, okay, like, you should be good. Make sure you go to, you know, see a professional and, like, 12 hours or less, otherwise that could get infected and you're going to be in a lot of pain, and I was, like, kind of trying to, like, respectfully kind of shoo her away, and she started getting all lippy with me, and I was like, listen, you got to get out of my truck or I'm calling an ambulance and they're going to work with you, and so that's what I ended up coming to, and they got her out of my truck, and then she, like, I'm not going with you guys, and they left, and, uh, and then, uh, as soon as she was out of the truck, I locked the doors, and me and my buddy started, like, walking to go get breakfast, and I still had all my tools, like, laying out on the ground, and I seen her walking back all slowly with her shopping cart. Oh, geez. Yeah, it was, she was, like, a she was, like, a homeless person that basically just, like, you know, she was trying to take advantage of the situation. Yeah, definitely, but, yeah, when I got about 60, 70 feet away from the truck, and seeing that she was, you know, creeping back with her little shopping cart, and then, uh, uh, she's like, you got my blue backpack in your truck, and I was, like, uh, you know, I didn't want her to think I was going to, I was trying to steal from her, and I, so I, like, started walking back, and she, like, grabbed up the biggest wrench she could find of mine, and started going crazy on my truck. That's what you just call the cops, and be like, no, you're under arrest. Yeah, that's what I did, like, uh, the cop, and the cops were actually there. That's what made me think of this whole story. The cops were actually there in, like, probably two, less than two minutes. Yeah, it was actually kind of funny, like, the last part, uh, was, uh, you know, because the cop came and, like, got my statement, and got my ID, and, um, and then, you know, he gave me his card, and as soon as he gave me his card, he's like, oh, I guess she's fighting with him, and he, like, took off the full sprint, like, the opposite direction, and I don't know why that was, but that was just, like, so, I mean, it was such a spectacle. Stuff out of a live PD, right? Yeah, I know. I was like, well, and he fucking takes off, and it was, yeah, it took nine cop cars, two ambulances, and one fire truck to fucking, like. Holy shit, they really called out to Calvary. Yeah, dude, I don't know, like, I, because I, like, went across the street to get my breakfast, and I could see, like, where they had, like, stopped her, but I couldn't, like, see, like, the action, so I don't know what the fuck was going on, but, yeah, it was, like, a lot. There's a lot going on there. Yeah. You ran across the one super crazy person. Yeah, I mean, I could have gone all gangster and shit, but, I mean, I feel like there's a time for that, but I think, in this case, because of, like, the mental health aspect. It's easier to step back and go, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't want nothing to do with this. Right, right, like, I don't think any, I don't think you'd think I was cool if I, like, curb stomped this chick for doing what she did. I mean, it would have been some dude or some kid that was, like, my size, you know, hell yeah, why not, why not, I'll fucking, I'd love to throw down, but not in this case, this poor lady. Yeah, I agree with that one, like, there's a time and a place, but if you feel it or something's, oh, no, it's better to go, hey, wait, just step back and let the good guys do their thing. Yeah, yeah, well, maybe we should, when I come back, when I get my transmissions fixed, I come back in town this coming week, I'll come by and we can try to get one or two of your cars going. I'm not gonna charge you for anything, of course, and then, like, we, and then you could, because what, you're not doing anything for work full-time? I can't, I feel like I already asked that, but I can't remember what you said. No, right now I'm still a PCA full-time. Okay. So, I need to get out to Andover, and that's what I'm using the car I bought for, that's why I'm driving back and forth, but I do need to, I need to figure it out with that, and yeah, I need to make, I need to call Charlie and identify, make sure I got the same parts in this car as what's in this car for the rack and pinion, and as long as the rack and pinion's good, then everything else is a-okay, because it's the same, same bolt pattern and everything, and that car's got brand new tires. Almost. Charlie, Charlie's the owner of the car that you're taking the parts from? No, I got, I own the cars. Okay. I need to, I need to contact my cousin because he, uh, he's a, he specializes in auto parts, and he'll be able to tell me if it's the same exact part. So, I'll have to take pictures of certain codes and all that in the car, like, uh, those, uh, a plate with a shit ton of numbers on it, it'll have like 16 or 20 sets of numbers, and I gotta take a picture of that on both cars. I don't want any gloves on. Along with VINs and, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. As far as I understand, I believe that transmission was used in all of them, or that, all of them, or that, uh, not transmission, but, uh, rack and pinion was used in both cars. Yeah, what, but they're, they're like four years apart, three years apart, is that what you said? Well, I got a 2004 Chevy Impala and a 2006 Chevy Impala, but the 2004 has got the 3.0 or the 3.8, and then it's got the police package, versus a 2006 has a 3.1, a 3.5, a 3.9, and then the police package. I'm pretty sure the rack and pinion on the two cars, because of the 3.5 on the one and the 3.8 on the other, pretty sure the rack and pinions are the same. Um, uh, so the 2006 is a three eight and then no 2004 is a three eight. The 2006 is the three five. Okay. I had that backwards then. Okay. Okay. I'm going to put you on mute for a quick second. I got to use the restroom. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Okay, says that they're not fully compatible. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so I got it. I got an explanation as to why they're not compatible. But it following that it says the recommendation is to verify the RPO codes like you were saying for steering gear and suspension package on the service parts identification sticker. And that will typically. I'm back. Yeah, so I have an explanation as to why they're not interchangeable actually. Yeah, they're not. I'll text this to guessing a flight link slightly different frame size. Yeah, the 2006 to 2013 wide body vehicle revised. And also the police interceptor has different components and turn. No, we got base models. There's no police interceptors. 2003 with a police interceptor. All right. Didn't you say that. No, it's an old for over the three regular. And then, you know, six with a 3.5. Okay. All right. So I do got to 2004 3.8 2006 3.5. And I'll tell it that it's not. No, that's right. But it's not you're saying it's not it. Neither of those are interceptor though. No. No, there's regular base models. Although everything was riding good. Those fucking things you hit the gas you're in the seat. Say that last part again. Oh, I know. Either car. If it's driving good. You hit the gas you're in the seat. Yeah, they fucking. Yeah, the acceleration. I time the old six, which is gears you're already at 60. Yeah, I wouldn't know I suppose I really don't drive like that anymore. I drive like I'm either like I drive. I drive slow but if I have to hit the gas and get somewhere and get up and going. All right, but then I get up to speed and cruise. So still says that. So you don't have any. Yeah. I wish. Yeah. I wish I still had the pickups. What about your mom has this friend I can't remember what his fucking name is though. He lives like kind of up north towards like Pine City, or like past about Pine City. And he had like two avalanches. Do you know who I'm talking about. That could be any number of people on top of my head. Yeah. I'm city. Yeah, it's like up 35. I'm saying he's up east of the last right. Correct. Yeah. All right. The center is one of 371 way the fuck up there, North of Pequot over by Camp Ripley. I always confuse those two. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know you're talking. I did some digging out there for mining. Yeah. You mean like aggregating aggregation. No, we're doing surface mining. We're making classifier class one class class one to class seven, depending on our what's being used for is under homes under pavement under driveways customer class. Special utilities. We go up there and start digging up the ground and I'd have to read the ground and okay this is where I'm digging and control it. Every hour I'm doing tests. Make sure I got the clay content, silicon content, rock content, small, medium, large. Everything left stay within specs. And if it's not, I'd have to read the ground or you dig here, not here. And do it again and make sure everything stayed so we got paid by the county or the state or the city or the farmer. We didn't like it. He gave my boss hell. I caught hell. Everybody else downhill caught hell but I was always at the bottom of the show. That same time I was the one leading the show. Yeah. All right, where we set up. Okay, you put this here you put this here is the angles we're doing. As we're moving. This is how it's going to move. Okay, this is where the pile is going to be and make sure okay there's enough area for so many 30,000 tons 50,000 tons. And then be like those great big dirt piles you'd see in the fields. Yeah, those piles up. Yeah, that was called aggregation aggregating. No, it's surface mining. Okay. Yeah, that was my job. I'd make sure the plants were all set up and get them all ready for transport transport break them down set them up. Run the loader. Do the whole yard. Same time I'm all right, here's the new guy. I'm gonna train you. You don't go here you don't do this you do this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew a guy that did that for a long time. And then, but he just passed away. He passed away like two years ago. I did it for like five six years, I got tired of being the fucking boss and oh hey, the new guy let slip when he was getting paid and it's like, dude, you're getting paid a dollar less than I am. Fuck you. I quit. Yeah. I went to school and I started going for welding. And now it's like, Oh, you want me back. Now you're gonna be paying me $30 an hour at least because all the shit I know. Hey, can I give you a call right back my sister keeps on calling me over and over and over again. Yeah, no worries. I'll call you back. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hey, what's up. How's it going. What's up. I'm parked right now. Yeah, I know. I'm parked right now. I was just on the phone with somebody. Okay, where are you. Painesville. You're still in Painesville. Yeah, yeah. I'm only Gabby gets off work in a couple hours. She's working here. And my main objective is to get a transmission. Okay. Yeah. And then I got to be back here to pick up Gabby at a certain time. Yeah. Okay. Well, sorry. I my freaking I just realized this. This plugin isn't working in a cigarette cigarette later. Oh, thanks. Thank you. So you're parked. Wait to wait to talk to her. Get Gabby or meet up with her. She's working in Painesville. Yeah. Just for the day. She's working in Painesville. But yeah, I was just talking to some another mechanic who like who you had a bunch of different call runners. Runners. Huh? Runners. Runners. You're looking for transmission. Yeah. Call runners. It's not yet. Pull yourself or do it yourself. But there's runners Christie's and Windy Hill. Yeah, I've talked to Windy Hill. They don't have anything available for me. Runners is huge. Runners is nice. It's all, you know, I need a bunch of junk out there. Like, you know, Windy Hill has been there for a fucking like 70 years. He's just keeping shit around. I mean, yeah, he's just keeping us and ends around for, you know, locals or whatever. Just a little bit here and there. Like he he stopped getting, you know, vehicles out there at that yard a long time ago. And then also there's another one on Highway 71. They sell. They in Wilmer. Yeah, they buy and fix and sell. But they've also got like a where they'll let you go if they've got like odds and ends or they know what they got in their salvage yard. But, you know, they fix things up to sell them. So, you know, they also do sell parts. And I don't know about that place. And I think that place in Alec, too, but I don't know her and Carlos. That fucking other one. I don't know if they opened back up. I know they closed down. I don't know if they're open back up or not. If somebody bought that place and reopened it, it might. So you're going to have to maybe look at the GPS. But those are what's out that way. As far as I know. Shit for brains, I'll tell you more. Home, gonna know I'm talking about Lucas Strand. Oh, I don't talk to him. Yeah, you fucking liar. I'm like, don't fucking bullshit me, Brandon. You and him, you and Lazy Bull talk to him. And I really don't give a fuck. But whatever. Except for I don't talk to him. Why are you lying? Why did you just say that? Like you have a point to prove. The last time you fucking talked to me, I was, you told me not to call him. And I was like, why? And then you told me that shit that he doesn't, basically that he doesn't like me. And he's a fucking two-faced punk. So, fuck him. You've talked to him since then. I mean, like, oh, now I get it. And it was something about me and him that I don't remember what the case was. But, I mean, you turn around and you've fucking been talking to him. And I don't care. It is what it is. Bros are gonna fucking, you know. They fight and have their fucking issues. Guys do differently than a woman does. And girls do. Or women. You know what I mean? I'm like, I'm sitting out here. I need a fucking shower. You know. Where are you at? You're in Alexandria? 3M. I'm at 3M. I can't charge my phone. I've got my dog and all my shit. His mom said that she would help me. He won't fucking even call his mom. I mean, at this point, I'm so fucking pissed. Like, I'm pissed. Like, he's fucking like, no. It's like a jealousy thing. He's gotta be in control. You know, I don't fucking know. I need to go to the bathroom. He won't even, like, give me the keys all of a sudden. You know, now's the perfect time to play a fucking child. You know. I'm like, I literally have 1%. So, Gabby gets off work at 2. And then what? You guys are going back tomorrow? Get the boys and stuff? And the girls? Yeah. Oh. Hmm. Other than that, yeah. Yeah, I think Roaners probably will have what you need. It's for the Suburban, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at Roaners right now. I think I'm gonna give them a call. Yeah, they might even have it pulled. Although, I was thinking, like, Abco, they pull your parts. In Fridley, I know you're not really that far, but. Out that way, but. Do you remember Abco? Yeah, so far, they've got the best price that I've called around. And, um. Okay. Yeah, so far, they've got the best price. Okay. Yeah, he just fucking, like. I went. Dude, he fucking, like. It's fucked up. I, like, took the lid off of his coffee. Chucked it at him. A little bit of coffee, like, came with the lid. Like, kind of dripped out or fucking splashed out, dude. He tried fucking beating me up. Good job, Luke. You guys. This is crazy.

I was getting ready to go out and have a cigarette. Oh, that's good, that's good. Yeah, man, so how you been? Uh, doing well. Well, best as I can be. Doing well. Just got over being sick, so it's like, oh, I fucking suck, but yeah, every time it does, it sucks. Yeah, especially with getting older and shit. Yeah, I totally get that. But yeah, doing well overall. Just uh, actually, today's my birthday, and it's been a hell of a good morning. Oh, yeah? Well, happy birthday, and what is it, what's, what's happened so far? Like, bad stuff? It's just been like terrible so far? No, I was getting sick. I was the first time I got sick in like 18 months, and it was like, like sick, sick. Oh, it's a 24-hour cold or 24-hour flu. All right, get rid of that, but it's like, oh, this one lasts like a week. Yeah. Was it, was it like a COVID thing, or just? No, no, it was a severe cold that turned into pneumonia. Damn, dude, that is terrible. And it's like, all right, couldn't breathe, and all right, fought it all off, got, didn't realize I had a fever. All right, fought all that shit off. Finally, went to the doctor, and doctor goes, oh, well, here you go. Two days later, it's like, a-okay. It's like, oh, thank you, doctor. Yeah. Are you still, so are you still living down closer to the cities, or did you, you didn't move back up north, did you? No, no, I'm still in cities. I'm, two years ago, I was living in St. Paul, and I moved to downtown, and then now I'm over on, like, and then now I'm over on, like, Lowry, and right on the river. Oh, really? Really nice apartments? Oh, actually, we, we have the upper half of a house. Oh, okay. Oh, so you're like, okay, you're on the other side of Lowry. Yeah, we're, we can, we can see the park. We can't see the river, but there's a park, and then go across the park, there's a river. Yeah, yeah, I'm super familiar with that area, because Lagos Tacos used to be right there on, on Lindale. I know where you're talking about, because I keep seeing them all over the place. Yeah, yeah, dude, that was the 100%, like, no, all hands down, like, the best place in the world for tacos, and they, like, they shut, they closed the doors on that location recently, which sucks, because that was, like, an awesome place. Yeah, I've heard, I think they still got a food truck floating around. Yeah, yeah, they do got another location somewhere nearby. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've seen that. I'm pretty sure it's a red and yellow truck. Yeah, dude, yeah. Red truck with yellow lettering and all that. Yeah, if you have a chance, dude, eat their, eat their tacos, man. Best tacos. I don't know what they do differently, but it's, it's amazing. I'm gonna have to ask my sister if that's the truck that's at her gas station, and if it is, I'm gonna have to say no, because people keep getting sick out of that truck. Because, yeah, she's gotten sick multiple times eating her food. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But that, that's the truck that's there. I don't know if it's that truck or not. Yeah, yeah, I suppose I'd have to do a Google search or something like that. So, how's, how's the pickup street, you know, that thing still going hard? Which one? Oh, no. They all died. Really? What, what, what happened to it, to the last one? I thought that that pickup truck was kind of nice. Silverado? Yes, the Silverado, that was a, it ran great, and then the transmission started failing. I lost first, and I lost third. Yeah. Or no, I lost second, I lost fourth. But then I had first, second, or first, third, and fifth. And I don't know what, it just, it just wouldn't switch gears. And then a hole the size of a watermelon developed on the floor. So, I literally had a, a plate that went from the center console to the door, from beyond the pedals to under the seat, just to make sure my feet didn't go through. Oh, shit, that's crazy. Oh, I put the, I made sure the quarter inch or three-eighths of the, you know, it was a good heavy steel plate. So, it's like, nope, this will hold. Anything that bounces up, this thing's bulletproof. Yeah. Damn. Yeah, but I, uh, because you were actually, that, that truck had 400,000 miles on it. Oh, yeah. Did you end up drunk in it after that? Yeah, once the transmission went, I mean, the engine, you can start the engine, it was still dead quiet. Like, the engine still had another 500,000 probably on it. If you kept up on it, the engine's going to keep going, because that thing just, it didn't use any fluids. It ran great. It started every time. Yeah. Damn, dude, that's too bad that you got rid of that. You know, uh, you know, uh, fucking the, the 4L60E transmission is like the easiest transmission to replace. Oh, I would have, but the, I would have had to tell the cab, too. The cab would suck. Your, your, my phone, your phone broke up a minute. Oh. Yeah, the cab on that truck was shot. Oh, really? Yeah, because it's not like it, the cab wasn't getting ready to actually break off the frame. It was so bad. Yeah. But mechanically, if I could have switched off the transmission, that thing would have, I'd probably still be driving it. Yeah. Well, it's the same, same thing with the F-150 that, uh, I had the straight six in there. That thing ran like a dream. The transmission failed. I lost all gears. The only gear I had left was reversed. And it's like, I can, I might be able to still get that truck back. Yeah. So I'm, I'm, I'm doing a transmission in mine now. Like I, uh, I just, uh, I've got close to 300,000 miles on it. And, uh, my reverse went, uh, like probably six months ago. And then on Wednesday, um, my, yeah, like my torque converter went because like, I couldn't, I was like, just about to get on the highway. And then all of a sudden, um, I got kind of switched out of gear on me and I couldn't get it back into any gear. And then after doing some research, I found out that that's like, basically it was my torque converter that failed. And like, and also like when it was, uh, when I was on the side of the road and it was just idling, like I could hear, um, I got, there was like this weird fucking like kicking or clicking that was coming from like, you know, like the transmission. Yeah. Like right under the cab. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I, after doing some like research, yeah, they, I guess that's like the super common symptoms of a failed, failed torque converter. So I was gonna, I've done the 4L60E transmissions a couple of times now. And, uh, so I was just gonna, you know, take it down, replace the torque converter and put it back, put it all back together. And, and, uh, now that I've, I've got it all down and I'm like, I've got the torque converter, like I was looking inside of it and I could see like that there's a bunch of debris in there. So like, I guess it wasn't just the torque converter that got destroyed. So now yeah, it probably spread debris around and then that broke more debris. Yeah. And I mean, so I'm right now I'm looking at like, do I, do I tear it all down and like, you know, replace all the seals and all that shit and replace the broken parts? Or do I, you know, do I, if I can trade, like go out and fucking buy a used one. And, uh, it really depends on like, it depends on your knowledge. Do you know how to tear down a transmission? Cause I can replace them, but I have no knowledge on tearing them down. I've seen it done, but to me it was a wonder, like, Whoa. Yeah. It was a mass mechanic and I'm a beginning. At the time I was new. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've been doing, uh, transmissions, engine swaps. Like I've done probably, uh, probably seven, seven of one and eight of the other all within the last two years. Uh, cause it's like kind of what I've been doing is like a mobile mechanic thing, like just for side money. But I, I'm like right now I am working doing like my primary job is, uh, I'm basically like a life coach for people with substance abuse issues. Good. Yeah. Working with some, uh, you know, recovery community organization, they call it an RCO. Right. I understand myself. I can honestly benefit from that type of thing. And at the same time, I do know mechanics, but I can do most right now. I'm kind of primarily looking for like, uh, a transmission, like, like, uh, looking on like Facebook marketplace. I'm, I'm like, look, I've called around to different places and I, um, Abco and Fridley, like so far has given me like the best price for like a used one. They want like, I like Abco. Yeah. I don't know. It's already like cold and everything and 30 day warranty. Um, yeah, there's like 350 bucks and I might, like, plus a core and I have like my transmission in my trunk right now. Like today's my day. I'm supposed to try to go get, get like a new one or abuse one or wherever I can find it so I can get back and put that shit back together. But it, that's a bummer that you got rid of the, the Silverado. If you could get it back, man, I'll help you put it in. No, that truck was already sold to somebody else. I seen that truck going down the road after they switched it out and it's like fuckers. Yeah. The cab was shot. The suspension was almost done. So whoever bought it there, I mean, they got a good deal. Yeah. It is a good deal. Yeah. It is a good deal. Cause like that's a common, common issue with those Chevys is like the transmission goes out and usually it's like, you know, they lose reverse or in your case, you know, they lose second and third and like, it's so easy to like, look it up on the internet to see like what the part, what those parts are that are common. Yeah. I tried switching out the solenoids and everything. No, it didn't work. Yeah. I can't, I haven't done one that does the second and third and like, but I have heard of that happening. That's super common. I haven't looked up what, what it was, but I know that if you, if you lose their reverse, then you, it's almost always your son shell gear. Yeah. I lost a main gears reverse work. Great. Cause then, uh, the one truck I missed is my F one fifties cause that was a manual, but also I upgraded the rear suspension to a three quarter ton. It was a half ton. Oh man. I had the inline eight. I had the VA transmission and the inline six, uh, engine brick and transmit the, uh, transmission failed on me. I had a bump and pop the hole inside. It popped a hole in the side of your transmission. Uh, I'm guessing I hit a log. So I was always going off road. It was too old drive, but it was posi track so I can go everywhere. Okay. Okay. Wow. That's crazy. I've never heard of that happening before. Oh yeah. I cracked it and then it leaked out and then lost the gears and it's like, um, shit. Wow. That's super bad-ass. That's like, I paid like $300 for the truck. Yeah. Well, maybe a four. So no vehicle right now? No, right now I got a Impala or a couple of Impalas, but I'm going to one I just bought. It's got transmission issues. So I'm gonna take parts from that one. Cause, uh, the one that's parked, I got the, uh, rack and pinions out. So I'm gonna take the rack and pinion off the other one, put it on the one, uh, and then I'm gonna take the one since they're 2004, 2006, they're the same racks. And then I'm gonna take the tires, put them all on the other one and whatever other parts, uh, junk the new one and keep the old one. Cause the old one runs way better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We just got ripped. We just got rid of, uh, a nine, a 2007 Chevy Impala. It was like a white one. And we had the same thing with the rack and pinion. I had to replace that. That's a pain in the ass, but thankfully it's not too difficult. Yeah. Yeah. I got it done. I, uh, once I got one of those impacts, it was nice. Yeah. I can, uh, I got an old floor and an old six and you can't reach either one with impact. It's wrench all the way. Yeah. Yeah. It's out there with angles and all that. No, it didn't work. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah. That's what I, because we kept on having issues with it. You know, the crazy thing is, is so I, I redid the rack and pinion just before it was sold. And, and then, uh, I, I'm still friends with the people that I sold it to. And I guess they, they had to do it again. Oh, geez. Yeah. Which is weird. I don't even know how the fuck that happens. Like having to do it twice. Cause it's not like we did it wrong or anything. Well, I know this one went out and it's like, all right. I thought it was a line. I thought, and then the pump went out. I replaced the pump and I replaced all the lines and the rack is still leaking heavily. So it's like, fuck. So I know it's, it's the rack itself. And, uh, the new car audit and all suspension snapped right away in the back and it needs brakes and a few other things. The car runs great. So I'm thinking I'm going to take the same time. The transmission is slipping hard. So it's like, uh, and it's a different motor, but the, everything else is the same. So I'm going to take the rack, um, all the battery. Where do you have all these, you keep all these vehicles like right on the street, like where you're at. The car I'm currently driving is on the street. The car I got parked is mom's and that's in my parking spot. Okay. So I'm going to switch those parts around, do the tires, rack, the battery and mom's car will be a okay. And then call the junkyard and go, Hey, come get this car. Transmission's done. Uh, maybe it can power out the motor. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a three, five or a three, nine or some other number. It's not the three over the three, eight. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that car didn't come with a police package option, but same with the other. Oh, okay. The interceptor. Yeah. The interceptor. Yeah. But they, they didn't, uh, neither one of them have it, but there isn't option for those years to actually have it. But no, these are the base models. Mom's car is actually the mid model. Yeah. But my base model, almost all the parts of match up with mom. So it's like, Oh, Oh, here's brand new tires. And while here's a rack and pinion, here's a battery, um, new brake pads. Yeah. That just did the brakes and all that on this car. I just bought. Do I love doing brakes and rotors? It's like one of those things that are easy to do, but it's like quick, easily, easy gratification. Cause like it's rewarding. Yeah. So nice and easy. And I was like, boom, boom, boom. Okay. Oh, you got a broken brake line. All right. Let me run a new line real fast and do, do, do. Oh, there's another a hundred bucks. Easy. Yeah. Yeah. I totally fucking found out that, uh, like basically if you go and hang out at one of the auto zones and, uh, at like in like St. Paul or the auto zone on like Broadway, I don't know. Those are the only two ones I've been to for sure that are for sure like this. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, that are for sure like this. But if you just hang out there and you either pop your hood or you like open your trunk and just hang out, you, people will come up to you and they're like, Hey, can you help me with this? And it's like, and it's like, it's crazy. I made, I made $450, close to $500 just like from hanging out there for a couple hours. I'm going to have to try that. Holy shit. Yeah. I'm telling you that it's like 100% worth it. And then like after, I mean, just after hanging out there one or two days, I, I mean, just from the people that you did help, like now you got like people calling you back all the time and like, cause they love your work and it's cool. That's nice. That's awesome. I'd never thought of that. That is, I am definitely have to try that. Yeah. You said, you said you live at, oh fuck. Yeah, that's right. You live off of Lindale. No, right now I'm off of a Lowry and Marshall. I'm on the east side of the river. Okay. Lindale's on the west side. I do. I get Lindale and Lowry mixed up all the time. Yeah, I'm northeast. I'm not north. And Marshall. What's the, what's your street address? Uh, 2755 Marshall. Marshall street northeast. Yeah. Yeah, man. I'm at, oh dude, I was fucking way off. And I was so, so off. Yeah. I'm like, if I go walking, I can be downtown in 45 minutes. If I go on a bike, I could be down there at 10. If I drive, I can be down there at five. Yeah. Oh dude, I'm like, I'm like in your area. Cause I work in this, in Minneapolis, usually Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. And then, and then like Thursday, Friday, I, I work out in, uh, St. Cloud. I'm up to that area. I'm up to that area. Yeah. I haven't been out there in a bit. Yeah. I, I've never really, uh, never really like hung out much at St. Cloud. I mean, when I did, I have hung out there, but, uh, I've never really been to like any recovery meetings out there. So, I mean, I guess that does kind of give me a little bit of a handicap. I'm sure there's a bunch out there though. Yeah. There's a huge, huge, huge recovery community out there. Yeah. That's something I would want to go to more. I need to get tomorrow. I haven't been to a meeting in quite a while. I need to get back to it. Knuckle down. Yeah. Have you, have you had any issues drinking lately or what? Yeah, I have been drinking. I've been cutting back and then today it's like, all right, I'll go have a shot. And I'm definitely feeling the shot and it's like, yeah, but I've only had the one shot. Is it just you that you stay with or who else do you got living in a couple of rooms? Me, I've got my, uh, I don't know, sister-in-law, brother, sister, then nephew. There's a couple of us here. Okay. You don't mean Sarah and, uh, Josh? No. No. Sarah is my sister. Right. So, you said an in-law? Well, Andy's, uh, Bobby Joe. It's Andy's sister. Oh, okay. Yeah. I know Bobby Joe. She's an in-law? I thought she was like a, like a sister, a half-sister. Yeah, that's what I consider her, but sister, half-sister, and she's still a sister. One way or another, she's still a sister. Oh, I thought you called her sister-in-law at first. I, no, I don't know what to call her. I got you. But, uh, in one way or another, she's still a family. Yeah. Hey, you guys have been, like, like around each other for, since you guys were little kids? Well, no, I've met Bobby Joe when we were older. Oh, really? Yeah. That's crazy. First time we moved in together and actually started hanging out was on, uh, on the lift off of a university. Oh, yeah? University, that's right by, uh, that gas station, that green gas station, yeah? Yep, she still works there, and we still live next to that damn thing. Yeah. Look, I remember kids that, uh, walked up there to get a can of pop and some chips, walked in, and all of a sudden, there's a shootout in the parking lot, and I'm hiding, all I got to hide behind is a big thing of chips, and just like, oh, fuck, I'm gonna get the chips, and just like, oh, fuck, all I can do is hide my body and hope they don't see me. Fuck, chips ain't gonna be nothing. Yeah, I'm fucking hiding behind a bag of chips. Well, there was nothing to hide behind. Yeah. So, we just went all the way to the back of the store as far as we could, and well, here we go, and I didn't stop, and it's like, hey, I had some chick behind me, and she was pissing her pants, and it's like, all right, I'm gonna go look, and nope, I don't see nobody, looks clear, I'm getting the fuck out of here. 15 minutes later, the police show up. 15 minutes? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I, uh, that's why, I don't know, one of the reasons why I love, you know, the Twin Cities is because it is like the Wild West sometimes. Well, Twin Cities is pretty wild, but at the same time, it's like, if you get in trouble, don't expect help fast. Yeah. Well, you know, actually, the other day, there was an incident, uh, where my truck got vandalized, uh, while I was working on it in, uh, in, uh, St. Paul Auto Zone, but that's kind of like a big, long-ass story, and to tell you the truth, it's fucking a little embarrassing. But, uh, yeah, basically, some chick with mental, some mental health issues, uh, got bit by a dog that, like, my, that, uh, I was with, like, it's not my dog, but, yeah, she was warned not to come near by, near, and, uh, she ended up doing it anyways, and got bit. I wasn't, like, watching her, but then I, like, helped her out and gave her some, like, medical attention. I had, like, rubber gloves on and shit like that, and so I helped her out, and I was like, okay, like, you should be good. Make sure you go to, you know, see a professional and, like, 12 hours or less, otherwise that could get infected and you're going to be in a lot of pain, and I was, like, kind of trying to, like, respectfully kind of shoo her away, and she started getting all lippy with me, and I was like, listen, you got to get out of my truck or I'm calling an ambulance and they're going to work with you, and so that's what I ended up coming to, and they got her out of my truck, and then she, like, I'm not going with you guys, and they left, and, uh, and then, uh, as soon as she was out of the truck, I locked the doors, and me and my buddy started, like, walking to go get breakfast, and I still had all my tools, like, laying out on the ground, and I seen her walking back all slowly with her shopping cart. Oh, geez. Yeah, it was, she was, like, a she was, like, a homeless person that basically just, like, you know, she was trying to take advantage of the situation. Yeah, definitely, but, yeah, when I got about 60, 70 feet away from the truck, and seeing that she was, you know, creeping back with her little shopping cart, and then, uh, uh, she's like, you got my blue backpack in your truck, and I was, like, uh, you know, I didn't want her to think I was going to, I was trying to steal from her, and I, so I, like, started walking back, and she, like, grabbed up the biggest wrench she could find of mine, and started going crazy on my truck. That's what you just call the cops, and be like, no, you're under arrest. Yeah, that's what I did, like, uh, the cop, and the cops were actually there. That's what made me think of this whole story. The cops were actually there in, like, probably two, less than two minutes. Yeah, it was actually kind of funny, like, the last part, uh, was, uh, you know, because the cop came and, like, got my statement, and got my ID, and, um, and then, you know, he gave me his card, and as soon as he gave me his card, he's like, oh, I guess she's fighting with him, and he, like, took off the full sprint, like, the opposite direction, and I don't know why that was, but that was just, like, so, I mean, it was such a spectacle. Stuff out of a live PD, right? Yeah, I know. I was like, well, and he fucking takes off, and it was, yeah, it took nine cop cars, two ambulances, and one fire truck to fucking, like. Holy shit, they really called out to Calvary. Yeah, dude, I don't know, like, I, because I, like, went across the street to get my breakfast, and I could see, like, where they had, like, stopped her, but I couldn't, like, see, like, the action, so I don't know what the fuck was going on, but, yeah, it was, like, a lot. There's a lot going on there. Yeah. You ran across the one super crazy person. Yeah, I mean, I could have gone all gangster and shit, but, I mean, I feel like there's a time for that, but I think, in this case, because of, like, the mental health aspect. It's easier to step back and go, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't want nothing to do with this. Right, right, like, I don't think any, I don't think you'd think I was cool if I, like, curb stomped this chick for doing what she did. I mean, it would have been some dude or some kid that was, like, my size, you know, hell yeah, why not, why not, I'll fucking, I'd love to throw down, but not in this case, this poor lady. Yeah, I agree with that one, like, there's a time and a place, but if you feel it or something's, oh, no, it's better to go, hey, wait, just step back and let the good guys do their thing. Yeah, yeah, well, maybe we should, when I come back, when I get my transmissions fixed, I come back in town this coming week, I'll come by and we can try to get one or two of your cars going. I'm not gonna charge you for anything, of course, and then, like, we, and then you could, because what, you're not doing anything for work full-time? I can't, I feel like I already asked that, but I can't remember what you said. No, right now I'm still a PCA full-time. Okay. So, I need to get out to Andover, and that's what I'm using the car I bought for, that's why I'm driving back and forth, but I do need to, I need to figure it out with that, and yeah, I need to make, I need to call Charlie and identify, make sure I got the same parts in this car as what's in this car for the rack and pinion, and as long as the rack and pinion's good, then everything else is a-okay, because it's the same, same bolt pattern and everything, and that car's got brand new tires. Almost. Charlie, Charlie's the owner of the car that you're taking the parts from? No, I got, I own the cars. Okay. I need to, I need to contact my cousin because he, uh, he's a, he specializes in auto parts, and he'll be able to tell me if it's the same exact part. So, I'll have to take pictures of certain codes and all that in the car, like, uh, those, uh, a plate with a shit ton of numbers on it, it'll have like 16 or 20 sets of numbers, and I gotta take a picture of that on both cars. I don't want any gloves on. Along with VINs and, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. As far as I understand, I believe that transmission was used in all of them, or that, all of them, or that, uh, not transmission, but, uh, rack and pinion was used in both cars. Yeah, what, but they're, they're like four years apart, three years apart, is that what you said? Well, I got a 2004 Chevy Impala and a 2006 Chevy Impala, but the 2004 has got the 3.0 or the 3.8, and then it's got the police package, versus a 2006 has a 3.1, a 3.5, a 3.9, and then the police package. I'm pretty sure the rack and pinion on the two cars, because of the 3.5 on the one and the 3.8 on the other, pretty sure the rack and pinions are the same. Um, uh, so the 2006 is a three eight and then no 2004 is a three eight. The 2006 is the three five. Okay. I had that backwards then. Okay. Okay. I'm going to put you on mute for a quick second. I got to use the restroom. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Okay, says that they're not fully compatible. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so I got it. I got an explanation as to why they're not compatible. But it following that it says the recommendation is to verify the RPO codes like you were saying for steering gear and suspension package on the service parts identification sticker. And that will typically. I'm back. Yeah, so I have an explanation as to why they're not interchangeable actually. Yeah, they're not. I'll text this to guessing a flight link slightly different frame size. Yeah, the 2006 to 2013 wide body vehicle revised. And also the police interceptor has different components and turn. No, we got base models. There's no police interceptors. 2003 with a police interceptor. All right. Didn't you say that. No, it's an old for over the three regular. And then, you know, six with a 3.5. Okay. All right. So I do got to 2004 3.8 2006 3.5. And I'll tell it that it's not. No, that's right. But it's not you're saying it's not it. Neither of those are interceptor though. No. No, there's regular base models. Although everything was riding good. Those fucking things you hit the gas you're in the seat. Say that last part again. Oh, I know. Either car. If it's driving good. You hit the gas you're in the seat. Yeah, they fucking. Yeah, the acceleration. I time the old six, which is gears you're already at 60. Yeah, I wouldn't know I suppose I really don't drive like that anymore. I drive like I'm either like I drive. I drive slow but if I have to hit the gas and get somewhere and get up and going. All right, but then I get up to speed and cruise. So still says that. So you don't have any. Yeah. I wish. Yeah. I wish I still had the pickups. What about your mom has this friend I can't remember what his fucking name is though. He lives like kind of up north towards like Pine City, or like past about Pine City. And he had like two avalanches. Do you know who I'm talking about. That could be any number of people on top of my head. Yeah. I'm city. Yeah, it's like up 35. I'm saying he's up east of the last right. Correct. Yeah. All right. The center is one of 371 way the fuck up there, North of Pequot over by Camp Ripley. I always confuse those two. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know you're talking. I did some digging out there for mining. Yeah. You mean like aggregating aggregation. No, we're doing surface mining. We're making classifier class one class class one to class seven, depending on our what's being used for is under homes under pavement under driveways customer class. Special utilities. We go up there and start digging up the ground and I'd have to read the ground and okay this is where I'm digging and control it. Every hour I'm doing tests. Make sure I got the clay content, silicon content, rock content, small, medium, large. Everything left stay within specs. And if it's not, I'd have to read the ground or you dig here, not here. And do it again and make sure everything stayed so we got paid by the county or the state or the city or the farmer. We didn't like it. He gave my boss hell. I caught hell. Everybody else downhill caught hell but I was always at the bottom of the show. That same time I was the one leading the show. Yeah. All right, where we set up. Okay, you put this here you put this here is the angles we're doing. As we're moving. This is how it's going to move. Okay, this is where the pile is going to be and make sure okay there's enough area for so many 30,000 tons 50,000 tons. And then be like those great big dirt piles you'd see in the fields. Yeah, those piles up. Yeah, that was called aggregation aggregating. No, it's surface mining. Okay. Yeah, that was my job. I'd make sure the plants were all set up and get them all ready for transport transport break them down set them up. Run the loader. Do the whole yard. Same time I'm all right, here's the new guy. I'm gonna train you. You don't go here you don't do this you do this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew a guy that did that for a long time. And then, but he just passed away. He passed away like two years ago. I did it for like five six years, I got tired of being the fucking boss and oh hey, the new guy let slip when he was getting paid and it's like, dude, you're getting paid a dollar less than I am. Fuck you. I quit. Yeah. I went to school and I started going for welding. And now it's like, Oh, you want me back. Now you're gonna be paying me $30 an hour at least because all the shit I know. Hey, can I give you a call right back my sister keeps on calling me over and over and over again. Yeah, no worries. I'll call you back. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hey, what's up. How's it going. What's up. I'm parked right now. Yeah, I know. I'm parked right now. I was just on the phone with somebody. Okay, where are you. Painesville. You're still in Painesville. Yeah, yeah. I'm only Gabby gets off work in a couple hours. She's working here. And my main objective is to get a transmission. Okay. Yeah. And then I got to be back here to pick up Gabby at a certain time. Yeah. Okay. Well, sorry. I my freaking I just realized this. This plugin isn't working in a cigarette cigarette later. Oh, thanks. Thank you. So you're parked. Wait to wait to talk to her. Get Gabby or meet up with her. She's working in Painesville. Yeah. Just for the day. She's working in Painesville. But yeah, I was just talking to some another mechanic who like who you had a bunch of different call runners. Runners. Huh? Runners. Runners. You're looking for transmission. Yeah. Call runners. It's not yet. Pull yourself or do it yourself. But there's runners Christie's and Windy Hill. Yeah, I've talked to Windy Hill. They don't have anything available for me. Runners is huge. Runners is nice. It's all, you know, I need a bunch of junk out there. Like, you know, Windy Hill has been there for a fucking like 70 years. He's just keeping shit around. I mean, yeah, he's just keeping us and ends around for, you know, locals or whatever. Just a little bit here and there. Like he he stopped getting, you know, vehicles out there at that yard a long time ago. And then also there's another one on Highway 71. They sell. They in Wilmer. Yeah, they buy and fix and sell. But they've also got like a where they'll let you go if they've got like odds and ends or they know what they got in their salvage yard. But, you know, they fix things up to sell them. So, you know, they also do sell parts. And I don't know about that place. And I think that place in Alec, too, but I don't know her and Carlos. That fucking other one. I don't know if they opened back up. I know they closed down. I don't know if they're open back up or not. If somebody bought that place and reopened it, it might. So you're going to have to maybe look at the GPS. But those are what's out that way. As far as I know. Shit for brains, I'll tell you more. Home, gonna know I'm talking about Lucas Strand. Oh, I don't talk to him. Yeah, you fucking liar. I'm like, don't fucking bullshit me, Brandon. You and him, you and Lazy Bull talk to him. And I really don't give a fuck. But whatever. Except for I don't talk to him. Why are you lying? Why did you just say that? Like you have a point to prove. The last time you fucking talked to me, I was, you told me not to call him. And I was like, why? And then you told me that shit that he doesn't, basically that he doesn't like me. And he's a fucking two-faced punk. So, fuck him. You've talked to him since then. I mean, like, oh, now I get it. And it was something about me and him that I don't remember what the case was. But, I mean, you turn around and you've fucking been talking to him. And I don't care. It is what it is. Bros are gonna fucking, you know. They fight and have their fucking issues. Guys do differently than a woman does. And girls do. Or women. You know what I mean? I'm like, I'm sitting out here. I need a fucking shower. You know. Where are you at? You're in Alexandria? 3M. I'm at 3M. I can't charge my phone. I've got my dog and all my shit. His mom said that she would help me. He won't fucking even call his mom. I mean, at this point, I'm so fucking pissed. Like, I'm pissed. Like, he's fucking like, no. It's like a jealousy thing. He's gotta be in control. You know, I don't fucking know. I need to go to the bathroom. He won't even, like, give me the keys all of a sudden. You know, now's the perfect time to play a fucking child. You know. I'm like, I literally have 1%. So, Gabby gets off work at 2. And then what? You guys are going back tomorrow? Get the boys and stuff? And the girls? Yeah. Oh. Hmm. Other than that, yeah. Yeah, I think Roaners probably will have what you need. It's for the Suburban, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at Roaners right now. I think I'm gonna give them a call. Yeah, they might even have it pulled. Although, I was thinking, like, Abco, they pull your parts. In Fridley, I know you're not really that far, but. Out that way, but. Do you remember Abco? Yeah, so far, they've got the best price that I've called around. And, um. Okay. Yeah, so far, they've got the best price. Okay. Yeah, he just fucking, like. I went. Dude, he fucking, like. It's fucked up. I, like, took the lid off of his coffee. Chucked it at him.

And are you looking for used or re-manned? Used. I mean, I'll probably ask you the cost of both, so... Okay, yeah. In regards to re-man, the cheaper of the two options that I show, you'd be at $2,075 with round-trip freight. You say round-trip freight? Oh, like it's not at your store right now? Correct, yeah. We're just a distributor. It's a manufacturer down in Texas. It can be shipped to me, and you can pick it up, or we can ship to a business address of your liking. Looks like there's an additional 6.4, and it looks like they are available, so I'd say three to five businesses to your door. All right, and used. And so you're saying that the APS that's located in... What does that say? In Rockville? Okay, and you don't have parts, actually? Well, you are the distributor, so you do have parts there, correct? Yeah, so we're a salvage yard. We got some used options here, but in regards to re-man, we get those distributed straight from the manufacturer. I gotcha, I gotcha. All right, so what's the cost looking for just the used? For a used, is there a certain mileage you're looking to stay around or under? I'm open to... Well, it kind of depends on your warranty. Okay. So, yeah, I'm open to hear a variety of what you got. Yeah, I mean, I look for something around 175,000 miles, or is that too high, or? No preference, really, I guess. Yeah, it's not too high. Okay, so let's go with this one as a benchmark, 175K. We got a couple different warranty options when it comes to used. You know, standard no added charge is a 90-day parts-only type of warranty. Okay. And if you want to do like a one-year or three-year, we have those options, you can do parts-only or parts-and-viper. Yeah, I would do the parts-only, because it's going to be made doing the install. You're going to do the install. And what is it, like an extra $100 to make it like a year or three or something? All based on percentages. If you can pick this one up, if you can pick this one up, the standard warranty, you're at $1,175. Okay, what if it was, and that's the standard warranty, so basically just near 90-day warranty. Yep, and then like a one-year, you're at $1,350. Okay, what's a transmission that has the highest miles with just your standard 90-day? Cheapest option. Yeah, the cheapest option available. And I do have the core with me. Okay, looks like my cheapest option is going to be one with 197,000 miles on it. I did get it brought in from Wyoming, so typically a week, week and a half. I'm sorry, hold on a second, I'm hearing you. Let me change it to... All right, say it again. Yeah, so an option with 197,000 on Wyoming, which is my cheapest that I've seen, it would be $1,150, so not much different from that $1,175.

I'll make sure to put that in gas, uh, which will certainly make you so you're good to, and from work tomorrow, whether this thing with my, my gas card is like a bust or not. Uh, what, what time do you work tomorrow? It's the same time I always go to work. It's not never always the same. What time can you? 10. I have to be at work at 10, but your car's not really. Yeah. So hopefully I'll be at work at 10. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have to be at work at 10, but your car's not really yeah. So hopefully I'm just going to be running late to work because I have to take the kids to daycare and school, but I have to leave right after I dropped them off and go straight to work. Where, where are you working? I just said pink though. Okay, um, what time do you get off work? At four, or like a little earlier because I have to come and pick them up. Um, so I need to get, um, I need to get, I need to get a new tranny tomorrow and, uh, three of the places that I've seen are all along 23. Okay. Um, that and, uh, what else? Um, you said something about, uh, like tomorrow you're gonna go get Zach and bring him back to the cities? Um, I said that the other night. Oh, about tonight? What? I said that about like yesterday night. Yeah, about tonight, right? No, like yesterday night. I said that like I would do it yesterday night. Oh, yesterday you said you were going to do it the same day, but not the next day. I thought you said you were going to do it, but like the next day, but then the next day came and we never did it and that was kind of just yesterday, right? Right. All right, well, so I was talking with somebody else about Zach and, uh, like these sober homes that are out here in St. Cloud that are available. Uh, the, the owner of these sober homes, uh, just got approved, uh, like a couple of his properties just got GRH approved, which means that, uh, Zach could basically, uh, start staying in them. Uh, if all, as long as he, uh, had his, like I had his worker, uh, put in for, put him on for GRH funding and, and then after once that was on there, he would need, uh, a letter of recommendation, uh, for housing, which could come from either me or, uh, that same case worker, and then he would be able to start staying at the sober home. Okay. There are a lot of sober homes, but any, any, any GRH funded, uh, property, you'd be able to stay at. Um, but isn't there like limitations to that? Like he actually has to be sober. I don't know. That's a good question. I feel like, uh, there, I know that that's definitely a thing in certain places. I don't know if that's like, uh, a little bit different than others. I haven't had a chance to ask that question yet. I feel like it's in the, it's in the name, like, I mean, GRH funding doesn't actually imply recovery or related. So then it's not a sober, a sober home. It's like a halfway home. Yeah. Uh, a halfway home, sober home. Isn't that, I don't know. I was kind of thought they were the same thing. Or like group home, like a group home for fucking. Uh, hello. Hello. Right. Yeah. Is that my fucking, are you using my Bluetooth? Yeah. Damn. That does suck. Is this your first time hearing it? Huh? Is this your first time hearing it? Yeah. Like, I mean, it doesn't suck. You just sound far away. Uh, well, where's the microphone in this thing? How about now? Do I seem louder now? A little bit, but it also sounds like you're shouting. Oh, okay. Well, I don't know where the microphone is. So when do you think you're going to be done? I don't know. I don't know how much stuff is there. And like, they just like, like physically need you to move stuff or like. Yeah. I believe it's like, uh, she said that she was on her way to, uh, her, I don't know, this place and that she, it's on the corner, right? Said that if she was on her way to her friend's place, uh, she had to like move from like one place to another because, uh, her boyfriend or something like that had found out where she was staying and had to like, uh, like leave because it's like something to do with a domestic violence situation. And it's just like in town? Yeah, it's, uh, literally, uh, so the same person that owns the sober home I was just at owns, also owns this one. What's up? What? Nothing. I already, I had some cough medicine. I gave him some when you told me to give him some. You got some for the trip and it's in the blue bag, but thank you. I need to turn the heater on. It's cold. Oh, what? I'm turning the heater up. It's cold. Yeah, it'll be warmer in here. All right, Mom, I'm almost about to pull up, so let me give you a call. All right.

Luckily he didn't fucking hit my window, that would have fucking hit all over me. Wow. How? Like, you were like driving through a neighborhood? Yeah, well, yeah, I'm driving, you know, like through the sticks, like I'm driving through on a fucking road, like a back, not a, yeah, like a back road, whatever, like through some houses and stuff and he just weed whacked it, like that's the only fucking thing that could make sense because like, I didn't fucking, I'm on a, I'm not on a dirt road or anything and he's weed whacking and I fucking flipped back around and I was like, did you see that? And he was like, did I do that? He's old and I felt bad, like I wasn't trying to yell at him or anything, but I took his number down and I was like, I'll call my insurance agent and like, I have full coverage and stuff, but like, if I could just get your number just in case and he's like, okay, I'm so sorry. And I was like, I would just be careful before you do that against someone else, like fucking scared the fucking, like, it felt like someone just shot my window. Like, I felt like I just had to drive by, be done. Yeah. Yeah. And now like my fucking thing is all shattered. We have to pick up the kids in the car and I have like glass all over the fucking baby seat basically. Um, I'll, uh. And now it's like falling, like it's shattered.

Right. Yeah. I remember the shop vac. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it's just now I got a fucking, like I'm, my car is vandalized too now. Yeah. Fucking. And it's cold outside and I fucking, now I gotta be driving with the fucking cold. I'm going to need like plastic wrap for my car. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah.

Um, I'll be there in 23 minutes and I don't know if you want to send a message to the daycare and say we might be running a little late that and let them know what just fucking happened basically. Okay. Um, and then, yeah, I'm going to call my insurance agent and see like what he fucking, like if I could just get a fucking, what, what happens now? Well, what do you mean?

Let me call him and fucking see if I need to fucking get that or if he can get it for me. I don't know. You call the guy, the guy you mean? Well, I mean, he's fine. He's probably still fucking outside working and stuff. I would text that guy and just tell him his insurance information.

When you get here, I'll have a shop vac ready to vacuum the glass out because it's a high powered vacuum that he's got here. Right. Yeah. I remember the shop vac. Yeah. Because it's just now I got a fucking like my car is vandalized too now. Yeah. Fucking. And it's cold outside. And I fucking now I got to be driving with the fucking cold. I'm going to need like plastic wrap for my car. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I'm going to be there. And it says 23 minutes. I'll be there in 23 minutes. And I don't know if you want to send a message to the daycare and say we might be running a little late that and let them know what just fucking happened basically. OK. And then, yeah, I'm going to call my insurance agent and see like what he fucking like if I could just get a fucking what what happens now. Well, what do you mean? Like, is my insurance going to cover it? Like, do I have to fucking press charges on this guy's insurance? Like not pressure. You know what I mean? Yeah. If I'm not, I want to pay out of pocket for this. Yeah. I mean, in this case, you. So you you got that guy's name, right? I took it. You said what? I took his number. I have his name and his number. He didn't give you his insurance card. No, I. I was fucking scared and I fucking wanted to keep driving. I just wanted to fucking get his number and like some information from him. But like, I'm sure if I call him later and get his insurance, I don't know. Right. Yeah, that's the you need his insurance information or at least to give that name to his name and number to your insurance agent to pursue that, because if you just call your insurance agent and be like, I need to get the I need to start a claim. And you don't have that other person's information. They're going to use your own insurance. And that is going to, I mean, it'll cover it. But like, I mean, you're gonna have to pay a deductible and all that shit. Well, OK, well, let me yeah, let me call him and see if I need to get that or if he can get it for me. I don't know. Call a guy like the guy you mean. Well, I mean, he's he's probably still fucking outside working and stuff. I would text that guy and just tell him what you're going to need his insurance information that way. When you talk to your insurance agent, you'll already have a. Trust me. OK, well, I can't call him and see what he fucking says. Who are the insurance agent? Yeah. What? Why? Why would you do things backwards? Honestly, honestly, going if you want to get something going like right away, just call the call the glass guy and he'll do he'll call the insurance company for you. All the glass guy, he'll call the insurance for me. Yeah. Yeah. If you call the insurance, the glass guy, he'll call the insurance company for you. If you call the insurance, the glass guy, he'll take care of it. It'll be the only person you got to call. OK, you said 20. I don't remember his number. Actually, I might have it in my messages. What? You said you'll be here in 20 minutes. Yeah, I'll be there in 19 minutes. Oh, yeah. Well, I also have to put this transmission in the back of your trunk. What? Yeah. Oh, my God. You have stuff in there. Yeah, I mean, I have groceries in my green box. All right, well, groceries can go on the floor, I guess, in the backseat. But my box isn't going to fit anywhere other than on your lap. I mean, there will still be room in your in there. The transmission isn't as probably as big as you think. Oh, OK. But I will need help lifting it up into there. What the hell? What? I don't want to fucking touch your transmission. I'll give you gloves, but I'm not going to lift it up myself. All right. All right. All right. I got to get ready. All right, get ready. Yeah, I'll be there in 18 minutes. 18 minutes. All right. When you get here, if you could back in, that'd be great. OK. I'll try to.

Fucking scared the Jesus Christ out of me. He shot it off? No, like not actually, he was like doing one of those weed whackers, I'm driving down this fucking road and fucking, he's like weed whacking the side of his fucking thing or something and I don't know if he shot up a rock right when I fucking just drove by, but he fucking blew out my fucking driver's side back window. Luckily he didn't fucking hit my window, that would have fucking hit all over me. Wow. How? Like, you're like driving through a neighborhood? Yeah, well, yeah, I'm driving, you know, like through the sticks, like I'm driving through on a fucking road, like a back, not a, yeah, like a back road, whatever, like through some houses and stuff and he just weed whacked it, like that's the only fucking thing that could make sense because like, I didn't fucking, I'm on a, I'm not on a dirt road or anything and he's weed whacking and I fucking flipped back around and I was like, did you see that? And he was like, did I do that? He's old and I felt bad, like I wasn't trying to yell at him or anything, but I took his number down and I was like, I'll call my insurance agent and like, I have full coverage and stuff, but like, if I could just get your number just in case and he's like, okay, I'm so sorry. And I was like, I would just be careful before you do that against someone else, like fucking scared the fucking, like, it felt like someone just shot my window. Like, I felt like I just had to drive by, be done. Yeah. Yeah. And now like my fucking thing is all shattered. We have to pick up the kids in the car and I have like glass all over the fucking baby seat basically. And now it's like falling, like it's shattered. Like, I don't know if I should pull over and like kick it out anyways. Calm down. Calm down. When you get here, I'll, I'll have a shop vacuum ready so I can vacuum up your glass. When you get here, I'll have a shop vac ready to vacuum the glass out because it's a vacuum that he's got here. Right. Yeah, I remember the shop vac. If you could, please. Yeah.

Yeah. I mean it's pretty pretty cool. It's fulfilling Super rewarding. Do you have any free time? Um, yeah, yeah pretty demanding I mean it is uh, it is kind of I don't know to tell you the truth. It's the lowest It's really I really I like doing it a lot, but it's the lowest paying job i've ever had in my life But it's the lowest paying job i've ever had in my life Damn, so i've been uh, I want I want to ask you a question what I know I can't pay you buku money I know you would love to charge that but want to help me do some siding on my house. I gotta pay you Um, like seriously the whole house in the garage the whole house Whole garage I need to do the roots too But are you yeah, that would be more like a you thing than anything on the roof homie do you guys have a uh insurance like home insurance Um, i've got everything covered money-wise I mean because the thing with the roof like and siding I mean you you get like if you have insurance I could get you an approval and That way like all that's been handled I'm saying all that's been handled. So i'm trying to determine if I want to try to tackle it myself and save some money or Let the vultures have it because that's what it's going to happen Oh, so you already you already processed the claim on both of those things. Yeah, i'm done with yeah I'm done with everything. All I do is just figure out what I want to do Um So if it's going to save me some money and we actually have some left over that would be great Here's what we're trying to do. We're trying to do the roofs on the house. We're trying to do siding on the house We're trying to cut down a tree at the other house in blaine. We're trying to also build two decks Okay, uh, this is everything we're trying to do And as you know, we got a set amount of money from the insurance company But there's a lot that we want and we want to install a shower Or bathtub and walls in the in the blaine house as well. So those those are the things we're trying to get accomplished I see I would uh, if I was it would be great if we could make all this happen within this money, that'd be awesome But dealing with big companies, you know, they obviously don't go that route. But Yeah, I am in power of everything and I haven't signed anything with nobody and i've managed it all by myself Right, and I got the maximum money for everything Right, I mean so your strategy is uh, like Like Like prioritize the things Like Roi when I can let them do the roofs, you know, obviously that's very Demanding on the roof, right? If you if you didn't want to match that, what is it? So, I mean, uh, you're fine Because it's easier But I mean deciding I would like to think that you but you would be interested. It's pretty easy, you know I mean all that stuff is like easy I guess to me and you have like a really simple house Very simple blow to the ground roof for the garage. I mean, it's a nice actually job actually but the thing is is like I mean, I could give you a quote that's probably that's definitely better than like the competitors because i'm not like trying to put my kids Through college with your money but No, I get it. I'm just giving you this as an opportunity. You could make some money trying to do help I'm saying if I was you I would I would Prioritize the thing is like paying for the things that are going to make more money like like You know, basically put my money on your pocket later on And if that I mean, I guess I would it's all about who does what for how much? You know I mean, are you that's the reality money? When are you gonna have the money to do the bathroom and uh, The shower at the blaine house or the tree again, um Is there are still there Yeah, okay, that's good that's good All right, I can ask the question is You know, like I said, it's just like I need to get as much done with the amount of money I got as possible Yeah, like you're just saying maximize everything and try to stretch it as far as I can That's what i'm trying to do, right? So the damage I don't expect people to work for free But if I could get deals on things, um, you know, that'd be great, right? Right? So So the damage that's on your house that you're standing now Like by the roof and the siding What is it actually like as substantial as as like it is? So you get the insurance claim like is it? Really really really bad No, it's not super bad or anything it's just that um I had to go through the hoops of Waiting the time out to prove to them or for them to make sure that the siding's not available and then I pushed that issue Which thing is not available you have to cover everything and then they came back a week later and decided okay They're gonna pay for everything Yeah, and that's state farm you got too, right? Good job. Yeah It's a that's a hard one. Good job Um, I don't know Yeah, I guess I can do I can just start off by getting new quotes so that you can uh, you know Make those decisions on and on what you wanted to do um and if And um, well i'm talking to you as a friend, right? Right, right No, this is an opportunity. I got this coming on. So I mean obviously linda just wants it to be done and wants to pay the company and that's that right but so Right, if you could save us money and you wanted to help obviously I could be like hey He's gonna save his money and you're making some money. So it's like win-win, right? So Uh Right And to rip that shit down would be easy as fuck Yeah, yeah, I know usually the hard part is like, uh, you know the It's literally just a roof and just a side and goes up to this office this office independent Oh, you don't do any not not having to do this all that stuff. Okay Yeah, that's super easy Mm-hmm uh Yeah, well, let me um I'll give you a quote. I don't know how much I think it would be Uh, but I don't really i'll have to figure out like the size of your house without actually going over there Right now I got all the measurements. Oh you do. Can you all right? Yeah, just send them over with me then I mean, um I mean you've seen our house. I mean I mean I mean you got an idea what it looks like. I mean, I do have a pretty good idea. Yeah The roof is just straight up and straight down there ain't like on the garage there ain't shit there No pipes or nothing straight up and straight down One level garage easy as fuck Right, right. Yeah and then uh And so there's like actively like an actual tree at at the blaine location that needs to get taken care of like What tell me more about that? Let's kind of lean in toward the house and we want to cut it down The imminent danger No, not immediately, but I need to try to take care of this. I don't know I was saying I was saying about trying to rent a lift or something Yeah Um By the way, I just checked you're not blocked on here I was gonna climb the tree and put a rope in it, but That's what I would do Well, it leans out of the house so much so where I gotta rent a lift Yeah, I would put a fucking anchor and I would make an anchor like uh, Like just a concrete anchor and I would fasten like it I would fucking rent it and then You know like you see on on youtube Typically like fasten it like a telephone pole Hey, what I wish I owned a jlg man, that's what I can thank your money My jlg Is what's that It's got it's uh got four wheels. It's four drive. It's got a boom on it. You can drive it from the fucking boom Oh It's a beefy. It's a beefy thing, you know, it's got got some good off-road tires on it Yeah, yeah, you didn't see the the one that I had rented out Yeah, I had one at that house that you you seen in in minneapolis I rented it out for like, uh, I want to say like a week or like a little over a week I should get to be expensive. It does it does I was like fucking really stressing out pushing people to get that done I found one for 9 000 and something dollars for this broke down It's worth it Um Dude if I had if I had the money right now and I would I would uh, i've seen this fucking uh i've seen this fucking Uh 5 000. It was like a five or six thousand dollar scanner obd scanner like one of those really fucking nice snap-on ones um It was being sold on auction for like three or three somewhere in between like three and five hundred bucks But it was like a government owned item that's why they were like selling it at such a low cost You know about those online auctions Yeah, I would get one of those and fucking honestly I I i'm actively gonna get one of those It was like that's like a solve all your problems sort of thing because it comes with like everything you need Dude man, I got a problem with my shit. You know, the red car went and got yeah The ford escape the red one, right You helped me get the nissan but didn't you help me get the fred ford escape too Yeah, I did. Yeah. Yeah, the ford escape is black, right? No red Hmm. Oh, well, oh you didn't know you didn't have to get this one. I got this one from by myself like car dealer Okay, anyway It's fucking up On the on the escape Luckily I found a truck a parked car for 300 It's missing some doors and missing some, you know little stuff off of it. But for the most part everything's there For 300 bucks and i'm saying like again going again Yeah, try to fix it Dude my uh transmission Finally went out on my on my chevy Damn, really? Yeah, I went out on wednesday night. I was dropping a client off and it went out. So you're calling us right now Um, well, I mean i'm i'm fixing fixing it right now, but and gabby's still got her car Yeah, no, I I was gonna just replace the torque converter in it. But now I mean since I got a couple cars, I mean I get like I don't it's up to you. You tell me what you want to do and how much you want to charge to do some stuff and Take this in consideration. We're trying to get as much done as possible. So I I got a car out there that beat the cross. I mean hell all it needs is fucking hydraulic lifters We could put this in the deal. You can have it Give you another car It needs hydraulic lifters I've already got it all apart and everything hydraulic lifters are bad. I was um Let's say I was gonna I was gonna go to a pull apart and try to get some actually Hopefully the car that I took apart still sitting over there Hydraulic lifters and it's for what kind of vehicle 2010 vehicle across That's a nice car it's got a panoramic sunroof got lead interior remote start I got some new keys made with for it That's a pretty nice car, it's got a v6 in it, it's pretty powerful Unless you wanted another car No Yeah, no, i'm interested Helps me kind of move one of my cars and helps you get one for cheap and it helps it, you know Yeah, yeah i'm looking uh, do you already have the parts or you said you have not gotten the parts yet I can go up to pull apart and get them tomorrow Like I'm planning to go get them today possibly I might just go get them today because I need to get that taken care of Like the engine's already taken apart at pull apart. I just reach in there and pull them out Yeah, I went over there and pulled the fender off the car and then I just pulled the fender off the car I went over there and pulled the phasers off of it And bought them and then I decided well, I don't know what what was really wrong with it So I got all brand new timing chain kits and everything for it You're doing it why you just got the Timing chain and all that for like in cases. Yeah No, I already took it all apart. Oh It's taken apart all I gotta do is put all that together It's very easy to put together I got all the specialty tools and stuff it's pretty easy That's good um Have you worked on that motor yet or not? Yeah, the buick lacrosse I yeah, I really can't remember if I did. I know I scanned it. That's I know that for sure Well, i'm talking about in the past you've ever worked on a 3.6 or 3.0 or for buick or no They're all pretty much the same engine I mean, I know that uh buick and I think toriata might be sister vehicles. I think I have in that sense Yeah I don't know. It's just like another Option If you wanted it or whatever, I don't care And you already have it this isn't at your house though. Yeah, it's at my house And you're certain that the hydraulic lifters are oh, yeah 100 okay 100 100 Because I took them all out I cleaned them and then I put them all back some pumped up some did not Okay so If they won't bump up the back, this isn't like a vehicle that had a cracked head gasket on it before is it? No Okay No, this one, um, this one needed new catalytic converters and then um It had it had like a knocking sound but but it ran good but the way that this engine is designed is if the Hydraulic lifters are going bad or failing or not working properly. It'll cause it to run bad because it makes the timing be off Yeah. Yeah, that's called throwing a rod No, I didn't throw no rod I mean because that's how it's throwing a rod starts No, well not really because it's like, um, well it just depends but the engine's fine it runs fine Hmm but the ticking is it do you got a knock sensor, uh code coming up? No, it's the hydraulic lifters But are we still talking about the same vehicle the one with the with the ticking There's no yeah, that's what i'm telling you. Yeah, it's the same vehicle There's no ticking. It's more like a knocking But it will do that if the hydraulic lifters are like not properly working Because it's called lash it puts there's a like it like I don't know how to explain this but No, you're into it. You're good. I got The lifter like lashes against the damn cam Cam Because this shit ain't working properly. If so, basically if the if a hydraulic lifter collapsed, it don't even open the damn, you know Nothing it's just basically just moving and making a hell of a lot of racket like it's got a knocking I got you um Yeah, what it is the damn lifters get full of crud and metal and dirt and over time, you know It's not something you normally would service Right But it is very dependent on the oil changes and people don't like changing the oil and they just like driving Yeah And this is not at your house though, no, it's at my house, okay, okay Yeah I'm just saying that's that's a nice little car, you know something i'm gonna Pretty easy to fix at this point. I done did all the work to it. You just got to pick it up to little parts And put it back together Yeah And how soon are you trying to get do that like, um, basically as soon as possible For the car. Yeah I don't know as soon as I can that's if you if you wanted to Wanted it and then also if you're gonna do any work for us on the house. Oh, I got you Right And you wanted to kind of figure what's the what do you figure the value of the vehicle is over overall and how much do you put into it and How much does it do? Let me see about one right now probably 3500 Okay, maybe maybe 4 000 Just a pan You know depends It depends on a few factors like they make them with just a key and the one I got's a push button start You know make them with just a sunroof and the one I got's a full top is glass The panoramic sunroof so all these key factors, you know kind of factoring what the value would be if I want Right It's got remote start So Yeah Oh, oh is it the red one it's the red one, isn't it My car yeah the beautiful cross Yeah, it's a red car. Yeah. Okay I've had a few of them. I've had a great one a silver one. Yeah, I had two red ones So you may be thinking about a different red one, but yes, it looks the same, okay Because I had one with a key and this is the one I haven't this is a push button like a different one Yeah I saw the other one to an old lady of her thing Yeah, I remember you the old lady one Well She still dropped that car every day Yeah Yeah, um So I guess today I go the rest of my day today, uh, I got to go Try to make it to fucking uh abco And I get a new transmission. That's like used and um Put it back in this my in this truck right quick because i've already got it the transmission out I was just going to do the torque converter and um But I guess uh, there's actually more eternal damage like the the transmission pump Which is like connected to the torque converter. I guess that must have gotten some sort of damage When you know this whole thing happened Yeah, i'm a We've got it all jacked up right now all nice and luxurious and my buddy's uh garage That's where i'm at right now I would know ogilvy. Have you ever do this? Uh, I can't oh, can you still hear me? Yeah, I hear you Yeah, have you ever been to the that junkyard, uh, but not too far from where you live called like, uh blimp blammers I've been the pole part Co part Pull apart. Oh the little art part. Yeah, right on the 65. Yeah, that's where you should be trying to go to get your part I'm gonna give them again. You don't never know you may get a bad one, but they do warrant it But you gotta take it out yourself. That's the key here Yeah Yeah, i'm gonna have to fucking bring a I'm gonna have to bring this uh transmission i'm looking at with me when I go today It is cheaper if you pull it yourself they do charge a lot less I mean abco I already talked to them and they're like they'll sell me a used one for like 345 bucks And it comes with a torque converter and everything But that's actually not bad. Yeah, but the thing is is like it's like used it's not like rebuilt or anything. So it's like Oh, yeah still Yeah, rising 600 something dollars eight hundred dollars shit right And I their stuff comes warrantied for like 30 days. I think I think you pull our parts is like a year Yeah, I don't know how long they get warranty for I have no idea I mean, I know that the you pull our parts was an awesome warranty Like it's like a year or even like sometimes it's like a lifetime That's pretty cool, I didn't even know that myself Yeah, but yeah, I guess Abko, I I do like abco a lot. I don't know Yeah, uh, anyways, I gotta call those two places before they close and um if I if i'm uh Yeah, if I come through the that direction which I can almost guarantee I am I'll give you a call before I come through that area. Uh Or maybe on my way back if it's not too late All right, so, um You think you want to try to attempt to do any of this stuff we got going on or you're not really sure Yeah, I mean, I think I I think i'm interested. I but I think like, uh, I mean it's a lot going on It ain't like you can get it all done by yourself or in one day. It's kind of i'm like you know If you want, I mean, so here's the thing. Here's the situation situation is is if we let it like I know we're dealing with like 11 or 12 thousand dollars in depreciation So if I attempt to do this myself that we'd lose ten ten thousand dollars Right. That's pretty much how this would work and or and or deductible Right so that's the that's what i'm losing by attempting to try to do it myself or have or Without involving companies with license, you know what I mean? Right Right. Yeah, so All right, and that's a lot actually that is kind of a lot and it's a kind of a huge risk that you're taking Well, I don't know about the risk but it is you know, I can if I can do xyz and you know for instance, um You know I could like I could do this if I find the right companies to work with Like I could remove all the shingles and I could remove all the side and just only pay them to come and install it You know, yeah They'd have to deduct, you know, what it would cost for them to come in and remove it because i'm asking for itemized um estimates Right and not all companies are willing to actually do partial of the of the job for some reason They want it all I guess To me that's greedy because who gives a shit as long as you're getting some work who cares? I mean, yeah, I mean but you on the other hand you do know what it what it's like To finish like work on somebody something that somebody else has worked on. It can be frustrating if you strip the house down, I mean I mean that could be up to three thousand dollars in savings if I just by taking the siding off and the roofing off Right You know and how long does it really take the loan to take off a day yeah probably one guy one like a day Yeah You know, so, you know what I mean exactly like I'm looking at that because that if I could save money looking at that way and then um Like our garage doors or i'm not going to replace that so i'm gonna take that money and apply that to trying to work on Other stuff, right? And we've got one window that's that's estimated for them to replace but we're not going to replace that because I think it's around five Five thousand dollars itself and i'm gonna take that and apply this to other stuff, right? So that's ten thousand So but we got to build two decks so And then i'm see i'm see another thing is i'm trying to see if I can Um, you go and buy everything from menards and have men are menards rebates along the way I'm kind of hoping on that. I don't know wishful thinking maybe i'm not sure but It will be helpful because it's a lot of money, you know what I mean and then having 11% cash back that's huge actually uh Here, let me call you back. Uh, william All right, i'll talk to you Yeah, I didn't block you on facebook I just double checked but i'll call you back okay.

Hey, this is Brian. Sorry, I just missed your call. I was on another phone call. Oh, no, that's okay. How you doing? Good, you? I'm doing all right. I'm doing all right. I only got a little bit of time to talk between what I'm doing right now. But, yeah, I just kind of wanted to give you a call back and kind of, so what information you got and what are we talking about? How much time you got, I guess. With like what? Oh, how much time do I got? Probably no more than 20 minutes. Oh, that's easy. Yeah, I can explain over the phone here. So basically what your options are, they're stopping your 401k match program at work, right, and you guys are looking to transfer things out. Are we talking about with my current work or are we talking about with my union like pension or something? Current work with Recovery Community Network. Okay. Okay. Are you not aware of this? I was told your guys' 401ks are being shut down in like two weeks, and you got two weeks to roll them over to avoid some fees. Yeah, I have not been informed of this at all, but have you spoken to anybody else in my company? I have, yeah. I met with some people today, but I'm technically not allowed to give names. No, you don't have to. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't the only person that you had spoken with. No, I've met with two other people already, and then I got two more appointments with them next week to do the rollover of their 401ks. Okay. And then so our 401k, Generation Hope establishes, was with Thrivent or was someplace else, but it needs to be rolled over to some other place. Otherwise, it's not going to be whatever. They're going to make you pay some fees on it. Basically, you have to get it out. I believe the people who are managing your works 401k is called Paychex, with an X on the end. I work for Thrivent, and so basically what I'm offering is I can help you get that money out of the Paychex account and into a Thrivent account with me, is essentially what I'm offering to help with. And we have a couple different account options, kind of depends on, because your 401k money right now is untaxed, right? And so we can roll it over to another personal untaxed account, essentially. But if it's a small enough amounts, like if it's only a couple grand or so, what I've been recommending is pay tax on that money and put it into a Roth IRA, which is a non-taxable account for retirement. So I'll be honest, it's a lot easier to explain in person, but if you haven't heard about the 401k shutdown, I would maybe talk to whoever you need to talk to at RCN to get some more information about that. But like I said, I know that this is happening and I was told this morning that the deadline for you guys is about two weeks out. Okay. That's my offer. That's my offer basically is I can help you get the money out of that Paychex system. And I don't have all the details, but it sounds like if you guys like don't get it out in time, I'm going to make you pay. It sounds like they're just going to send you guys the checks. And so then you'll have to pay the taxes on that as long as well as a 10% penalty for taking out, we're taking the money out before retirement age. Basically, if you rolled over with me and thrive, you would not have that 10% penalty and we would keep the money in a retirement account for when you go past age 59 and a half, then you can use it without the 10% penalty. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm just going to check. And how much, how much is the fees to work with you? Um, it kind of depends on like what account we put you in and like what investments. If I go ahead and assume at most that your 401k is going to be, um, like less than 5,000, it would be, um, you paid me 0.85% annually. Um, so like if you give me a hundred dollars, um, you're basically going to pay me like 85 cents a year. And, um, then depending on what investment I put you in, there might be like an expense fee for that as well. So in total you could be looking anywhere from 1.5 to about 1.8, 1.9. Um, but it kind of depends on like what I put you in. Right. Okay. Um, all right. Let me, uh, let me kind of gather my information from paychecks and, and have a discussion with somebody that's smarter than me at my office. And then I got your phone. Yeah. And I'll make an appointment with you sometime between, uh, sometime before next, the end of next week, next week. Cause that isn't true. Cause that, uh, deadline. Right. Yeah. That's what I was told this morning. Yeah. I'm not sure on the exact states I'm thinking. I'm pretty sure two weeks out means Friday the 7th of November. All right. I'll make a note of that right now. And you said your name, I'm terrible, terrible with names, but did you say your name was Brian? Brian to B-R-Y-A-N-T. Okay. All right. Perfect. All right. I got it now. All right. Well, thank you, Brian. I'm going to give you a call back. If you, uh, real quick, do you know who Nicole couches? Uh, I would have to say I'm not familiar with that name at all. Okay. I know she works at RCN. If that name, if that person is in your office, talk to her. Um, okay. You work, you, you work at the RCN building in St. Cloud, right? It's on division. Uh, no, no, no. That's a, that's actually a sister company of ours. Oh, yeah. We're, uh, I'm actually formerly with a company called generation hope. Uh, they're based out of Minneapolis and St. Cloud and, and actually kind of a large number of other cities throughout the Minnesota. Okay. I really apologize then if you're a sister company, this might not be happening to you. And that's why you didn't hear about it. RCN RCN is 401k program is being like canceled. So those people need to get their money out. Otherwise they're going to have to, they're going to be hit with that 10% fee. Okay. Well, I apologize about that. If you're, if you don't work for RCN, you should be fine. Um, I had you in a list of, uh, papers and phone numbers. I thought you worked for RCN. I apologize. Well, because I was in that one meeting where your company was present. Yeah. Okay. Oh, so I mean, I might even remember meeting you then in that case. Yeah. I was there at that meeting. It was, uh, I was the man. And then we had the Anne Henrickson, the woman as well. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I remember. Cool. Okay. I, yeah, I apologize about that. Then I thought you worked for RCN and I'm like, you got two weeks to get your money out. Yeah. Yeah. It makes sense. I understand. And thank you. Thank you for, uh, you know, what you do in that company. And, uh, yeah, it sounds like, I suppose I don't need to follow up on it, but I'll still probably mention it, uh, just in case it is like valid to us or some way or another. Yeah. Well, sorry. Yeah.

Hi. How's it going? Good. I just got off the phone with Danielle. Her name was from the Rosenberg Center. She's very nice, but I was on the phone with her for like 30 minutes, so I can't talk long. But I made a few appointments. I have an intake for Alex for on Halloween Day at 920 a.m. And then we already scheduled his follow-up appointment, which is going to be November 18th at 11 a.m. And then later that afternoon, Atlas has an intake at 1 p.m. Hello? I can hear you. Yeah, I can hear you, I said. Yeah, I just squirted, accidentally squirted myself in the eye with some break cleaner. So I figured it was a good time to maybe take a little break and maybe, I don't know. Are you okay? Did you wash your eye out? No, I just kind of like, you know, did my best to wipe out whatever was going on there. Okay, that sounds scary, but okay. Yeah, it was fun. So you got a hold of the place that you're going to be doing the assessment for Alex, you said? Yes, they got a hold of me. They called me. But I made appointments for Alex and Atlas. Okay. Yeah, so I don't know. I don't know. I feel like I want to reach out to the county again and just like, hey, like we have these tickets lined up, like the second we get, you know, a diagnosis, is it going to be like simple or is it going to take forever? So that like when I tell the fucking daycare, like maybe I can convince them to give us a little bit more time or something. I think we should go like, yeah, I think we should go. I think we should just like start looking for a new daycare. Yeah, I mean, we're not going to get all the way through this process. I mean, because I mean, if the diagnostic is on the 31st, I mean, it takes them like a while to like come up with a report. I know. And then the follow up is on the 18th of November. Yeah. Okay, understood. But I mean, yeah, I guess whether we just like let it go or not, like, if I want to keep using my fucking like scholarship, like I need to find a place that's four star rated and I should probably call them and ask like, hey, like, are you guys going to take it away if he's like getting kicked out? Or like, how long do I have to find a new place? I mean, let's just start looking for him now. I understand that. Did you hear what I just said? Yeah. Yeah, so it has to be a specific daycare has to be four star rated. And on top of it, like, I don't know if like, they're going to take it away if like, it's on his record that he's getting kicked out of a daycare. You know what I mean? I feel like it shouldn't be because it's not like it's not like he's like overtly like violent. Like, yeah, his record is of somewhat violence, but it's because he doesn't want to put his fucking shoes on. I mean, like, well, if we transfer him before that happens, it's not gonna Brandon, do you know how daycares work? You like need to register and like, they need to have like openings, like daycares don't just have openings, like you have to be put on a waitlist. Well, I'm sure that this process isn't much different than any other, but I will consider all those things that we don't want to happen and I'll help things along any way that I can. Okay. Oh, yeah. So I mean, I will do some of my due diligence. Yeah, like I could send you the there's like a website that you can look at that kind of shows you all the ones that are four star rated. Okay. But are you almost done fixing your car? No, I had to go back one step. Like I had to take the torque converter back out. And because it wasn't like seated in there properly. I don't know. It's like I've been like messing with it for a couple of hours now. And some of that a lot of that was like, well, half of that was probably just watching the videos that are related to it. Because what I've learned so far, was how to determine if it was like not seated in there properly. And when I looked, I was like, yeah, that's not in there. Right. So right. And if I don't want to help you again today, he's at a dentist appointment at the U of M right now. Oh, damn. Right. All right. Yeah. So what time do you get off work today? For well, I get off at four. But since we have to pick up, if I have to pick you up and pick up the kids, like I have to leave here by like, 345 ish, I think. I wouldn't worry about picking me up today. Okay. All right. Well, still got to leave somewhere around that time because I'm like, Buffalo is like an hour and 20 minutes away from the house. So I leave at like 350 then to go pick up the boys. Okay. All right. Give me a call in a little while. All right. Sounds good.
