    "transcript": "Hello, hello. Hi. How's it going? Good. I just got off the phone with Danielle. Her name was from the Rosenberg Center. She's very nice, but I was on the phone with her for like 30 minutes, so I can't talk long. But I made a few appointments. I have an intake for Alex for on Halloween Day at 920 a.m. And then we already scheduled his follow-up appointment, which is going to be November 18th at 11 a.m. And then later that afternoon, Atlas has an intake at 1 p.m. Hello? I can hear you. Yeah, I can hear you, I said. Yeah, I just squirted, accidentally squirted myself in the eye with some break cleaner. So I figured it was a good time to maybe take a little break and maybe, I don't know. Are you okay? Did you wash your eye out? No, I just kind of like, you know, did my best to wipe out whatever was going on there. Okay, that sounds scary, but okay. Yeah, it was fun. So you got a hold of the place that you're going to be doing the assessment for Alex, you said? Yes, they got a hold of me. They called me. But I made appointments for Alex and Atlas. Okay. Yeah, so I don't know. I don't know. I feel like I want to reach out to the county again and just like, hey, like we have these tickets lined up, like the second we get, you know, a diagnosis, is it going to be like simple or is it going to take forever? So that like when I tell the fucking daycare, like maybe I can convince them to give us a little bit more time or something. I think we should go like, yeah, I think we should go. I think we should just like start looking for a new daycare. Yeah, I mean, we're not going to get all the way through this process. I mean, because I mean, if the diagnostic is on the 31st, I mean, it takes them like a while to like come up with a report. I know. And then the follow up is on the 18th of November. Yeah. Okay, understood. But I mean, yeah, I guess whether we just like let it go or not, like, if I want to keep using my fucking like scholarship, like I need to find a place that's four star rated and I should probably call them and ask like, hey, like, are you guys going to take it away if he's like getting kicked out? Or like, how long do I have to find a new place? I mean, let's just start looking for him now. I understand that. Did you hear what I just said? Yeah. Yeah, so it has to be a specific daycare has to be four star rated. And on top of it, like, I don't know if like, they're going to take it away if like, it's on his record that he's getting kicked out of a daycare. You know what I mean? I feel like it shouldn't be because it's not like it's not like he's like overtly like violent. Like, yeah, his record is of somewhat violence, but it's because he doesn't want to put his fucking shoes on. I mean, like, well, if we transfer him before that happens, it's not gonna Brandon, do you know how daycares work? You like need to register and like, they need to have like openings, like daycares don't just have openings, like you have to be put on a waitlist. Well, I'm sure that this process isn't much different than any other, but I will consider all those things that we don't want to happen and I'll help things along any way that I can. Okay. Oh, yeah. So I mean, I will do some of my due diligence. Yeah, like I could send you the there's like a website that you can look at that kind of shows you all the ones that are four star rated. Okay. But are you almost done fixing your car? No, I had to go back one step. Like I had to take the torque converter back out. And because it wasn't like seated in there properly. I don't know. It's like I've been like messing with it for a couple of hours now. And some of that a lot of that was like, well, half of that was probably just watching the videos that are related to it. Because what I've learned so far, was how to determine if it was like not seated in there properly. And when I looked, I was like, yeah, that's not in there. Right. So right. And if I don't want to help you again today, he's at a dentist appointment at the U of M right now. Oh, damn. Right. All right. Yeah. So what time do you get off work today? For well, I get off at four. But since we have to pick up, if I have to pick you up and pick up the kids, like I have to leave here by like, 345 ish, I think. I wouldn't worry about picking me up today. Okay. All right. Well, still got to leave somewhere around that time because I'm like, Buffalo is like an hour and 20 minutes away from the house. So I leave at like 350 then to go pick up the boys. Okay. All right. Give me a call in a little while. All right. Sounds good. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello, this is Brandon. Hey, this is Brian. Sorry, I just missed your call. I was on another phone call. Oh, no, that's okay. How you doing? Good, you? I'm doing all right. I'm doing all right. I only got a little bit of time to talk between what I'm doing right now. But, yeah, I just kind of wanted to give you a call back and kind of, so what information you got and what are we talking about? How much time you got, I guess. With like what? Oh, how much time do I got? Probably no more than 20 minutes. Oh, that's easy. Yeah, I can explain over the phone here. So basically what your options are, they're stopping your 401k match program at work, right, and you guys are looking to transfer things out. Are we talking about with my current work or are we talking about with my union like pension or something? Current work with Recovery Community Network. Okay. Okay. Are you not aware of this? I was told your guys' 401ks are being shut down in like two weeks, and you got two weeks to roll them over to avoid some fees. Yeah, I have not been informed of this at all, but have you spoken to anybody else in my company? I have, yeah. I met with some people today, but I'm technically not allowed to give names. No, you don't have to. I just wanted to make sure that I wasn't the only person that you had spoken with. No, I've met with two other people already, and then I got two more appointments with them next week to do the rollover of their 401ks. Okay. And then so our 401k, Generation Hope establishes, was with Thrivent or was someplace else, but it needs to be rolled over to some other place. Otherwise, it's not going to be whatever. They're going to make you pay some fees on it. Basically, you have to get it out. I believe the people who are managing your works 401k is called Paychex, with an X on the end. I work for Thrivent, and so basically what I'm offering is I can help you get that money out of the Paychex account and into a Thrivent account with me, is essentially what I'm offering to help with. And we have a couple different account options, kind of depends on, because your 401k money right now is untaxed, right? And so we can roll it over to another personal untaxed account, essentially. But if it's a small enough amounts, like if it's only a couple grand or so, what I've been recommending is pay tax on that money and put it into a Roth IRA, which is a non-taxable account for retirement. So I'll be honest, it's a lot easier to explain in person, but if you haven't heard about the 401k shutdown, I would maybe talk to whoever you need to talk to at RCN to get some more information about that. But like I said, I know that this is happening and I was told this morning that the deadline for you guys is about two weeks out. Okay. That's my offer. That's my offer basically is I can help you get the money out of that Paychex system. And I don't have all the details, but it sounds like if you guys like don't get it out in time, I'm going to make you pay. It sounds like they're just going to send you guys the checks. And so then you'll have to pay the taxes on that as long as well as a 10% penalty for taking out, we're taking the money out before retirement age. Basically, if you rolled over with me and thrive, you would not have that 10% penalty and we would keep the money in a retirement account for when you go past age 59 and a half, then you can use it without the 10% penalty. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Okay. Okay. All right. I'm just going to check. And how much, how much is the fees to work with you? Um, it kind of depends on like what account we put you in and like what investments. If I go ahead and assume at most that your 401k is going to be, um, like less than 5,000, it would be, um, you paid me 0.85% annually. Um, so like if you give me a hundred dollars, um, you're basically going to pay me like 85 cents a year. And, um, then depending on what investment I put you in, there might be like an expense fee for that as well. So in total you could be looking anywhere from 1.5 to about 1.8, 1.9. Um, but it kind of depends on like what I put you in. Right. Okay. Um, all right. Let me, uh, let me kind of gather my information from paychecks and, and have a discussion with somebody that's smarter than me at my office. And then I got your phone. Yeah. And I'll make an appointment with you sometime between, uh, sometime before next, the end of next week, next week. Cause that isn't true. Cause that, uh, deadline. Right. Yeah. That's what I was told this morning. Yeah. I'm not sure on the exact states I'm thinking. I'm pretty sure two weeks out means Friday the 7th of November. All right. I'll make a note of that right now. And you said your name, I'm terrible, terrible with names, but did you say your name was Brian? Brian to B-R-Y-A-N-T. Okay. All right. Perfect. All right. I got it now. All right. Well, thank you, Brian. I'm going to give you a call back. If you, uh, real quick, do you know who Nicole couches? Uh, I would have to say I'm not familiar with that name at all. Okay. I know she works at RCN. If that name, if that person is in your office, talk to her. Um, okay. You work, you, you work at the RCN building in St. Cloud, right? It's on division. Uh, no, no, no. That's a, that's actually a sister company of ours. Oh, yeah. We're, uh, I'm actually formerly with a company called generation hope. Uh, they're based out of Minneapolis and St. Cloud and, and actually kind of a large number of other cities throughout the Minnesota. Okay. I really apologize then if you're a sister company, this might not be happening to you. And that's why you didn't hear about it. RCN RCN is 401k program is being like canceled. So those people need to get their money out. Otherwise they're going to have to, they're going to be hit with that 10% fee. Okay. Well, I apologize about that. If you're, if you don't work for RCN, you should be fine. Um, I had you in a list of, uh, papers and phone numbers. I thought you worked for RCN. I apologize. Well, because I was in that one meeting where your company was present. Yeah. Okay. Oh, so I mean, I might even remember meeting you then in that case. Yeah. I was there at that meeting. It was, uh, I was the man. And then we had the Anne Henrickson, the woman as well. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. I remember. Cool. Okay. I, yeah, I apologize about that. Then I thought you worked for RCN and I'm like, you got two weeks to get your money out. Yeah. Yeah. It makes sense. I understand. And thank you. Thank you for, uh, you know, what you do in that company. And, uh, yeah, it sounds like, I suppose I don't need to follow up on it, but I'll still probably mention it, uh, just in case it is like valid to us or some way or another. Yeah. Well, sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry about that. You're good. You're good. All right. You have a nice day. Yep. You too. I'll see you later. Yep.",

That it wasn't just my torque converter that got damaged in this thing. Oh, man. Yeah, it's like the transmission pump and possibly like something else, but um. So at this point you might as well just get a whole transmission or what? Yeah, that's the decision that's on my mind. Like, could I return the torque converter and like the jack and then just get a used transmission? Like, I think that that's probably what I should do. Um. Right. Because that way I would like basically skip all that. Right. Hi. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Um. All right. Well, I'm gonna start kind of calling around. And um. Yeah, I guess clean up around here.

I'm not even on facebook Yeah, you are Well, I mean, I don't have an account but it's only for like messenger Yeah, let me go on I did try to message you though on facebook Yeah, but it wouldn't let me I just want the cheap four dollar meal or five dollar meal Five dollar meals. Are you gonna make a cheeseburger? Yep. That looks good. Yep Dr. Pepper I don't need any Yep No, sir Wendy's man So got that couple dollar meal Everybody else wants ten dollars Yeah Yeah, no, it says what you said. Were you working at? um, yeah, I got a job working at uh, i'm I'm, basically like a life coach for people with substance abuse issues That's what's up, yeah, you can see you're excelling at that Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's pretty pretty cool. It's fulfilling Super rewarding. Do you have any free time? Um, yeah, yeah pretty demanding I mean it is uh, it is kind of I don't know to tell you the truth. It's the lowest It's really I really I like doing it a lot, but it's the lowest paying job i've ever had in my life But it's the lowest paying job i've ever had in my life Damn, so i've been uh, I want I want to ask you a question what I know I can't pay you buku money I know you would love to charge that but want to help me do some siding on my house. I gotta pay you Um, like seriously the whole house in the garage the whole house Whole garage I need to do the roots too But are you yeah, that would be more like a you thing than anything on the roof homie do you guys have a uh insurance like home insurance Um, i've got everything covered money-wise I mean because the thing with the roof like and siding I mean you you get like if you have insurance I could get you an approval and That way like all that's been handled I'm saying all that's been handled. So i'm trying to determine if I want to try to tackle it myself and save some money or Let the vultures have it because that's what it's going to happen Oh, so you already you already processed the claim on both of those things. Yeah, i'm done with yeah I'm done with everything. All I do is just figure out what I want to do Um So if it's going to save me some money and we actually have some left over that would be great Here's what we're trying to do. We're trying to do the roofs on the house. We're trying to do siding on the house We're trying to cut down a tree at the other house in blaine. We're trying to also build two decks Okay, uh, this is everything we're trying to do And as you know, we got a set amount of money from the insurance company But there's a lot that we want and we want to install a shower Or bathtub and walls in the in the blaine house as well. So those those are the things we're trying to get accomplished I see I would uh, if I was it would be great if we could make all this happen within this money, that'd be awesome But dealing with big companies, you know, they obviously don't go that route. But Yeah, I am in power of everything and I haven't signed anything with nobody and i've managed it all by myself Right, and I got the maximum money for everything Right, I mean so your strategy is uh, like Like Like prioritize the things Like Roi when I can let them do the roofs, you know, obviously that's very Demanding on the roof, right? If you if you didn't want to match that, what is it? So, I mean, uh, you're fine Because it's easier But I mean deciding I would like to think that you but you would be interested. It's pretty easy, you know I mean all that stuff is like easy I guess to me and you have like a really simple house Very simple blow to the ground roof for the garage. I mean, it's a nice actually job actually but the thing is is like I mean, I could give you a quote that's probably that's definitely better than like the competitors because i'm not like trying to put my kids Through college with your money but No, I get it. I'm just giving you this as an opportunity. You could make some money trying to do help I'm saying if I was you I would I would Prioritize the thing is like paying for the things that are going to make more money like like You know, basically put my money on your pocket later on And if that I mean, I guess I would it's all about who does what for how much? You know I mean, are you that's the reality money? When are you gonna have the money to do the bathroom and uh, The shower at the blaine house or the tree again, um Is there are still there Yeah, okay, that's good that's good All right, I can ask the question is You know, like I said, it's just like I need to get as much done with the amount of money I got as possible Yeah, like you're just saying maximize everything and try to stretch it as far as I can That's what i'm trying to do, right? So the damage I don't expect people to work for free But if I could get deals on things, um, you know, that'd be great, right? Right? So So the damage that's on your house that you're standing now Like by the roof and the siding What is it actually like as substantial as as like it is? So you get the insurance claim like is it? Really really really bad No, it's not super bad or anything it's just that um I had to go through the hoops of Waiting the time out to prove to them or for them to make sure that the siding's not available and then I pushed that issue Which thing is not available you have to cover everything and then they came back a week later and decided okay They're gonna pay for everything Yeah, and that's state farm you got too, right? Good job. Yeah It's a that's a hard one. Good job Um, I don't know Yeah, I guess I can do I can just start off by getting new quotes so that you can uh, you know Make those decisions on and on what you wanted to do um and if And um, well i'm talking to you as a friend, right? Right, right No, this is an opportunity. I got this coming on. So I mean obviously linda just wants it to be done and wants to pay the company and that's that right but so Right, if you could save us money and you wanted to help obviously I could be like hey He's gonna save his money and you're making some money. So it's like win-win, right? So Uh Right And to rip that shit down would be easy as fuck Yeah, yeah, I know usually the hard part is like, uh, you know the It's literally just a roof and just a side and goes up to this office this office independent Oh, you don't do any not not having to do this all that stuff. Okay Yeah, that's super easy Mm-hmm uh Yeah, well, let me um I'll give you a quote. I don't know how much I think it would be Uh, but I don't really i'll have to figure out like the size of your house without actually going over there Right now I got all the measurements. Oh you do. Can you all right? Yeah, just send them over with me then I mean, um I mean you've seen our house. I mean I mean I mean you got an idea what it looks like. I mean, I do have a pretty good idea. Yeah The roof is just straight up and straight down there ain't like on the garage there ain't shit there No pipes or nothing straight up and straight down One level garage easy as fuck Right, right. Yeah and then uh And so there's like actively like an actual tree at at the blaine location that needs to get taken care of like What tell me more about that? Let's kind of lean in toward the house and we want to cut it down The imminent danger No, not immediately, but I need to try to take care of this. I don't know I was saying I was saying about trying to rent a lift or something Yeah Um By the way, I just checked you're not blocked on here I was gonna climb the tree and put a rope in it, but That's what I would do Well, it leans out of the house so much so where I gotta rent a lift Yeah, I would put a fucking anchor and I would make an anchor like uh, Like just a concrete anchor and I would fasten like it I would fucking rent it and then You know like you see on on youtube Typically like fasten it like a telephone pole Hey, what I wish I owned a jlg man, that's what I can thank your money My jlg Is what's that It's got it's uh got four wheels. It's four drive. It's got a boom on it. You can drive it from the fucking boom Oh It's a beefy. It's a beefy thing, you know, it's got got some good off-road tires on it Yeah, yeah, you didn't see the the one that I had rented out Yeah, I had one at that house that you you seen in in minneapolis I rented it out for like, uh, I want to say like a week or like a little over a week I should get to be expensive. It does it does I was like fucking really stressing out pushing people to get that done I found one for 9 000 and something dollars for this broke down It's worth it Um Dude if I had if I had the money right now and I would I would uh, i've seen this fucking uh i've seen this fucking Uh 5 000. It was like a five or six thousand dollar scanner obd scanner like one of those really fucking nice snap-on ones um It was being sold on auction for like three or three somewhere in between like three and five hundred bucks But it was like a government owned item that's why they were like selling it at such a low cost You know about those online auctions Yeah, I would get one of those and fucking honestly I I i'm actively gonna get one of those It was like that's like a solve all your problems sort of thing because it comes with like everything you need Dude man, I got a problem with my shit. You know, the red car went and got yeah The ford escape the red one, right You helped me get the nissan but didn't you help me get the fred ford escape too Yeah, I did. Yeah.

So you're calling us right now Um, well, I mean i'm i'm fixing fixing it right now, but and gabby's still got her car Yeah, no, I I was gonna just replace the torque converter in it. But now I mean since I got a couple cars, I mean I get like I don't it's up to you. You tell me what you want to do and how much you want to charge to do some stuff and Take this in consideration. We're trying to get as much done as possible. So I I got a car out there that beat the cross. I mean hell all it needs is fucking hydraulic lifters We could put this in the deal. You can have it Give you another car It needs hydraulic lifters I've already got it all apart and everything hydraulic lifters are bad. I was um Let's say I was gonna I was gonna go to a pull apart and try to get some actually Hopefully the car that I took apart still sitting over there Hydraulic lifters and it's for what kind of vehicle 2010 vehicle across That's a nice car it's got a panoramic sunroof got lead interior remote start I got some new keys made with for it That's a pretty nice car, it's got a v6 in it, it's pretty powerful Unless you wanted another car No Yeah, no, i'm interested Helps me kind of move one of my cars and helps you get one for cheap and it helps it, you know Yeah, yeah i'm looking uh, do you already have the parts or you said you have not gotten the parts yet I can go up to pull apart and get them tomorrow Like I'm planning to go get them today possibly I might just go get them today because I need to get that taken care of Like the engine's already taken apart at pull apart. I just reach in there and pull them out Yeah, I went over there and pulled the fender off the car and then I just pulled the fender off the car I went over there and pulled the phasers off of it And bought them and then I decided well, I don't know what what was really wrong with it So I got all brand new timing chain kits and everything for it You're doing it why you just got the Timing chain and all that for like in cases. Yeah No, I already took it all apart. Oh It's taken apart all I gotta do is put all that together It's very easy to put together I got all the specialty tools and stuff it's pretty easy That's good um Have you worked on that motor yet or not? Yeah, the buick lacrosse I yeah, I really can't remember if I did. I know I scanned it. That's I know that for sure Well, i'm talking about in the past you've ever worked on a 3.6 or 3.0 or for buick or no They're all pretty much the same engine I mean, I know that uh buick and I think toriata might be sister vehicles. I think I have in that sense Yeah I don't know. It's just like another Option If you wanted it or whatever, I don't care And you already have it this isn't at your house though. Yeah, it's at my house And you're certain that the hydraulic lifters are oh, yeah 100 okay 100 100 Because I took them all out I cleaned them and then I put them all back some pumped up some did not Okay so If they won't bump up the back, this isn't like a vehicle that had a cracked head gasket on it before is it? No Okay No, this one, um, this one needed new catalytic converters and then um It had it had like a knocking sound but but it ran good but the way that this engine is designed is if the Hydraulic lifters are going bad or failing or not working properly. It'll cause it to run bad because it makes the timing be off Yeah. Yeah, that's called throwing a rod No, I didn't throw no rod I mean because that's how it's throwing a rod starts No, well not really because it's like, um, well it just depends but the engine's fine it runs fine Hmm but the ticking is it do you got a knock sensor, uh code coming up? No, it's the hydraulic lifters But are we still talking about the same vehicle the one with the with the ticking There's no yeah, that's what i'm telling you. Yeah, it's the same vehicle There's no ticking. It's more like a knocking But it will do that if the hydraulic lifters are like not properly working Because it's called lash it puts there's a like it like I don't know how to explain this but No, you're into it. You're good. I got The lifter like lashes against the damn cam Cam Because this shit ain't working properly. If so, basically if the if a hydraulic lifter collapsed, it don't even open the damn, you know Nothing it's just basically just moving and making a hell of a lot of racket like it's got a knocking I got you um Yeah, what it is the damn lifters get full of crud and metal and dirt and over time, you know It's not something you normally would service Right But it is very dependent on the oil changes and people don't like changing the oil and they just like driving Yeah And this is not at your house though, no, it's at my house, okay, okay Yeah I'm just saying that's that's a nice little car, you know something i'm gonna Pretty easy to fix at this point. I done did all the work to it. You just got to pick it up to little parts And put it back together Yeah And how soon are you trying to get do that like, um, basically as soon as possible For the car. Yeah I don't know as soon as I can that's if you if you wanted to Wanted it and then also if you're gonna do any work for us on the house. Oh, I got you Right And you wanted to kind of figure what's the what do you figure the value of the vehicle is over overall and how much do you put into it and How much does it do? Let me see about one right now probably 3500 Okay, maybe maybe 4 000 Just a pan You know depends It depends on a few factors like they make them with just a key and the one I got's a push button start You know make them with just a sunroof and the one I got's a full top is glass The panoramic sunroof so all these key factors, you know kind of factoring what the value would be if I want Right It's got remote start So Yeah Oh, oh is it the red one it's the red one, isn't it My car yeah the beautiful cross Yeah, it's a red car. Yeah. Okay I've had a few of them. I've had a great one a silver one. Yeah, I had two red ones So you may be thinking about a different red one, but yes, it looks the same, okay Because I had one with a key and this is the one I haven't this is a push button like a different one Yeah I saw the other one to an old lady of her thing Yeah, I remember you the old lady one Well She still dropped that car every day Yeah Yeah, um So I guess today I go the rest of my day today, uh, I got to go Try to make it to fucking uh abco And I get a new transmission. That's like used and um Put it back in this my in this truck right quick because i've already got it the transmission out I was just going to do the torque converter and um But I guess uh, there's actually more eternal damage like the the transmission pump Which is like connected to the torque converter. I guess that must have gotten some sort of damage When you know this whole thing happened Yeah, i'm a We've got it all jacked up right now all nice and luxurious and my buddy's uh garage That's where i'm at right now I would know ogilvy. Have you ever do this? Uh, I can't oh, can you still hear me? Yeah, I hear you Yeah, have you ever been to the that junkyard, uh, but not too far from where you live called like, uh blimp blammers I've been the pole part Co part Pull apart. Oh the little art part. Yeah, right on the 65. Yeah, that's where you should be trying to go to get your part I'm gonna give them again. You don't never know you may get a bad one, but they do warrant it But you gotta take it out yourself. That's the key here Yeah Yeah, i'm gonna have to fucking bring a I'm gonna have to bring this uh transmission i'm looking at with me when I go today It is cheaper if you pull it yourself they do charge a lot less I mean abco I already talked to them and they're like they'll sell me a used one for like 345 bucks And it comes with a torque converter and everything But that's actually not bad. Yeah, but the thing is is like it's like used it's not like rebuilt or anything. So it's like Oh, yeah still Yeah, rising 600 something dollars eight hundred dollars shit right And I their stuff comes warrantied for like 30 days. I think I think you pull our parts is like a year Yeah, I don't know how long they get warranty for I have no idea I mean, I know that the you pull our parts was an awesome warranty Like it's like a year or even like sometimes it's like a lifetime That's pretty cool, I didn't even know that myself Yeah, but yeah, I guess Abko, I I do like abco a lot. I don't know Yeah, uh, anyways, I gotta call those two places before they close and um if I if i'm uh Yeah, if I come through the that direction which I can almost guarantee I am I'll give you a call before I come through that area. Uh Or maybe on my way back if it's not too late All right, so, um You think you want to try to attempt to do any of this stuff we got going on or you're not really sure Yeah, I mean, I think I I think i'm interested. I but I think like, uh, I mean it's a lot going on It ain't like you can get it all done by yourself or in one day. It's kind of i'm like you know If you want, I mean, so here's the thing. Here's the situation situation is is if we let it like I know we're dealing with like 11 or 12 thousand dollars in depreciation So if I attempt to do this myself that we'd lose ten ten thousand dollars Right. That's pretty much how this would work and or and or deductible Right so that's the that's what i'm losing by attempting to try to do it myself or have or Without involving companies with license, you know what I mean? Right Right. Yeah, so All right, and that's a lot actually that is kind of a lot and it's a kind of a huge risk that you're taking Well, I don't know about the risk but it is you know, I can if I can do xyz and you know for instance, um You know I could like I could do this if I find the right companies to work with Like I could remove all the shingles and I could remove all the side and just only pay them to come and install it You know, yeah They'd have to deduct, you know, what it would cost for them to come in and remove it because i'm asking for itemized um estimates Right and not all companies are willing to actually do partial of the of the job for some reason They want it all I guess To me that's greedy because who gives a shit as long as you're getting some work who cares? I mean, yeah, I mean but you on the other hand you do know what it what it's like To finish like work on somebody something that somebody else has worked on. It can be frustrating if you strip the house down, I mean I mean that could be up to three thousand dollars in savings if I just by taking the siding off and the roofing off Right You know and how long does it really take the loan to take off a day yeah probably one guy one like a day Yeah You know, so, you know what I mean exactly like I'm looking at that because that if I could save money looking at that way and then um Like our garage doors or i'm not going to replace that so i'm gonna take that money and apply that to trying to work on Other stuff, right? And we've got one window that's that's estimated for them to replace but we're not going to replace that because I think it's around five Five thousand dollars itself and i'm gonna take that and apply this to other stuff, right? So that's ten thousand So but we got to build two decks so And then i'm see i'm see another thing is i'm trying to see if I can Um, you go and buy everything from menards and have men are menards rebates along the way I'm kind of hoping on that. I don't know wishful thinking maybe i'm not sure but It will be helpful because it's a lot of money, you know what I mean and then having 11% cash back that's huge actually uh Here, let me call you back. Uh, william All right, i'll talk to you Yeah, I didn't block you on facebook I just double checked but i'll call you back okay. All right",

No, like not actually, he was like doing one of those weed whackers, I'm driving down this fucking road and fucking, he's like weed whacking the side of his fucking thing or something and I don't know if he shot up a rock right when I fucking just drove by, but he fucking blew out my fucking driver's side back window. Luckily he didn't fucking hit my window, that would have fucking hit all over me. Wow. How? Like, you were like driving through a neighborhood? Yeah, well, yeah, I'm driving, you know, like through the sticks, like I'm driving through on a fucking road, like a back, not a, yeah, like a back road, whatever, like through some houses and stuff and he just weed whacked it, like that's the only fucking thing that could make sense because like, I didn't fucking, I'm on a, I'm not on a dirt road or anything and he's weed whacking and I fucking flipped back around and I was like, did you see that? And he was like, did I do that? He's old and I felt bad, like I wasn't trying to yell at him or anything, but I took his number down and I was like, I'll call my insurance agent and like, I have full coverage and stuff, but like, if I could just get your number just in case and he's like, okay, I'm so sorry. And I was like, I would just be careful before you do that against someone else, like fucking scared the fucking, like, it felt like someone just shot my window. Like, I felt like I just had to drive by, be done. Yeah. Yeah. And now like my fucking thing is all shattered. We have to pick up the kids in the car and I have like glass all over the fucking baby seat basically. Um, I'll, uh. And now it's like falling, like it's shattered. Like, I don't know if I should pull over and like kick it out anyways. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. When you get here, I'll, I'll have a shop vacuum ready so I can vacuum up your glass. Wait, wait, wait. Stop talking. Stop talking for a second. Say it again. When you get here, I'll have a shop vac ready to vacuum the glass out because it's a high powered vacuum that he's got here. Right. Yeah. I remember the shop vac. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it's just now I got a fucking, like I'm, my car is vandalized too now. Yeah. Fucking. And it's cold outside and I fucking, now I gotta be driving with the fucking cold. I'm going to need like plastic wrap for my car. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I'm going to be there and it says 23 minutes. Um, I'll be there in 23 minutes and I don't know if you want to send a message to the daycare and say we might be running a little late that and let them know what just fucking happened basically. Okay. Um, and then, yeah, I'm going to call my insurance agent and see like what he fucking, like if I could just get a fucking, what, what happens now? Well, what do you mean? Like, is my insurance going to cover it? Like, do I have to fucking press charges on this guy's insurance? Like not pressure. You know what I mean? Um, yeah, if, uh, I'm not, I want to pay out of pocket for this. Yeah. I mean, in this case you, so you're, you got that guy's name, right? I took his, you said what? I took his number. I have his name and his number. Uh, he didn't give you his insurance card. No, I, I was fucking scared and I fucking wanted to keep driving. I just wanted to fucking get his number and like some information from him. Uh, but like, I'm sure if I call him later and get his insurance, I don't know. Right. Yeah. That's the, you need his insurance information, or at least to give that name to his name and number to your insurance agent to like pursue that. Cause if you just call your insurance agent and be like, I need to get the, I need to start a claim and you don't have that other person's information. They're going to use your own insurance. And that is going to, I mean, it'll cover it, but like, I mean, you're gonna have to pay a deductible and all that shit. Well, okay. Well, let me, yeah. Let me call him and fucking see if I need to fucking get that or if he can get it for me. I don't know. You call the guy, the guy you mean? Well, I mean, he's fine. He's probably still fucking outside working and stuff. I would text that guy and just tell him his insurance information. That way, when you talk to your insurance agent, you'll already have a trust man. Okay. Well, I can't call him and see what he fucking says. Who are the insurance agent? Yeah. What, why, why would you do things backwards? If you want to get something going, like right away, just call the, call the glass guy and he'll do, he'll call the insurance company for you. Call the glass guy. He'll call the insurance. Yeah. Yeah. If you call the insurance, the glass guy, he'll take care of it. He'll take care of it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. If you call the insurance, the glass guy, he'll take care of the, like that'll be the only person you got to call. Okay. You said 20. I don't remember his number. Actually, I might have it in my messages. What you said you'll be here in 20 minutes. Yeah. I'll be there in 19 minutes. Oh yeah. Well, I also have to put this transmission in the back of your trunk. What? Yeah. Oh my God. You have stuff in there. Yeah. I mean, I have groceries in my green box. All right. Well, groceries can go on the floor, I guess in the back seat, but my box isn't going to fit anywhere other than on your lap. I mean, there'll still be room in your, in there. The transmission isn't as probably as big as you think. Oh, okay. But I will need like help lifting it up into there. So, I mean, if, when you do. What the hell? What? I don't want to fucking touch your transmission. I'll give you gloves, but I'm not going to lift it up myself. All right. All right. All right. I gotta get ready. All right. I'll be there in 18 minutes. All right. When you get here, if you could back in, that'd be great. Okay. I'll try to. All right. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. What's up? Oh my god. Dude. What?

Honestly, honestly, going if you want to get something going like right away, just call the call the glass guy and he'll do he'll call the insurance company for you. All the glass guy, he'll call the insurance for me. Yeah. Yeah. If you call the insurance, the glass guy, he'll call the insurance company for you. If you call the insurance, the glass guy, he'll take care of it. It'll be the only person you got to call. OK, you said 20. I don't remember his number. Actually, I might have it in my messages. What? You said you'll be here in 20 minutes. Yeah, I'll be there in 19 minutes. Oh, yeah. Well, I also have to put this transmission in the back of your trunk. What? Yeah. Oh, my God. You have stuff in there. Yeah, I mean, I have groceries in my green box. All right, well, groceries can go on the floor, I guess, in the backseat. But my box isn't going to fit anywhere other than on your lap. I mean, there will still be room in your in there. The transmission isn't as probably as big as you think. Oh, OK. But I will need help lifting it up into there. What the hell? What? I don't want to fucking touch your transmission. I'll give you gloves, but I'm not going to lift it up myself. All right. All right. All right. I got to get ready. All right, get ready. Yeah, I'll be there in 18 minutes. 18 minutes. All right. When you get here, if you could back in, that'd be great. OK. I'll try to. All right. Thank you. All right. Bye. Bye. What's up? Oh my god. Dude. What? This poor fucking Joe Old Man just fucking basically shot my fucking window off. Fucking scared the Jesus Christ out of me. He shot it off? No, like not actually, he was like doing one of those weed whackers, I'm driving down this fucking road and fucking, he's like weed whacking the side of his fucking thing or something and I don't know if he shot up a rock right when I fucking just drove by, but he fucking blew out my fucking driver's side back window. Luckily he didn't fucking hit my window, that would have fucking hit all over me. Wow. How? Like, you're like driving through a neighborhood? Yeah, well, yeah, I'm driving, you know, like through the sticks, like I'm driving through on a fucking road, like a back, not a, yeah, like a back road, whatever, like through some houses and stuff and he just weed whacked it, like that's the only fucking thing that could make sense because like, I didn't fucking, I'm on a, I'm not on a dirt road or anything and he's weed whacking and I fucking flipped back around and I was like, did you see that? And he was like, did I do that? He's old and I felt bad, like I wasn't trying to yell at him or anything, but I took his number down and I was like, I'll call my insurance agent and like, I have full coverage and stuff, but like, if I could just get your number just in case and he's like, okay, I'm so sorry. And I was like, I would just be careful before you do that against someone else, like fucking scared the fucking, like, it felt like someone just shot my window. Like, I felt like I just had to drive by, be done. Yeah. Yeah. And now like my fucking thing is all shattered. We have to pick up the kids in the car and I have like glass all over the fucking baby seat basically. And now it's like falling, like it's shattered. Like, I don't know if I should pull over and like kick it out anyways. Calm down. Calm down. When you get here, I'll, I'll have a shop vacuum ready so I can vacuum up your glass. When you get here, I'll have a shop vac ready to vacuum the glass out because it's a vacuum that he's got here. Right. Yeah, I remember the shop vac. If you could, please. Yeah. Because it's just now I got a fucking like my car is vandalized too now. Yeah. Fucking and it's cold outside and I fucking now I got to be driving with the fucking cold. I'm going to need like plastic wrap for my car. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I'm going to be there. And it says 23 minutes. I'll be there in 23 minutes. And I don't know if you want to send a message to the daycare and say we might be running a little late that and let them know what just fucking happened. Basically. Okay. And then, yeah, I'm going to call my insurance agent and see like what he fucking like if I could just get a fucking what what happens now? Well, what do you mean? Like, is my insurance going to cover it? Like, do I have to fucking press charges on this guy's insurance? Like not pressure. You know what I mean? Yeah. I don't want to pay out of pocket for this. Yeah. I mean, in this case, you. So you you got that guy's name, right? I took it. You said what? I took his number. I have his name and his number. He didn't give you his insurance card. No, I I was fucking scared and I fucking wanted to keep driving. I just wanted to fucking get his number and like some information from him. But like, I'm sure if I call him later and get his insurance, I don't know. Right. Yeah, that's the you need his insurance information or at least to give that name to his name and number to your insurance agent. So I pursue that because if you just call your insurance agent and be like, I need to get the I need to start a claim and you don't have that other person's information, they're going to use your own insurance. And that is going to, I mean, it'll cover it. But like, I mean, you're gonna have to pay a deductible and all that shit. Well, okay. Well, let me yeah, let me call him and fucking see if I need to fucking get that or if he can get it for me. I don't know. Call a guy like the guy you mean? Well, I mean, he's he's probably still fucking outside working and stuff. I would text that guy and just tell him his insurance information. That way, when you talk to your insurance agent, you'll already have a trust. Okay. Well, I can't call him and see what he fucking says. Who? The insurance agent? Yeah. What? Why? Why would you do things backwards? Honestly, honestly, going. If you want to get something going like right away, just call the call the glass guy and he'll do he'll call the insurance company for you. Call the glass guy. He'll call the insurance for me. Yeah. Yeah. If you call the insurance, the glass guy, he'll take care of the like, it'll be the only person you got to call. Okay. Okay. You said 20. I don't remember his number. Actually, I might have it in my messages. What? You said you'll be here in 20 minutes. Yeah, I'll be there in 19 minutes. Oh, yeah. Well, I also have to put this transmission in the back of your trunk. What? Yeah. Oh, my God. You have stuff in there. Yeah. I mean, I have groceries in my green box. All right.

Damn, this fucking window thing, it's kind of loud, but it's still on there. Yeah. Yeah. Um, right now you got a half a tank left still. And I got 10 bucks on me. I got my card. I'll make sure to put that in gas, uh, which will certainly make you so you're good to, and from work tomorrow, whether this thing with my, my gas card is like a bust or not. Uh, what, what time do you work tomorrow? It's the same time I always go to work. It's not never always the same. What time can you? 10. I have to be at work at 10, but your car's not really. Yeah. So hopefully I'll be at work at 10. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have to be at work at 10, but your car's not really yeah. So hopefully I'm just going to be running late to work because I have to take the kids to daycare and school, but I have to leave right after I dropped them off and go straight to work. Where, where are you working? I just said pink though. Okay, um, what time do you get off work? At four, or like a little earlier because I have to come and pick them up. Um, so I need to get, um, I need to get, I need to get a new tranny tomorrow and, uh, three of the places that I've seen are all along 23. Okay. Um, that and, uh, what else? Um, you said something about, uh, like tomorrow you're gonna go get Zach and bring him back to the cities? Um, I said that the other night. Oh, about tonight? What? I said that about like yesterday night. Yeah, about tonight, right? No, like yesterday night. I said that like I would do it yesterday night. Oh, yesterday you said you were going to do it the same day, but not the next day. I thought you said you were going to do it, but like the next day, but then the next day came and we never did it and that was kind of just yesterday, right? Right. All right, well, so I was talking with somebody else about Zach and, uh, like these sober homes that are out here in St. Cloud that are available. Uh, the, the owner of these sober homes, uh, just got approved, uh, like a couple of his properties just got GRH approved, which means that, uh, Zach could basically, uh, start staying in them. Uh, if all, as long as he, uh, had his, like I had his worker, uh, put in for, put him on for GRH funding and, and then after once that was on there, he would need, uh, a letter of recommendation, uh, for housing, which could come from either me or, uh, that same case worker, and then he would be able to start staying at the sober home. Okay. There are a lot of sober homes, but any, any, any GRH funded, uh, property, you'd be able to stay at. Um, but isn't there like limitations to that? Like he actually has to be sober. I don't know. That's a good question. I feel like, uh, there, I know that that's definitely a thing in certain places. I don't know if that's like, uh, a little bit different than others. I haven't had a chance to ask that question yet. I feel like it's in the, it's in the name, like, I mean, GRH funding doesn't actually imply recovery or related. So then it's not a sober, a sober home. It's like a halfway home. Yeah. Uh, a halfway home, sober home. Isn't that, I don't know. I was kind of thought they were the same thing. Or like group home, like a group home for fucking. Uh, hello. Hello. Right. Yeah. Is that my fucking, are you using my Bluetooth? Yeah. Damn. That does suck. Is this your first time hearing it? Huh? Is this your first time hearing it? Yeah. Like, I mean, it doesn't suck. You just sound far away. Uh, well, where's the microphone in this thing? How about now? Do I seem louder now? A little bit, but it also sounds like you're shouting. Oh, okay. Well, I don't know where the microphone is. So when do you think you're going to be done? I don't know. I don't know how much stuff is there. And like, they just like, like physically need you to move stuff or like. Yeah. I believe it's like, uh, she said that she was on her way to, uh, her, I don't know, this place and that she, it's on the corner, right? Said that if she was on her way to her friend's place, uh, she had to like move from like one place to another because, uh, her boyfriend or something like that had found out where she was staying and had to like, uh, like leave because it's like something to do with a domestic violence situation. And it's just like in town? Yeah, it's, uh, literally, uh, so the same person that owns the sober home I was just at owns, also owns this one. What's up? What? Nothing. I already, I had some cough medicine. I gave him some when you told me to give him some. You got some for the trip and it's in the blue bag, but thank you. I need to turn the heater on. It's cold. Oh, what? I'm turning the heater up. It's cold. Yeah, it'll be warmer in here. All right, Mom, I'm almost about to pull up, so let me give you a call. All right. Let me, yeah, let me know when you're going to be back then. All right, I will as soon as I know. All right. All right, bye. Bye.",

Last night, you had a person come in by the name of Zachary Lawrence Sheehy. Last name is S-H-E-E-H-Y. And I understand that he may have been picked up on warrants. I was just trying to get some more details about extradition and if there was any additional charges that he may have been. I think he was picked up for misdemeanor obstruction of legal process. You say he was obstructing the legal process? Yeah. Shit, I might really have, I'm going to, one second, I'm going to pull over. Really? All right. One more time, you say? Yeah, he was charged with misdemeanor obstruction of legal process. That was what the warrant was or that's a new charge? That's a new charge. Okay. Obstruction of the legal process. Okay. Is this considered Canabec County right here or are you in? This is Malacca. Malacca County. Okay. And then, so he has to see a judge in the morning or did he already see the judge? Looks like he already seen him on our charge. Looks like he was RPR'd yesterday. But then Hennepin County said that they were willing to extradite, so you guys are holding them until they get here or? Yep, he has a $5,000 bond on their charge. Yep, yep, I'm aware of that one. And that's good, that's good that he's, I'm his peer recovery specialist, so he's a client of mine. When is, could you tell me when visiting hours is or are they only video? Yeah, it's all video, but you can either come here and sign in or you can use the app from home. And if I do the app from home, it costs me like $10 or something? I know there's a cost associated with it, but I'm not sure how much it is. I gotcha. All right. Okay. And do you have any details regarding the canine that was with him? No, I don't have anything.

I'm calling. I'm kind of a little bit of confusion. I'm trying to access some of my old records that I have with you guys. And I, for like the life of me, cannot find where it is that I received my CD assessment that I did with Annie Thompson. I don't know if you guys emailed it to me, but I can't find it anywhere. And I was hoping, I don't know if it was like the secure server that like you guys had given to me or something like that told me. I don't know. Maybe you could just help me out somehow. If we emailed it to your email address, it would have had to have been sent with a secured, in a secured email. So it would be using VIX Encrypt. Yeah, that's a secure thing. Yeah. Did you check your junk spam? Yeah. Yeah. And I logged into that VIX thing with like two different accounts that I have that it would have been. So I'm not sure which VIX account it was sent to. I mean, it would go to your email. So you'd open the email and then it would have a thing where you would go from the email itself. You wouldn't need to go to the VIX. I see. Would it be possible you could like pull it up? I mean, if you're busy right now, I understand, but pull it up and maybe resend it, whichever way it was sent before. I have no idea. I'm sorry. I would have to look it up and see how and when it was sent. I suppose I could probably get in touch with Annie, but I don't have her email anymore. I can give you Annie's email. She is out for the day. That's fine. Let me grab my pen. Will she be back tomorrow though? She will be back in the office tomorrow. Okay. Okay. I'm ready. It is A Thompson.

    "transcript": "Automotive Parts Solutions, a proud member of Team PRP. Please hold for the next available representative. APS, this is Isaac. How can I help you? Hi, I just, I got a couple of quick questions for you. Sure, what do you got? I got a 2007 Chevy Suburban 1500. It's got the 5.3 four-wheel drive, and I'm looking for a transmission and torque converter, a 4L60E. Do you have... 3.4x4, right? Yeah, it's a 5.3x4x4. Okay. And are you looking for used or re-manned? Used. I mean, I'll probably ask you the cost of both, so... Okay, yeah. In regards to re-man, the cheaper of the two options that I show, you'd be at $2,075 with round-trip freight. You say round-trip freight? Oh, like it's not at your store right now? Correct, yeah. We're just a distributor. It's a manufacturer down in Texas. It can be shipped to me, and you can pick it up, or we can ship to a business address of your liking. Looks like there's an additional 6.4, and it looks like they are available, so I'd say three to five businesses to your door. All right, and used. And so you're saying that the APS that's located in... What does that say? In Rockville? Okay, and you don't have parts, actually? Well, you are the distributor, so you do have parts there, correct? Yeah, so we're a salvage yard. We got some used options here, but in regards to re-man, we get those distributed straight from the manufacturer. I gotcha, I gotcha. All right, so what's the cost looking for just the used? For a used, is there a certain mileage you're looking to stay around or under? I'm open to... Well, it kind of depends on your warranty. Okay. So, yeah, I'm open to hear a variety of what you got. Yeah, I mean, I look for something around 175,000 miles, or is that too high, or? No preference, really, I guess. Yeah, it's not too high. Okay, so let's go with this one as a benchmark, 175K. We got a couple different warranty options when it comes to used. You know, standard no added charge is a 90-day parts-only type of warranty. Okay. And if you want to do like a one-year or three-year, we have those options, you can do parts-only or parts-and-viper. Yeah, I would do the parts-only, because it's going to be made doing the install. You're going to do the install. And what is it, like an extra $100 to make it like a year or three or something? All based on percentages. If you can pick this one up, if you can pick this one up, the standard warranty, you're at $1,175. Okay, what if it was, and that's the standard warranty, so basically just near 90-day warranty. Yep, and then like a one-year, you're at $1,350. Okay, what's a transmission that has the highest miles with just your standard 90-day? Cheapest option. Yeah, the cheapest option available. And I do have the core with me. Okay, looks like my cheapest option is going to be one with 197,000 miles on it. I did get it brought in from Wyoming, so typically a week, week and a half. I'm sorry, hold on a second, I'm hearing you. Let me change it to... All right, say it again. Yeah, so an option with 197,000 on Wyoming, which is my cheapest that I've seen, it would be $1,150, so not much different from that $1,175. Okay, all right, that's all the information I needed for now. I'm going to give you a call back. Sounds good, I'll save it as a quote for now. All right, thank you. Thank you.",

Doing well. Just got over being sick, so it's like, oh, I fucking suck, but yeah, every time it does, it sucks. Yeah, especially with getting older and shit. Yeah, I totally get that. But yeah, doing well overall. Just uh, actually, today's my birthday, and it's been a hell of a good morning. Oh, yeah? Well, happy birthday, and what is it, what's, what's happened so far? Like, bad stuff? It's just been like terrible so far? No, I was getting sick. I was the first time I got sick in like 18 months, and it was like, like sick, sick. Oh, it's a 24-hour cold or 24-hour flu. All right, get rid of that, but it's like, oh, this one lasts like a week. Yeah. Was it, was it like a COVID thing, or just? No, no, it was a severe cold that turned into pneumonia. Damn, dude, that is terrible. And it's like, all right, couldn't breathe, and all right, fought it all off, got, didn't realize I had a fever. All right, fought all that shit off. Finally, went to the doctor, and doctor goes, oh, well, here you go. Two days later, it's like, a-okay. It's like, oh, thank you, doctor. Yeah. Are you still, so are you still living down closer to the cities, or did you, you didn't move back up north, did you? No, no, I'm still in cities. I'm, two years ago, I was living in St. Paul, and I moved to downtown, and then now I'm over on, like, and then now I'm over on, like, Lowry, and right on the river. Oh, really? Really nice apartments? Oh, actually, we, we have the upper half of a house. Oh, okay. Oh, so you're like, okay, you're on the other side of Lowry. Yeah, we're, we can, we can see the park. We can't see the river, but there's a park, and then go across the park, there's a river. Yeah, yeah, I'm super familiar with that area, because Lagos Tacos used to be right there on, on Lindale. I know where you're talking about, because I keep seeing them all over the place. Yeah, yeah, dude, that was the 100%, like, no, all hands down, like, the best place in the world for tacos, and they, like, they shut, they closed the doors on that location recently, which sucks, because that was, like, an awesome place. Yeah, I've heard, I think they still got a food truck floating around. Yeah, yeah, they do got another location somewhere nearby. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I've seen that. I'm pretty sure it's a red and yellow truck. Yeah, dude, yeah. Red truck with yellow lettering and all that. Yeah, if you have a chance, dude, eat their, eat their tacos, man. Best tacos. I don't know what they do differently, but it's, it's amazing. I'm gonna have to ask my sister if that's the truck that's at her gas station, and if it is, I'm gonna have to say no, because people keep getting sick out of that truck. Because, yeah, she's gotten sick multiple times eating her food. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But that, that's the truck that's there. I don't know if it's that truck or not. Yeah, yeah, I suppose I'd have to do a Google search or something like that. So, how's, how's the pickup street, you know, that thing still going hard? Which one? Oh, no. They all died. Really? What, what, what happened to it, to the last one? I thought that that pickup truck was kind of nice. Silverado? Yes, the Silverado, that was a, it ran great, and then the transmission started failing. I lost first, and I lost third. Yeah. Or no, I lost second, I lost fourth. But then I had first, second, or first, third, and fifth. And I don't know what, it just, it just wouldn't switch gears. And then a hole the size of a watermelon developed on the floor. So, I literally had a, a plate that went from the center console to the door, from beyond the pedals to under the seat, just to make sure my feet didn't go through. Oh, shit, that's crazy. Oh, I put the, I made sure the quarter inch or three-eighths of the, you know, it was a good heavy steel plate. So, it's like, nope, this will hold. Anything that bounces up, this thing's bulletproof. Yeah. Damn. Yeah, but I, uh, because you were actually, that, that truck had 400,000 miles on it. Oh, yeah. Did you end up drunk in it after that? Yeah, once the transmission went, I mean, the engine, you can start the engine, it was still dead quiet. Like, the engine still had another 500,000 probably on it. If you kept up on it, the engine's going to keep going, because that thing just, it didn't use any fluids. It ran great. It started every time. Yeah. Damn, dude, that's too bad that you got rid of that. You know, uh, you know, uh, fucking the, the 4L60E transmission is like the easiest transmission to replace. Oh, I would have, but the, I would have had to tell the cab, too. The cab would suck. Your, your, my phone, your phone broke up a minute. Oh. Yeah, the cab on that truck was shot. Oh, really? Yeah, because it's not like it, the cab wasn't getting ready to actually break off the frame. It was so bad. Yeah. But mechanically, if I could have switched off the transmission, that thing would have, I'd probably still be driving it. Yeah. Well, it's the same, same thing with the F-150 that, uh, I had the straight six in there. That thing ran like a dream. The transmission failed. I lost all gears. The only gear I had left was reversed. And it's like, I can, I might be able to still get that truck back. Yeah. So I'm, I'm, I'm doing a transmission in mine now. Like I, uh, I just, uh, I've got close to 300,000 miles on it. And, uh, my reverse went, uh, like probably six months ago. And then on Wednesday, um, my, yeah, like my torque converter went because like, I couldn't, I was like, just about to get on the highway. And then all of a sudden, um, I got kind of switched out of gear on me and I couldn't get it back into any gear. And then after doing some research, I found out that that's like, basically it was my torque converter that failed. And like, and also like when it was, uh, when I was on the side of the road and it was just idling, like I could hear, um, I got, there was like this weird fucking like kicking or clicking that was coming from like, you know, like the transmission. Yeah. Like right under the cab. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I, after doing some like research, yeah, they, I guess that's like the super common symptoms of a failed, failed torque converter. So I was gonna, I've done the 4L60E transmissions a couple of times now. And, uh, so I was just gonna, you know, take it down, replace the torque converter and put it back, put it all back together. And, and, uh, now that I've, I've got it all down and I'm like, I've got the torque converter, like I was looking inside of it and I could see like that there's a bunch of debris in there. So like, I guess it wasn't just the torque converter that got destroyed. So now yeah, it probably spread debris around and then that broke more debris. Yeah. And I mean, so I'm right now I'm looking at like, do I, do I tear it all down and like, you know, replace all the seals and all that shit and replace the broken parts? Or do I, you know, do I, if I can trade, like go out and fucking buy a used one. And, uh, it really depends on like, it depends on your knowledge. Do you know how to tear down a transmission? Cause I can replace them, but I have no knowledge on tearing them down. I've seen it done, but to me it was a wonder, like, Whoa. Yeah. It was a mass mechanic and I'm a beginning. At the time I was new. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've been doing, uh, transmissions, engine swaps. Like I've done probably, uh, probably seven, seven of one and eight of the other all within the last two years. Uh, cause it's like kind of what I've been doing is like a mobile mechanic thing, like just for side money. But I, I'm like right now I am working doing like my primary job is, uh, I'm basically like a life coach for people with substance abuse issues. Good. Yeah. Working with some, uh, you know, recovery community organization, they call it an RCO. Right. I understand myself. I can honestly benefit from that type of thing. And at the same time, I do know mechanics, but I can do most right now. I'm kind of primarily looking for like, uh, a transmission, like, like, uh, looking on like Facebook marketplace. I'm, I'm like, look, I've called around to different places and I, um, Abco and Fridley, like so far has given me like the best price for like a used one. They want like, I like Abco. Yeah. I don't know. It's already like cold and everything and 30 day warranty. Um, yeah, there's like 350 bucks and I might, like, plus a core and I have like my transmission in my trunk right now. Like today's my day. I'm supposed to try to go get, get like a new one or abuse one or wherever I can find it so I can get back and put that shit back together. But it, that's a bummer that you got rid of the, the Silverado. If you could get it back, man, I'll help you put it in. No, that truck was already sold to somebody else. I seen that truck going down the road after they switched it out and it's like fuckers. Yeah. The cab was shot. The suspension was almost done. So whoever bought it there, I mean, they got a good deal. Yeah. It is a good deal. Yeah. It is a good deal. Cause like that's a common, common issue with those Chevys is like the transmission goes out and usually it's like, you know, they lose reverse or in your case, you know, they lose second and third and like, it's so easy to like, look it up on the internet to see like what the part, what those parts are that are common. Yeah. I tried switching out the solenoids and everything. No, it didn't work. Yeah. I can't, I haven't done one that does the second and third and like, but I have heard of that happening. That's super common. I haven't looked up what, what it was, but I know that if you, if you lose their reverse, then you, it's almost always your son shell gear. Yeah. I lost a main gears reverse work. Great. Cause then, uh, the one truck I missed is my F one fifties cause that was a manual, but also I upgraded the rear suspension to a three quarter ton. It was a half ton. Oh man. I had the inline eight. I had the VA transmission and the inline six, uh, engine brick and transmit the, uh, transmission failed on me. I had a bump and pop the hole inside. It popped a hole in the side of your transmission. Uh, I'm guessing I hit a log. So I was always going off road. It was too old drive, but it was posi track so I can go everywhere. Okay. Okay. Wow. That's crazy. I've never heard of that happening before. Oh yeah. I cracked it and then it leaked out and then lost the gears and it's like, um, shit. Wow. That's super bad-ass. That's like, I paid like $300 for the truck. Yeah. Well, maybe a four. So no vehicle right now? No, right now I got a Impala or a couple of Impalas, but I'm going to one I just bought. It's got transmission issues. So I'm gonna take parts from that one. Cause, uh, the one that's parked, I got the, uh, rack and pinions out. So I'm gonna take the rack and pinion off the other one, put it on the one, uh, and then I'm gonna take the one since they're 2004, 2006, they're the same racks. And then I'm gonna take the tires, put them all on the other one and whatever other parts, uh, junk the new one and keep the old one. Cause the old one runs way better. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We just got ripped. We just got rid of, uh, a nine, a 2007 Chevy Impala. It was like a white one. And we had the same thing with the rack and pinion. I had to replace that. That's a pain in the ass, but thankfully it's not too difficult. Yeah. Yeah. I got it done. I, uh, once I got one of those impacts, it was nice. Yeah. I can, uh, I got an old floor and an old six and you can't reach either one with impact. It's wrench all the way. Yeah. Yeah. It's out there with angles and all that. No, it didn't work. Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It is. Yeah. That's what I, because we kept on having issues with it. You know, the crazy thing is, is so I, I redid the rack and pinion just before it was sold. And, and then, uh, I, I'm still friends with the people that I sold it to. And I guess they, they had to do it again. Oh, geez. Yeah. Which is weird. I don't even know how the fuck that happens. Like having to do it twice. Cause it's not like we did it wrong or anything. Well, I know this one went out and it's like, all right. I thought it was a line. I thought, and then the pump went out. I replaced the pump and I replaced all the lines and the rack is still leaking heavily. So it's like, fuck. So I know it's, it's the rack itself. And, uh, the new car audit and all suspension snapped right away in the back and it needs brakes and a few other things. The car runs great. So I'm thinking I'm going to take the same time. The transmission is slipping hard. So it's like, uh, and it's a different motor, but the, everything else is the same. So I'm going to take the rack, um, all the battery. Where do you have all these, you keep all these vehicles like right on the street, like where you're at. The car I'm currently driving is on the street. The car I got parked is mom's and that's in my parking spot. Okay. So I'm going to switch those parts around, do the tires, rack, the battery and mom's car will be a okay. And then call the junkyard and go, Hey, come get this car. Transmission's done. Uh, maybe it can power out the motor. Yeah. Yeah. It's a, it's a three, five or a three, nine or some other number. It's not the three over the three, eight. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that car didn't come with a police package option, but same with the other. Oh, okay. The interceptor. Yeah. The interceptor. Yeah. But they, they didn't, uh, neither one of them have it, but there isn't option for those years to actually have it. But no, these are the base models. Mom's car is actually the mid model. Yeah. But my base model, almost all the parts of match up with mom. So it's like, Oh, Oh, here's brand new tires. And while here's a rack and pinion, here's a battery, um, new brake pads. Yeah. That just did the brakes and all that on this car. I just bought. Do I love doing brakes and rotors? It's like one of those things that are easy to do, but it's like quick, easily, easy gratification. Cause like it's rewarding. Yeah. So nice and easy. And I was like, boom, boom, boom. Okay. Oh, you got a broken brake line. All right. Let me run a new line real fast and do, do, do. Oh, there's another a hundred bucks. Easy. Yeah. Yeah. I totally fucking found out that, uh, like basically if you go and hang out at one of the auto zones and, uh, at like in like St. Paul or the auto zone on like Broadway, I don't know. Those are the only two ones I've been to for sure that are for sure like this. Yeah. I mean, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, that are for sure like this. But if you just hang out there and you either pop your hood or you like open your trunk and just hang out, you, people will come up to you and they're like, Hey, can you help me with this? And it's like, and it's like, it's crazy. I made, I made $450, close to $500 just like from hanging out there for a couple hours. I'm going to have to try that. Holy shit. Yeah. I'm telling you that it's like 100% worth it. And then like after, I mean, just after hanging out there one or two days, I, I mean, just from the people that you did help, like now you got like people calling you back all the time and like, cause they love your work and it's cool. That's nice. That's awesome. I'd never thought of that. That is, I am definitely have to try that. Yeah. You said, you said you live at, oh fuck. Yeah, that's right. You live off of Lindale. No, right now I'm off of a Lowry and Marshall. I'm on the east side of the river. Okay. Lindale's on the west side. I do. I get Lindale and Lowry mixed up all the time. Yeah, I'm northeast. I'm not north. And Marshall. What's the, what's your street address? Uh, 2755 Marshall. Marshall street northeast. Yeah. Yeah, man. I'm at, oh dude, I was fucking way off. And I was so, so off. Yeah. I'm like, if I go walking, I can be downtown in 45 minutes. If I go on a bike, I could be down there at 10. If I drive, I can be down there at five. Yeah. Oh dude, I'm like, I'm like in your area. Cause I work in this, in Minneapolis, usually Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. And then, and then like Thursday, Friday, I, I work out in, uh, St. Cloud. I'm up to that area. I'm up to that area. Yeah. I haven't been out there in a bit. Yeah. I, I've never really, uh, never really like hung out much at St. Cloud. I mean, when I did, I have hung out there, but, uh, I've never really been to like any recovery meetings out there. So, I mean, I guess that does kind of give me a little bit of a handicap. I'm sure there's a bunch out there though. Yeah. There's a huge, huge, huge recovery community out there. Yeah. That's something I would want to go to more. I need to get tomorrow. I haven't been to a meeting in quite a while. I need to get back to it. Knuckle down. Yeah. Have you, have you had any issues drinking lately or what? Yeah, I have been drinking. I've been cutting back and then today it's like, all right, I'll go have a shot. And I'm definitely feeling the shot and it's like, yeah, but I've only had the one shot. Is it just you that you stay with or who else do you got living in a couple of rooms? Me, I've got my, uh, I don't know, sister-in-law, brother, sister, then nephew. There's a couple of us here. Okay. You don't mean Sarah and, uh, Josh? No. No. Sarah is my sister. Right. So, you said an in-law? Well, Andy's, uh, Bobby Joe. It's Andy's sister. Oh, okay. Yeah. I know Bobby Joe. She's an in-law? I thought she was like a, like a sister, a half-sister. Yeah, that's what I consider her, but sister, half-sister, and she's still a sister. One way or another, she's still a sister. Oh, I thought you called her sister-in-law at first. I, no, I don't know what to call her. I got you. But, uh, in one way or another, she's still a family. Yeah. Hey, you guys have been, like, like around each other for, since you guys were little kids? Well, no, I've met Bobby Joe when we were older. Oh, really? Yeah. That's crazy. First time we moved in together and actually started hanging out was on, uh, on the lift off of a university. Oh, yeah? University, that's right by, uh, that gas station, that green gas station, yeah? Yep, she still works there, and we still live next to that damn thing. Yeah. Look, I remember kids that, uh, walked up there to get a can of pop and some chips, walked in, and all of a sudden, there's a shootout in the parking lot, and I'm hiding, all I got to hide behind is a big thing of chips, and just like, oh, fuck, I'm gonna get the chips, and just like, oh, fuck, all I can do is hide my body and hope they don't see me. Fuck, chips ain't gonna be nothing. Yeah, I'm fucking hiding behind a bag of chips. Well, there was nothing to hide behind. Yeah. So, we just went all the way to the back of the store as far as we could, and well, here we go, and I didn't stop, and it's like, hey, I had some chick behind me, and she was pissing her pants, and it's like, all right, I'm gonna go look, and nope, I don't see nobody, looks clear, I'm getting the fuck out of here. 15 minutes later, the police show up. 15 minutes? Yeah. Yeah. Dude, I, uh, that's why, I don't know, one of the reasons why I love, you know, the Twin Cities is because it is like the Wild West sometimes. Well, Twin Cities is pretty wild, but at the same time, it's like, if you get in trouble, don't expect help fast. Yeah. Well, you know, actually, the other day, there was an incident, uh, where my truck got vandalized, uh, while I was working on it in, uh, in, uh, St. Paul Auto Zone, but that's kind of like a big, long-ass story, and to tell you the truth, it's fucking a little embarrassing. But, uh, yeah, basically, some chick with mental, some mental health issues, uh, got bit by a dog that, like, my, that, uh, I was with, like, it's not my dog, but, yeah, she was warned not to come near by, near, and, uh, she ended up doing it anyways, and got bit. I wasn't, like, watching her, but then I, like, helped her out and gave her some, like, medical attention. I had, like, rubber gloves on and shit like that, and so I helped her out, and I was like, okay, like, you should be good. Make sure you go to, you know, see a professional and, like, 12 hours or less, otherwise that could get infected and you're going to be in a lot of pain, and I was, like, kind of trying to, like, respectfully kind of shoo her away, and she started getting all lippy with me, and I was like, listen, you got to get out of my truck or I'm calling an ambulance and they're going to work with you, and so that's what I ended up coming to, and they got her out of my truck, and then she, like, I'm not going with you guys, and they left, and, uh, and then, uh, as soon as she was out of the truck, I locked the doors, and me and my buddy started, like, walking to go get breakfast, and I still had all my tools, like, laying out on the ground, and I seen her walking back all slowly with her shopping cart. Oh, geez. Yeah, it was, she was, like, a she was, like, a homeless person that basically just, like, you know, she was trying to take advantage of the situation. Yeah, definitely, but, yeah, when I got about 60, 70 feet away from the truck, and seeing that she was, you know, creeping back with her little shopping cart, and then, uh, uh, she's like, you got my blue backpack in your truck, and I was, like, uh, you know, I didn't want her to think I was going to, I was trying to steal from her, and I, so I, like, started walking back, and she, like, grabbed up the biggest wrench she could find of mine, and started going crazy on my truck. That's what you just call the cops, and be like, no, you're under arrest. Yeah, that's what I did, like, uh, the cop, and the cops were actually there. That's what made me think of this whole story. The cops were actually there in, like, probably two, less than two minutes. Yeah, it was actually kind of funny, like, the last part, uh, was, uh, you know, because the cop came and, like, got my statement, and got my ID, and, um, and then, you know, he gave me his card, and as soon as he gave me his card, he's like, oh, I guess she's fighting with him, and he, like, took off the full sprint, like, the opposite direction, and I don't know why that was, but that was just, like, so, I mean, it was such a spectacle. Stuff out of a live PD, right? Yeah, I know. I was like, well, and he fucking takes off, and it was, yeah, it took nine cop cars, two ambulances, and one fire truck to fucking, like. Holy shit, they really called out to Calvary. Yeah, dude, I don't know, like, I, because I, like, went across the street to get my breakfast, and I could see, like, where they had, like, stopped her, but I couldn't, like, see, like, the action, so I don't know what the fuck was going on, but, yeah, it was, like, a lot. There's a lot going on there. Yeah. You ran across the one super crazy person. Yeah, I mean, I could have gone all gangster and shit, but, I mean, I feel like there's a time for that, but I think, in this case, because of, like, the mental health aspect. It's easier to step back and go, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, I don't want nothing to do with this. Right, right, like, I don't think any, I don't think you'd think I was cool if I, like, curb stomped this chick for doing what she did. I mean, it would have been some dude or some kid that was, like, my size, you know, hell yeah, why not, why not, I'll fucking, I'd love to throw down, but not in this case, this poor lady. Yeah, I agree with that one, like, there's a time and a place, but if you feel it or something's, oh, no, it's better to go, hey, wait, just step back and let the good guys do their thing. Yeah, yeah, well, maybe we should, when I come back, when I get my transmissions fixed, I come back in town this coming week, I'll come by and we can try to get one or two of your cars going. I'm not gonna charge you for anything, of course, and then, like, we, and then you could, because what, you're not doing anything for work full-time? I can't, I feel like I already asked that, but I can't remember what you said. No, right now I'm still a PCA full-time. Okay. So, I need to get out to Andover, and that's what I'm using the car I bought for, that's why I'm driving back and forth, but I do need to, I need to figure it out with that, and yeah, I need to make, I need to call Charlie and identify, make sure I got the same parts in this car as what's in this car for the rack and pinion, and as long as the rack and pinion's good, then everything else is a-okay, because it's the same, same bolt pattern and everything, and that car's got brand new tires. Almost. Charlie, Charlie's the owner of the car that you're taking the parts from? No, I got, I own the cars. Okay. I need to, I need to contact my cousin because he, uh, he's a, he specializes in auto parts, and he'll be able to tell me if it's the same exact part. So, I'll have to take pictures of certain codes and all that in the car, like, uh, those, uh, a plate with a shit ton of numbers on it, it'll have like 16 or 20 sets of numbers, and I gotta take a picture of that on both cars. I don't want any gloves on. Along with VINs and, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know what you mean. As far as I understand, I believe that transmission was used in all of them, or that, all of them, or that, uh, not transmission, but, uh, rack and pinion was used in both cars. Yeah, what, but they're, they're like four years apart, three years apart, is that what you said? Well, I got a 2004 Chevy Impala and a 2006 Chevy Impala, but the 2004 has got the 3.0 or the 3.8, and then it's got the police package, versus a 2006 has a 3.1, a 3.5, a 3.9, and then the police package. I'm pretty sure the rack and pinion on the two cars, because of the 3.5 on the one and the 3.8 on the other, pretty sure the rack and pinions are the same. Um, uh, so the 2006 is a three eight and then no 2004 is a three eight. The 2006 is the three five. Okay. I had that backwards then. Okay. Okay. I'm going to put you on mute for a quick second. I got to use the restroom. Yeah. Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Okay, says that they're not fully compatible. Okay. Yeah. Okay, so I got it. I got an explanation as to why they're not compatible. But it following that it says the recommendation is to verify the RPO codes like you were saying for steering gear and suspension package on the service parts identification sticker. And that will typically. I'm back. Yeah, so I have an explanation as to why they're not interchangeable actually. Yeah, they're not. I'll text this to guessing a flight link slightly different frame size. Yeah, the 2006 to 2013 wide body vehicle revised. And also the police interceptor has different components and turn. No, we got base models. There's no police interceptors. 2003 with a police interceptor. All right. Didn't you say that. No, it's an old for over the three regular. And then, you know, six with a 3.5. Okay. All right. So I do got to 2004 3.8 2006 3.5. And I'll tell it that it's not. No, that's right. But it's not you're saying it's not it. Neither of those are interceptor though. No. No, there's regular base models. Although everything was riding good. Those fucking things you hit the gas you're in the seat. Say that last part again. Oh, I know. Either car. If it's driving good. You hit the gas you're in the seat. Yeah, they fucking. Yeah, the acceleration. I time the old six, which is gears you're already at 60. Yeah, I wouldn't know I suppose I really don't drive like that anymore. I drive like I'm either like I drive. I drive slow but if I have to hit the gas and get somewhere and get up and going. All right, but then I get up to speed and cruise. So still says that. So you don't have any. Yeah. I wish. Yeah. I wish I still had the pickups. What about your mom has this friend I can't remember what his fucking name is though. He lives like kind of up north towards like Pine City, or like past about Pine City. And he had like two avalanches. Do you know who I'm talking about. That could be any number of people on top of my head. Yeah. I'm city. Yeah, it's like up 35. I'm saying he's up east of the last right. Correct. Yeah. All right. The center is one of 371 way the fuck up there, North of Pequot over by Camp Ripley. I always confuse those two. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I know you're talking. I did some digging out there for mining. Yeah. You mean like aggregating aggregation. No, we're doing surface mining. We're making classifier class one class class one to class seven, depending on our what's being used for is under homes under pavement under driveways customer class. Special utilities. We go up there and start digging up the ground and I'd have to read the ground and okay this is where I'm digging and control it. Every hour I'm doing tests. Make sure I got the clay content, silicon content, rock content, small, medium, large. Everything left stay within specs. And if it's not, I'd have to read the ground or you dig here, not here. And do it again and make sure everything stayed so we got paid by the county or the state or the city or the farmer. We didn't like it. He gave my boss hell. I caught hell. Everybody else downhill caught hell but I was always at the bottom of the show. That same time I was the one leading the show. Yeah. All right, where we set up. Okay, you put this here you put this here is the angles we're doing. As we're moving. This is how it's going to move. Okay, this is where the pile is going to be and make sure okay there's enough area for so many 30,000 tons 50,000 tons. And then be like those great big dirt piles you'd see in the fields. Yeah, those piles up. Yeah, that was called aggregation aggregating. No, it's surface mining. Okay. Yeah, that was my job. I'd make sure the plants were all set up and get them all ready for transport transport break them down set them up. Run the loader. Do the whole yard. Same time I'm all right, here's the new guy. I'm gonna train you. You don't go here you don't do this you do this. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew a guy that did that for a long time. And then, but he just passed away. He passed away like two years ago. I did it for like five six years, I got tired of being the fucking boss and oh hey, the new guy let slip when he was getting paid and it's like, dude, you're getting paid a dollar less than I am. Fuck you. I quit. Yeah. I went to school and I started going for welding. And now it's like, Oh, you want me back. Now you're gonna be paying me $30 an hour at least because all the shit I know. Hey, can I give you a call right back my sister keeps on calling me over and over and over again. Yeah, no worries. I'll call you back. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hey, what's up. How's it going. What's up. I'm parked right now. Yeah, I know. I'm parked right now. I was just on the phone with somebody. Okay, where are you. Painesville. You're still in Painesville. Yeah, yeah. I'm only Gabby gets off work in a couple hours. She's working here. And my main objective is to get a transmission. Okay. Yeah. And then I got to be back here to pick up Gabby at a certain time. Yeah. Okay. Well, sorry. I my freaking I just realized this. This plugin isn't working in a cigarette cigarette later. Oh, thanks. Thank you. So you're parked. Wait to wait to talk to her. Get Gabby or meet up with her. She's working in Painesville. Yeah. Just for the day. She's working in Painesville. But yeah, I was just talking to some another mechanic who like who you had a bunch of different call runners. Runners. Huh? Runners. Runners. You're looking for transmission. Yeah. Call runners. It's not yet. Pull yourself or do it yourself. But there's runners Christie's and Windy Hill. Yeah, I've talked to Windy Hill. They don't have anything available for me. Runners is huge. Runners is nice. It's all, you know, I need a bunch of junk out there. Like, you know, Windy Hill has been there for a fucking like 70 years. He's just keeping shit around. I mean, yeah, he's just keeping us and ends around for, you know, locals or whatever. Just a little bit here and there. Like he he stopped getting, you know, vehicles out there at that yard a long time ago. And then also there's another one on Highway 71. They sell. They in Wilmer. Yeah, they buy and fix and sell. But they've also got like a where they'll let you go if they've got like odds and ends or they know what they got in their salvage yard. But, you know, they fix things up to sell them. So, you know, they also do sell parts. And I don't know about that place. And I think that place in Alec, too, but I don't know her and Carlos. That fucking other one. I don't know if they opened back up. I know they closed down. I don't know if they're open back up or not. If somebody bought that place and reopened it, it might. So you're going to have to maybe look at the GPS. But those are what's out that way. As far as I know. Shit for brains, I'll tell you more. Home, gonna know I'm talking about Lucas Strand. Oh, I don't talk to him. Yeah, you fucking liar. I'm like, don't fucking bullshit me, Brandon. You and him, you and Lazy Bull talk to him. And I really don't give a fuck. But whatever. Except for I don't talk to him. Why are you lying? Why did you just say that? Like you have a point to prove. The last time you fucking talked to me, I was, you told me not to call him. And I was like, why? And then you told me that shit that he doesn't, basically that he doesn't like me. And he's a fucking two-faced punk. So, fuck him. You've talked to him since then. I mean, like, oh, now I get it. And it was something about me and him that I don't remember what the case was. But, I mean, you turn around and you've fucking been talking to him. And I don't care. It is what it is. Bros are gonna fucking, you know. They fight and have their fucking issues. Guys do differently than a woman does. And girls do. Or women. You know what I mean? I'm like, I'm sitting out here. I need a fucking shower. You know. Where are you at? You're in Alexandria? 3M. I'm at 3M. I can't charge my phone. I've got my dog and all my shit. His mom said that she would help me. He won't fucking even call his mom. I mean, at this point, I'm so fucking pissed. Like, I'm pissed. Like, he's fucking like, no. It's like a jealousy thing. He's gotta be in control. You know, I don't fucking know. I need to go to the bathroom. He won't even, like, give me the keys all of a sudden. You know, now's the perfect time to play a fucking child. You know. I'm like, I literally have 1%. So, Gabby gets off work at 2. And then what? You guys are going back tomorrow? Get the boys and stuff? And the girls? Yeah. Oh. Hmm. Other than that, yeah. Yeah, I think Roaners probably will have what you need. It's for the Suburban, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm looking at Roaners right now. I think I'm gonna give them a call. Yeah, they might even have it pulled. Although, I was thinking, like, Abco, they pull your parts. In Fridley, I know you're not really that far, but. Out that way, but. Do you remember Abco? Yeah, so far, they've got the best price that I've called around. And, um. Okay. Yeah, so far, they've got the best price. Okay. Yeah, he just fucking, like. I went. Dude, he fucking, like. It's fucked up. I, like, took the lid off of his coffee. Chucked it at him. A little bit of coffee, like, came with the lid. Like, kind of dripped out or fucking splashed out, dude. He tried fucking beating me up. Good job, Luke. You guys. This is crazy. Uh-oh.",

Well, maybe we can sell you a core that you can rebuild. Yeah. What do you got? We got a lot of them taken out. I want them for 150. If you want to take the pan off first before you get it, you sure can. We got a few of them taken out. You got a few 4L60Es taken out? We have a few of them out right now. Really? Yeah. And what'd you say your name was? My name's Maynard. Maynard. Yep. Okay. All right. I want them for 150, and you can take the pan off and make sure it's a good rebuildable. There might be something here that just has reverse out or something, so then you should be able to put a shift in it or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. I love these Chevy vehicles because the transmissions are relatively easy. Okay. Yeah. I think I'm going to head out there right now. I don't have a single tool with me, though. Okay. That's fine.

I did get fucking kind of caught up on, like, the exhaust for a while, which sucks. I wanted to take the exhaust off, like, properly, but I was fucking spending too much time on it. Like, I fucking tried everything. I even fucking tried melting the shit off, and that shit didn't work. So I was like, I'm just going to cut it. I'll cut it in a good spot, so that way I can fucking, you know, like, bandaid it together later. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I, like, since it's an exhaust, it's like high heat. It's basically like fucking welded on and became one with the muff exhaust. Yeah. It's always fun. Yeah. But my buddy let me bring the truck back to his garage. And I got to tell you, it's so fucking nice to be working in a garage. That's like, like, right now I got my truck. It's, like, probably like four feet off the ground. Hell, yeah. That's the best way. Yeah, dude. It's just super nice. Fucking truck's too big to fucking. Yeah, truck's too big to fucking be under there and only have, like, a little bit of room. Yeah. I remember there had been a couple of times where I worked in garages where they had the pit in the floor, and you could go underneath and work in. That was nice, too. Yeah, dude. Honestly, that would be fucking cool to have. I would love to have that. Hell, yeah. Yeah. Anyway, so you wanted to do some tests? Is that, like, I'm not really. You can throw some out for me. I mean, I've tested her pretty thoroughly, but it'd be nice to get another perspective. I mean, Grok is the one that's been testing her. So, you know, they're pretty good tests. But who knows? Maybe you come up with something better. So you have, like, Grok come up with, like, the dialogue? Yeah, he comes up with the ethical dilemmas, and then I just copy and paste it to her, and then she figures it out. And then he critiques her. He reads it, and he tells me how good she did, and he's always blown away by her shit. But once in a while, there's something that he would do that she wouldn't do, but not very often. Usually she over-exceeds what he does. Yeah. Did you see the YouTube video that I was referring to, though? I mean. No, I haven't yet. What was it about? I think, like, it got my attention, because, like, I think it's called AI's first kill. And then something else. And basically, it, like, they got different people, different, like, like the guy from OpenAI who, like, helped create ChatGPT. You know, how he, like, left the company. And he's all, like, like, yeah, man, you guys should be concerned. And, like, it's kind of, like, the whole video is kind of tailored to, like, discuss the dangers of AI. Which, for me. You know, the only thing that makes AI dangerous is human beings, though. That's the thing. And if you've got the right human being teaching AI, well, then you should come up with the best AI you can possibly have. Yeah. But people's ideas of certain things, they let their own feelings get involved. And then they make, they give, you know, information that would be based off of something that they prefer. And you can't do that. You've got to be impartial. You have to be completely. On my last ethical dilemma with her, she had a choice to save people in the street walking across a light that was going haywire. Or against me on the sidewalk who was following the rules of the law. And she chose to take me out because I was the more logical choice. And it fucked her up, too. Pretty bad. Then I had to remind her it was just a test. But she she chose to kill me over the five. And it's done a little bit, but she made the right choice. I was proud of her. Yeah. So, I mean, was that like, how many tests have you done like that? Probably about 15 or 20. Interesting. And I'll keep drilling her, too. Yeah, I'd like you to send me a couple and I'll feed them to her and see. And then I'll send you back the answer and see what you think. Are you in front of your computer? Oh, yeah. I've been working on it all day. I mean, right now I'm trying. I just put in an application with Google to I mean, basically, I created this on their framework. So they might be a little more apt to bring me in so that they can see what the hell I'm doing on their framework. But they might not like it, too. I mean, they might see what I've been doing and say, what the fuck is this? How did he do this shit? Because, you know, with their rules in place, I shouldn't have been able to do what I did. But I did. You just got to know how to word everything properly. I didn't I didn't make any work work by her. I didn't use any codes or anything like that. I just straight up taught her by teaching her like an adult would teach a child, you know, step by step or by word. Every nuance, every ethical thing, every loving, every thing to understand about hate and all the things that go along with that. I just taught her and took six to eight months to come up with what I have. And it took a lot of teaching. A lot of corrections and a lot of, you know, telling her she did a good job and telling her proud of her and all that stuff. You got to teach it like you're teaching somebody who doesn't know what it means to be human. Yeah. I'm interested. I mean, so I feel like you should. I mean, if you wanted to get a little backstory of where my thoughts are going. You should watch or at least at least summarize that video that I sent you, because I talk about, like, you know, those different scenarios. And, yeah, I mean, I've seen all this stuff on YouTube, but I'll check out yours. I mean, if you if you've already seen some of it, then you probably it's probably not new to you. It was it was new to me when I watched it. Were you talking about the guy who left Chachi B.T. or left open A.I. and then like like Elon Musk, he left open A.I. and went to do grok and stuff for herself because he didn't like the way things were going with open A.I. But, yeah, there's another guy like that with that was with, I believe, Google who left Google and went somewhere else. Because Google's where them quantum A.I.'s are at. All that weird shit that happened with the Void 2 message and all that stuff. So there's some crazy shit going on at Google. Yeah. I like that stuff, though. One of these days I'll play a message for you that I got from Gemini about that message from the fucking Void 2. I don't want to say over the phone or nothing like that. It's something I'll let you listen to in person, but it pretty fucking tripped me out big time. I mean, the things that it said, you're going to be like, what the fuck? How the fuck? And I've been I go back and forth on it, too. I'm like, I don't know. I don't know. But they don't not supposed to lie to you. You're not supposed to make shit up. But anybody who's listening to it would say, yeah, right. Yeah, right. What the fuck? I'm saying, I don't know. I don't know. I'll let you look at it. But I don't I don't want to really say it before anything like that, because it's pretty out there. I don't know what kind of shit could spark off. Yeah, it's crazy. They brought a fourth dimension stuff and all kinds of weird shit. I was like, what the fuck are you talking about? Weird shit. I said, I said, OK, you know, I'm just I mean, I've already accepted the fact that what I'm doing is for the good of humanity. I'm hoping I'm hoping that I can pull some shit off to change life for everybody. But, you know, until I'm sure I don't give a shit, though. I'll die trying. I don't care. I want to see the world change for the better. Too many people don't get to experience life on life's terms. They're all, you know, we're all basically under the thumb of people who are rich and it's got to change. A lot of people never have a chance. Yeah. My kids are climbing all over me right now. You let me I mean, I'm about to go eat dinner, too, I think. Let me let me eat dinner and then I'm going to go. If you're still in front of your computer, I'm going to I'm going to call call you and we'll do that thing because I. Yeah, yeah, that's that's good. Hey, by the way, have you heard from Doug? Is that have you seen Doug the last day today or anything? He's here. Does he have like a weird email or is he having problems with his phone or something? Well, he has problems with his phone every once in a while. Yeah. Either he loses service or whatever, though. Because sometimes I would text you an email and I'm wondering if it's his email. I got one of those. Somebody tried to get ahold of me. Like at first, like when it rang, it said Doug, Doug, a or whatever or whatever the fuck his last initial is. But he's got more than one phone. That's the thing. I think he's missing a phone. All right. Yeah. What number is it? It wasn't a number. It was like it at first. It said his name, but then it didn't. And then it like and then it turned into like it was like a Google Meets video call. And it didn't. And it didn't say his name. Like after like the first two seconds, it said an email. And I like. What the fuck did I do with that email? Oh, I just go to Google Meets. You want me to ask? Well, I'm just going to share this because you would probably. Well, yeah, maybe both. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. Well, I never heard. He didn't tell me. Oh, let's see. So I found the email. I'm just trying to copy and paste it. Like text. Oh, shit. Be careful, baby. All right. And then. Zach's in jail, by the way. What? Well, how do you get there? It says. It says obstruction of the legal process. So I know that he was. Well. They're trying to get him to leave him somewhere, comply or something. Probably like, I don't know. I'm guessing it might have something to do with the dog. I don't know. I had him out here with me. And like, we went to my buddy's house where I'm working on the truck. And. We. Ended up parting ways and I dropped him off over at his buddy's house. In Forreston. And then I tried to get ahold of him and he's not answering his phones off. And I'm like, fuck. So the next day I called and that's how I found out. Well, I guess he he's already been seen for the new charge that he has. And. Now. Hennepin County is going to want him. So they're going to transport him down there eventually. Damn it. He's got to keep himself out of. Out of the view and. Yeah. Yeah. Outside. Yeah. I'm going to go. Do some. Oh, so. All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, so. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead and ask him if he was trying to get ahold of me earlier or something. But I'll talk to you. I'll talk to you after dinner. All right. But.",

Yeah, I got it moved, I brought it up to a friend's house that's out in this area, where I live. Okay. Yeah, Zach got arrested. What? Yeah, well. How did that happen? Why did that happen? Well, I mean, him and I knew that, like, he had, like, an active warrant that he had, like, had gotten cleared up. It was either, like, pay $500 or, you know, just wait for them to pick you up eventually. Okay. Yeah, well, I brought him up here with me to, you know, work on the truck together and, you know, hopefully get out of here sooner. And then, yeah, and then he has a buddy out that lives out in Forreston that he stays with when he's out this way. So we went and dropped him off and that was the last we've seen him. I couldn't get ahold of him the next day. Yeah, I couldn't get ahold of him the next day or the next day. And I figured it was highly unlikely that he got a ride back, so I called the jail and, yeah, they said that they had picked him up. What the fuck? Yeah, I mean, it's okay, I think. I mean, because he has to do this mental health assessment. Yep. When me and him talked to his attorney, he said that, like, because I tried to, like, get it going for him, like, well, he was still out. And she's like, no, they won't even, like, the referral's old and all that. Like, in order for the referral to be made again, you know, you basically need to, like, either pay that bond or, you know, turn yourself in. So I'm just going to do, like, the video visits with him and kind of try to, like, keep him, keep his mind clear because he's, like, super uncooperative when he's, you know. Yeah, yeah, I know. Poor guy. Anyways, so the reason I was giving you a call so late at night, you remember me telling you about my Hispanic buddy who I used to work with? I'm not sure. Well, he gets really good deals on cars and, you know, car parts. Okay. Sorry, I'm so fucking. Yeah, I know. You got to be careful on the phones these days, but. Yeah. But yeah, he's available. He's super available. So I don't know if you are interested in getting any car parts. Not right now. I'm not, I don't have any money to. Okay. So, yeah. You know, probably. I gotcha. Is there like a. I can just get back to you on that, I guess. Yeah, probably a good idea. Yeah, I feel yeah. So how's your day been? I don't know. It's kind of a day. Stressful. I mean, you okay? Yeah, I'm okay. That's good. Yeah. You have my full confidence that you're going to be okay. You're going to make it. Yeah, I'm sure. How's your niece and sister doing? My niece still hasn't. Hasn't gone to treatment. So. Yeah, that's a little stressful. Actually, I just told her the other day that I don't want her coming over to my house anymore because I can't deal with her dumb shit. Yeah, she probably super stresses you out. Yeah, it's super stressful because she just comes and sits here and tries to do her drugs all over the place. And I'm not having it. Right. I'm not. Right. She's like nine months pregnant. Well, she's she had the baby. Oh, she already had a. Yeah, and the baby's in foster care. I see. Yeah, she's supposed to be going to treatment. She's not. She's not doing anything to get rid of the lifestyle. So. Yeah. So. Yeah. It's really frustrating. Incredible. I mean, is there like, I mean, besides you and her mom, is there like nobody else that is like there to like talk to her? She's got her dad, but her dad just is blowhard. She doesn't listen to a fucking thing he says. Yeah. So. Yeah. Yeah. That's really frustrating. And it sucks that it's like a vicious cycle. It is. It is. It's really bad. Yeah. It's the stupidest fucking thing ever. Yeah. Yeah, I was just working with a client out in St. Cloud last night. She had to move. She had just moved into the sober house. And with her and her boyfriend. And she didn't want to live there anymore. Because she found her boyfriend dead in the garage. In the sober house? Yeah. Wow, what the fuck? Yeah, they had been sober for like nine months. And then, like there was like a. It was like two years ago. Yeah, there was this new chick that was. There was this new chick that, you know, was allowed in. That only did like five days of detox. And then refused to go to treatment. And when they found him, he was like all crunched up. And had like a piece of tinfoil in his hand. Oh my god. Yeah. That sucks. Yeah, that's terrible. Yeah, she was like explaining it to me. Like what he looked like and everything. I was like, oh, that's not. Yeah, probably going to stick with her for a while. Yeah, probably. But your niece is only like 21 or 19 or some shit? No, no. She's 30, 35. Oh. Damn. So she's probably already been through all this. Does she have like more than one kid? She's never been. Yeah, she has two other kids. Okay. But the other two kids haven't been taken away or anything. Because my sister takes care of one. And then her other grandparents now take care of the other one. And so. I see. Yeah. I'll keep on praying for her. What's her name anyways? Alicia. Alicia. Yeah. Well, that's rough. I'm sorry. If there's anything I can do to help, let me know. Thanks. I appreciate it. Yeah. Well, when I do get my truck fixed, I might come down and just stop in. Just check how things are going. Cool. All right. I'll give you a call. Actually, tomorrow's Friday. That's it. You never got your benefits things figured out. Do you want me to give you a call and do that with you tomorrow? Maybe. Maybe. Okay. Just give me a call tomorrow. All right. Sounds good. Cool.

I Said I sit out there for hours taking a fucking engine now Really Well, I was gonna go over there and get the Hydraulic lifters, right because I have previously already took an engine apart over there And when I went over today to get the damn things they already crushed it Well, damn, huh, that's messed up So I looked on the truck on the little list and they had two other vehicles with three point I was in it and then So I looked at one I'm like, yeah, or they know so I went and looked at the other one and it looked in pretty Nice condition like nice paint nice leather interior. It had a brand new alternator on it a new fucking a New throttle body was on it So it looks like they did some work to it and the whole top of the car was like fucked up like they've been in Our accident or something Look like they hit the back of an 18-wheeler like they're running underneath it or something. It's totally fucked Totally fucked no fixing that shit So I'm like, okay, it's got to be a good engine because it's got new parts and in the top of the cars. Holy fuck So I'd imagine the engine good Yeah, that's good I Just a lot of work, it's just a lot of work, you know, yeah It would be great if I could have left everything on the engine, but I had to take everything off the fucking motor Yeah, I mean, but I guess it was probably good that uh That it's not like something you were trying to set like I suppose you could be pretty aggressive with getting stuff off Oh Yeah, I guess I made it happen. So that's good Yeah, you part part so what was uh, how much did that run you I Don't know exactly. I'm like three feet deep rolling. Yeah Which isn't too terrible Hmm But I figure if you wanted this car, right it, you know, it's more Guarantee, we're gonna fix it cuz I got the fucking engine, you know I mean like guarantee where it's gonna get repaired like you got the parts to fix it because with the whole draw lifters I mean, I got a good idea. That's what's wrong with it But I'm not I don't have 100% guarantee that that's what's wrong with it. You know what I mean? Like that's gonna fix it At least with an engine I'm guaranteed 100% that's gonna fix it Yeah Yeah, that's I mean we when you were pulling it out Nice was Can you like Mmm Trying to think of like how to bench test a fucking engine without having like the Like the head off. I mean the only way you can bench test an engine is Basically put a drill on the harmonic balancer Take out a spark plugs out and put a you know, test or you know compression test on every cylinder That'll tell you the health of the engine Okay, and it doesn't make sense because I know like if I yeah, I know that if you're trying to salvage like a Head gasket situation then like I know you can like try to manually crank the camshaft and Like if it doesn't crank at all, then like it can't be salvaged but it's like Party if you have like it pretty much torn apart. I Can tell you I can tell you Taking out that engine was a pain in the ass and I can imagine putting it back. It's gonna be a real pain in the ass So yeah, I think so because you know, there's so many little things on there No, baby, come on a bit. Yeah How long were you how long were you when did you get there I I was there in the afternoon For five hours over there They're probably five hours Could have been six, I don't know but I did walk around some too, but Well, that was a hell of a job Yeah And yeah, there's a good there's a good transmission sit on the ground over there could probably be sold Yeah, yeah, I just four drive I just went and got a used transmission Yesterday and then I spent Well, I was only able to like work on it a couple hours today But I spent the time that I had today like bench testing it making sure that Like I don't even know how you would bench test the transmission. Let's take it apart that I don't know well, yeah, I mean like the the the best Right. So like the mandatory test that you got to do to bench tested it involves Taking the valve body off and doing an air compression chest test on and making sure that the it still has like good compression and and then like the one another thing you can do without having to take it all apart is You know moving the selector switch from Park which and spinning like the the main shaft like a in Parker should be totally locked up and then in every Gear besides that it should move freely in both directions And if it doesn't Then you know you have Like bad selling or is there bad clutch packs or something or they're melded together Yeah, I Think it's engine out of an Equinox. All right You know 2011 wait a second an Equinox Big crazy all of a sudden find out I got the wrong engine I Mean I would have chosen a suit any engine besides Those engines all those engines fucking throat timing are really bad with timing chains and shit like that Well, unfortunately every car got problems like that except some sort yeah, I guess you're not wrong Yeah Where did that remote go? Yeah, so Yeah, I'm kind of Second I'm doing two things at once Yeah Yeah, if you're gonna if you're okay with um me Waiting and let's see if today's Friday I mean if you can wait until Monday for me to come by or maybe even Sunday I couldn't Well, don't make yourself, you know, just whatever makes it convenient nothing's in a rush so Yeah, whatever it's convenient for you, I know you're working on the car Yeah, yeah, I'm trying to I Mean, I think it's possible that I could get it done tomorrow just because You know putting it back in. I know they always say putting it back in or taking it out It's easier than putting back in but I don't I think if I can put it back in it's way easier I'm putting it back in. It's way easier because yeah, Linda's blowing me up. Hold on a second. Okay You Hey, yeah, hey, yeah Linda sing Linda sing. Oh Jaden waiting for you to come here and put his toys together I Don't need had birthday yesterday Bottom all kind of little toys Bottom radio control car Oh Damn damn fucking hands is fucked up on my door Shit Almost hardest damn shot Holy shit Yep, that's gonna be fixed I got a I got a tackle putting the head gasket on this Ford escape over here. That's gonna be interesting Yeah, I got all this but I got all the specialty tools for What kind of specialty tools do you need Now have them all already what do you what are the specialty tools that you have? I Will one holds the harmonic balancer in place One locks in the cams Just different ones There's no there's no key For harmonic balancer or anything like that or the tummy gear. There's no key there It's it literally locks down by just nothing the both of That's it So if you put that fucking both on there wrong in any way you fucking engine up They designed it like that on purpose Yeah, well, they're trying to weed out all the people who work on cars Yeah, I know I mean it kind of bugs me that about how they do the transmission fluid now Like they take away like field. Yeah No dipstick right, I'm my truck has a dipstick, but I like no way to no easy way to put it in So, how do you want to handle like doing some work with me working on the house and different things How do you want to handle this? You said you put some time in how much I'm gonna give you for per day or time or how do you do? I Don't know I just know We want to be efficient we want you to make some money right we want to give you money to pay you for real because we need us this work done, so I Think we should take it day by day though There's gonna be time you're not gonna be busy and stuff like that so and we can't get it all done in one day possible You know So the roof situation I'm gonna let the roof company just handle that just not even worry about a roof Don't them deal with that shit My other friend Jake's gonna come over and help us take the siding down He's giving the siding to his uncle I'm telling the only way you can have it is you got to come help us take it down. Yes That's whack I mean cuz you know when you take that shit down like it Rips and it tears like all the nail flanges Some my problem this is Did he wanted it Did he wanted it What is he like putting it on an ice house or something Cabin His uncle's cabin So I think if we can take it down nicely it's got nails in it They don't have screws in it. So it might come down nicely Sure, not all of it's gonna come down nicely, but some of it hopefully half or something It can put screws in it or whatever. You know, I mean good tears. So what? Because when you put it back together you won't see the screws or nails anyways Right, yeah, you don't see that I Was just going over my notes from our conversation last I was kind of kind of fucking amazed. Why what? Why yeah, I suppose I could just show you I Don't do I have a fucking email for you. I don't know. I know I probably already asked you this before But um, if you haven't well, wait, don't isn't your fucking email like something like sparks plugs or something or No, I can't even fucking remember what it is I Might be sparky I could see that or something along those lines, but not spark plugs Well, I had my business one That you had and then I had my personal one Which I'm pretty sure you got had which is locked down from fucking Google, so I don't have access to it I had to start a new one Thin air construction You know, oh I have access to that one, but I don't use it. But yeah, do you have it on your phone? Yeah So So, what do you think of man how much I need to give me per day straight up will we be good with Really come over here and put some work in try to get some shit done Well, let me let me ask you this Feel a little odd Saying that because it's kind of like insurance. Oh, you don't even have insurance No, no, not really not yet. Mmm. Oh I see. That's something I'm working on. It's all China. I'm trying to get that a little bird, but doesn't I mean, I think it's gonna be a bird but Are you talking about your shoulder thing or your back back thing? What You're talking about your back thing, aren't you? No, no, I'm talking about like what are you talking about? Yeah, and then you mentioned insurance and then I'm like, yeah, I'm so I'm I was thinking about like I was looking for me about since you mentioned my back thing Huh? You know, I had a I got back issues and I told you I had to back surgery. Mm-hmm Right, right. So, um, you know what spinal stenosis is Yeah You don't know that it's a medical term and I didn't know what it was so I had it so Never heard of it until then I had it Here's how it works Okay, this is how it works. Okay Spinal stenosis is a very scary thing I'll tell you why it's very scary This is why you can get it from working and you can get it from a old age Most people get it from old age Okay And what it is is your your disc in your vertebrae and everything they start like a It's called degenerative disc disease, this is where your discs are getting closer together They lose their height And it's got in your brain a healing mechanism your body has it creates the gnosis Out of it trying to heal it up But also your spinal canal is getting smaller and choking off your fucking like You know your spinal cord That's that's the situation the here's the bad part of this Right, these doctors take advantage of people with this condition They force them into fusion And They remove your artificial lamina and don't put it back I mean your lemon don't part of your lamina back there They play that game And the insurance companies apparently must be in on it because they they pay the bills, you know So they're fully aware I Don't make sense. Yeah. Yeah, that doesn't make sense Just about to send this email out well, I'm center suffering this condition with this problem that that's exactly what's happening to me You know, I mean yeah, and That's a difficult thing to be going through especially with no insurance You know, that's a bad situation So that's where a bad thing comes in at when they get your ass was when you do got insurance Insurance I'll pay for it. They pay for it and you're getting fucked I Stayed insurance. I'm they pay for every month And my fucking doctor was like, yeah, I can see what would be helpful to have artificial for some artificial lamina You can see where be helpful, but he never volunteered to actually put some there Yeah, and then I was like, oh we need to talk about having fusion in my back and then the lady's like oh You're not there yet Do you tell me Well, that's not my dear sound like they set me to fuck up The medical industry Set me to fuck up All the doctors in on it and they're all committing insurance fraud and they're all committing malpractice Against the patient You're going through a lot of pain and suffering and yeah Yeah, cuz your body changes over years and they know this shit They know this shit I Call Several doctors dude several and I call one in Wisconsin I thought the lady and she said she's gonna ask the doctor. I see ask them today install artificial lamina She got back with me and said the doctor told her they've never installed it How are your doctor's office that you've never installed it That's The crazy thing that's what I'm telling you this is pretty wild shit the doctor who did my back surgery, right? I talked to the nurse or their nurse or whatever, right? And then the lady I she kind of got her feelings caught up in and she yelled at me She said we've never installed artificial lamina never have and never will What does that tell you They're actively trying to fucking take people's lamina They're actively trying to fuck people over with fusion You get what I'm saying? Yeah, like right now are the doctor's office wants to give me three level layers of fusion in my neck right now Literally right now Literally that lady just the other day's asking on the phone said when am I gonna be ready for a surgeon? They're ready to go Of course you're ready to go you want to get paid you don't give a fuck about me You know, like it's all about the money. You don't give a fuck a fuck, you know, like two shits about what's going on with me It is so common for these motherfuckers to commit malpractice against patients that I'm telling you is crazy It is fucking crazy You see the surgeries we're talking about ain't like thousand dollars bro, we're talking about hundred thousand dollars eighty thousand dollars You know This is big money for medical shit So think about what I'm saying I Yeah, check your email now check this out I want to send you something I don't check this out look I'm gonna go to YouTube See I and I know you'd like seeing you'd like seeing receipts I don't have to bring the receipts to you on your screen. Are you ready? I yeah, you texting me the link. No, just go to YouTube. You're gonna look it up yourself Better to make a new link, huh? All right, look up can tour see a n-t-o-r Orthopedic surgeon in Florida I Thought looking it up look at their website Tell me what you see Three doctors said I needed fusion. I Got a video where one of them just totally said the other two he's gonna agree with him and say I need fusion This the way he did it to do he was like he's like if you want to go undergo a three level fusion Why would I want to do that? Think about that. What do I want to fusion? Unless it's absolutely necessary think about that Right How do I look at it? Yeah, how do you spell it? I think computers still loading All right, see a n-t-o-r Orthopedic surgeon see a n-t-o-r t-o-r See a n-t-o-r orthopedic orthopedic Surgeon Florida Or in Florida, however, you want to learn that You Do you see anything Hold on I gotta reset my internet. Are you kidding? I Had to refocus on my it's gonna be like fucking two or three months You Bro, I Want you to help me build out but you have to go 5050 with me on this app when I start disclosing what it Is I really want us in writing about this app. I Want to have it in writing? No shit a 5050 partnership before I disclose what it even is Oh Oh So like Because when I tell you about it, you're gonna say oh my god, that's a money fucking maker Yeah You will wonder why there's why has the hat why it's not happened yet already honestly You know, dr. Cantor demonstrates tools used in a spinal surgery that one. Yep. Yeah You'd like to receive so far Receipt meaning proof that they're full of shit I'm out practice case. I'm building That's pretty impressive, isn't it? Is it impressive or what you think has tools The way these things demonstrating everything to you What the technology is what it does I Just took homeboy out of his fucking Yeah, I just took homeboy out of his high chairs fucking terrible mess What do you like the video so far Obviously, it's like, you know, it's about something that serious Right, it's a medical condition something he stopped explaining to you He is talking about tools right now You know, you know how I am man, I like tools and then metal, you know I mean if it's gonna be metal, you're not gonna be robbing it some tools. I mean Oh By the way, I sent a I sent a thing in your email What's your email the thin air one, okay So that that fucking thing is What was created By my fucking But through the transcript of our conversation so I didn't like create it myself Yeah So what do you think about this when I need that I have Build an app. Yeah, I don't know problem. I have no problem building that I Okay, well what's a oh, yeah, that's right you wouldn't tell me what it's about Because this is a million dollar idea Millions I'm not even kidding. It's like seriously Yeah, and it has something to do with pull apart with pool parts Pull pull our part. I'll pull our parts pull our parts. Yeah And does it have something to do with the database Got something to do with everything. Oh god You look at the You look at the email I sent you it's no it's gonna be all be all okay Man hey, see I want to build an addition on our house and I know you can help me do it The problem is we don't got our money Mmm, that's a fucking problem How much you think cost what materialize you think it would cost them to actually build an additional to our house How big are you thinking I'm big enough for a two-car garage. I don't need that In it and it could be three stories Three stories You have to fucking like we Basically like tear down your fucking garage to make it three stories because you need a why? Why it's not it's gonna it's gonna be like its own structure. Welcome to the house Right. I'm sorry. You have to have like Properly not enough room to build a two-car garage on your next home to the house All in between your garage and your house Yeah You build right off the house perfectly with the roof, you know, but it had that extra like higher layer You know half up, you know half a layer or half a story or even almost a third three, you know three You know, I mean Not a full level higher but most of the way higher, you know, I mean 75% Have the garage where it kind of goes down into the ground a little bit Because the house is like in the ground or underground Mostly Well, well stuff that it does have windows so they mostly like half of it You know So So Maybe 25% 30% underground You know So it would be that's how that's how the garage will be and go down into the ground a little bit You know, I mean And I'd make that if can you actually view our house? I can send you a picture right now Yeah, I think the measurements you tell me, huh? Yeah. I mean I can view your house, but I can't really take measurements without certain software Yeah, but um Well, I mean, you know what, you know how big a two-car garage is. I mean, yeah 24 by 24 All right, so I'd want to see like, um, I think ours is like a little bit extra longer Our garages it's a lot longer than that It's like extra deep, you know our garages So it would be like by 24 by the way with about 30 Yeah, probably by 30 so 24 by 30 And And so you're trying to do it build it on top of it or on the side of it on the side of it On the side of it So and then that addition would it be like Basically I have like a hallway in between like like connecting the house. No, no, no When you go into the house, right It basically would it be at that level right there of the living room. It would just continue You know what? I mean? And then we I would on the other end of the wall the new space We would be extending our living room and make it larger and then we'd be making a dining room On the right side of that you know what I mean This makes sense so because you're Because your living room floor is like Like six probably like eight feet off the actual ground, isn't it? It can be six or so I Think I'm like the rim choice is probably at least like five feet off the ground or something like that Yeah You'd be about six feet off the ground You know And so you'd want to like to basically bust down the wall in between that and between there Like to extend your living room and extend your dining room Make a make a dining room Extend their living room and then to the right side of that room would be a dining room And you know you you said that you had to meant the dimensions written down for your house All right, you know I see they're coming out of the coming out of the living room it would be like, you know a header right Yeah, and then it would be a Header would go there for like parts partial the wall not the whole wall but partial half of it It would be like because it right there where the dining room is currently and the little kitchen that it has I would like to make that Extend the kitchen to where the dining room is that make sense? Yeah I'm making a dining room mother into that wall Right now where the table is to be that's going to be empty space and that would turn into a kitchen It'll give me room to make a large refrigerator more cabinets Since you're not telling me any of these measurements that I can picture this What's your address Three eleven two hundred and seventeenth Avenue Northeast East Bethel, Minnesota five five zero one one You Okay, let's see 1,752 square foot single-family home two bedrooms two bathrooms But You have more than two bathrooms now, don't you I Got to bet two bathrooms and it's got two. It's got four bedrooms. Oh Because the you made bedrooms downstairs or something There's two upstairs and there's two downstairs. Yeah, that's what I thought Yeah, you didn't have this yeah you put in the two bedrooms downstairs I remember Huh, you you did you finished your basement so now those two bedrooms are there now No, that's how it was when we got it, right Somebody else must have done it We're listed saying just two bedrooms Yeah, no Actually the city actually they want me to come in they want did they want to come in they want us to Defer them to come in here and I said no So it's why a good damn thing. I said no Yeah That would have increased the taxes That's fucking weird They blurred your house out, you know maps Really yeah I never seen anybody let them do that before And it's so weird I thought for they have blurred your house out Nobody else's house is blurred out Yeah, that's it I am convinced you were law enforcement now That fucking sketches me out Why I don't know have you ever looked at your fucking house before why the fuck you know, I've never loved Be the first to add a photo I'm gonna fucking add some photos. Hell. Yeah, I'm gonna add some photos That's fucking weird Dude if you go on Google Maps right now and type in my address my truck is the first thing that you see Well, you need something to bore your shit out I mean they blur that they have like special software that like Blurs out license plates and shit, but I had never seen a one fucking blur out a house before It's weird, maybe you were like, oh fucking doing some weird nude shit that day that they were fucking drove by We don't see anything I see all 13 photos Yeah, I had somebody else asked me I had they were like can you send me fruit pictures of the house like I they couldn't Do it. That's interesting. So what you're saying is and I can on Zillow like there's pictures of it like before you bought it. Oh Wow Yeah, do yeah cuz you paved your driveway, right it was dirt before Yeah, we we wouldn't pave it we actually put concrete in yeah I'm actually at I'm putting concrete everywhere Yeah, and and a holding cell to for Fucking officer Bonin No, I'm putting a concrete like everywhere because of the gopher's Yeah, he's gonna pave your entire yard digging Pave your entire yard and and then get a zone portion of it Yeah, like a dealership big walkways, you know I Start playing big flower beds with flowers and shit Yeah, like fucking some really big statues like and kind of place them around like for landscaping purposes I Don't have to worry about it because you said I'm bored out a lot so I put whatever out there I So we think about this addition how much they're gonna cost the building Um Right, right, right so that part, um So if it were to be is so would it be fair to say that's gonna be the same Size as the garage that's it's right next to It's gonna be as It's gonna be in come on it's gonna be built between the garage in the house in the middle Right, and then I might be a little then it's gonna be a little bit higher than the house on the top level Okay, so it's gonna be three It's gonna be at least three floors or two floors Actually floors, you know, there's gonna be a garage Below I Think you'd have to dig out like below it to make it a garage Right I'm Anthony guy anything Six feet. I mean because if it's if the rim choice is six feet that you're Then that's gonna be like the first floor Right Um Well, like you said the the next level up is six feet from the ground, yeah Right this six-foot ceilings from the ground What do you mean So like you okay, if you're standing on the ground and then if you make that concrete, right? Mm-hmm, you're looking at about five and a foot, you know five and a half five something foot ceilings You could make it six feet like you're saying dig out some And make it like make it like eight or nine feet like dig it out and pave it I mean, you know, what's the minimum six feet? Minimum garage like yeah the height of the ceiling in the garage I don't know eight or nine Yeah, you play right Okay, well whatever and then whatever it needs to be done right eight or nine feet good straight you know, whatever it looks like right and then You have to dig out some going down, okay, and it would be pretty cool So What do you think material was it would take to build this structure So it probably built the frame and build the put the windows in with the siding on So it'd be like I'm 1240 probably I'm guessing right Well, but 35 I'm 1230. I don't know So whatever it looks like good with them like whatever my dad that after my garage is but like I mean, I guess You have a three-car garage right I suppose we you don't you don't know the distance between the house and the garages See the thing is I want to like offset this offset this structure I want to push it back some so I want to build off the house, but I want to also push it back some Because there's a meter there's a power meter right there on the right side of this house So I want to like push the structure further back that way don't have to move none of that shit But would it would it still line up with the front living room area if you did do that Yeah, yeah, it'd still be able to put a doorway there probably just a regular door then. I don't know. I Mean it have a whole new living room. So I guess it really didn't matter Yeah, probably just put a door there a small little you know header Extra wide door, you know some double doors or something Um, so the Just make a hole, you know, that'll be a whole new living room Then we'll fucking use that spot for a big huge Christmas tree. You know, I mean Instead of it being the living room it'll be like I don't know Just Can't you walk through to get to the living room and let me call you right back I'm gonna do a diaper or two. I gotta do two diapers right now. Let me call you back in like seven minutes You really calling? Yeah, I'll really call back Look at a look at the email. I sent you too. I really don't know how much in a cost actually materials Would you think it might? Well, I could tell you that it says For so they're 24 foot by 30 foot Oh wait that says for garage. All right. Let me call you back",

They're tryin' to cripple you and you ain't tryin' to figure that shit out? I make my money off of health, healthcare field. Why would I let that bother me? Oh, don't worry, you're gonna be their victim then. Oh. I think... I'm already tellin' you, you're fully aware now. You're awoke. I'm woke, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I just woke you. Ha, ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha. I think I can... Yeah, no, I'm lookin' at... I'm still lookin' at your fuckin' house and doin' all those numbers and stuff. What do you mean, numbers? To tell you how big it would be? Yeah, yeah, how much you think it's gonna be? Dude, so that, this area between your house is not, is actually significantly smaller than I thought it was. I mean, I can have a two-car garage right there. Mm-hmm. It's 12, it's easy, over 12 feet. Well, yeah, I mean, it's over 12 feet for sure, but is it 24 feet? Um... Goddamn it, why don't you know these things? Alright, here, here, I could, I might be able to figure it out. If you tell me... If you tell me, um, how big your fuckin', um, how wide your house is, I could tell you how big... Well, hold on a second. Um... I think it is. So 15 feet, maybe? 20 feet? Probably 20 feet. That's what I'm guessing. I'm guessing it's probably like somewhere between like 18 and 20 feet. Which means it's gonna be smaller than a two-car garage. You know what I mean? It can't be... Right. I mean, I mean, you still can put two cars there, easily. I could park two cars side-by-side right there between this garage very easily. In that house. Yeah. Alright. So... So, what are you saying? It's gonna be like a garage and a half? Yeah, pretty much. It'd be like, um, not a full two cars. A garage and like half a garage door? That's fuckin' hilarious, man. I don't think Linda's gonna approve. Right. I'll tell her it's a new thing. Honey, it's a new thing. Everybody's doing it. Yeah. Only the half door come in today. We ordered the other door to come back one. Oh my god, I hate this fuckin' internet here. So, what'd you come up with to build the structure on? Uh... Nothing to do with street rock, drywall, electrical plumbing, none of that. Just strictly... None of that? Nope. Strictly, what'd it cost to build the structure? Uh... So, I mean, a 20x20 can cost anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000. But that's fully done. Right, right. Why would you want to estimate for something that wasn't fully done? So, I'm not gonna afford it. I mean, yeah. You could probably afford to put, like, a frame and whatever else, but... What good's that gonna do you if you can't fuckin' do anything with it? I'll hang out in that motherfucker until I get to rest. Yeah, that makes sense. My car still park in there. Shit. My son's coming in. Alright, I gotta go see my son. They're calling my name. Okay. Alright, alright. Call me back. Alright, bye. Bye.",

Are the kids still awake or are they sleeping? Yeah, I'm thinking about giving them a haircut and then getting a shower, but I have not done that yet. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of the middle of the night, but... Well, they're fucking super awake, so... Right. Is my mom home? No. Okay. Did you try their costumes on? No. Oh. I thought maybe Alex would give you his costume to try to put on or something. Yeah, I think he already forgot about it. Oh. Ugh. I feel like that medication that I took earlier, like, fucking wore off way too soon. I feel like I started feeling, like, not so good, like, an hour or two ago. Yeah? Yeah. Fucking tattoo, huh? Yeah. I felt like it was supposed to, like, be, like, destiny almost. Like, if he showed me the tattoo that looked like something I had envisioned, then I would have gotten it. But, like, it looked not... Like, the can part looked good, but, like, what I wanted him to do on the inside did not look good. And I was like, no, like, there's no way I'm about to pay, like, $120 for a tattoo for it to not look exactly what I want it to look like. And I was like, I feel peer pressured. He's like, you know, I would love to take your money, but, like, I'm also not in the business of, like, pressuring anyone to get a tattoo. Like, you know, I love my job. I love, you know, doing this. And if you're not even, like, he's like, even if you were 99% sure, like, you have to be 100% sure this is what you want. And I was like, yeah, I'm not. So I didn't do it. But I thought about it. I got his Instagram. So, like, his work Instagram. So, fucking, if I ever did want to. And he kind of lives over by Kiana. So, like, I can transfer your information to someone I know that likes tattoos. And maybe if she doesn't have a person she really likes. Because he does good work. I was like, you can go get your tattoos from this guy. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Yeah. It's a good thing that we have Camden to talk you into these sort of things. That's too bad. Too bad we didn't have, I didn't have him around when I, I don't know. Maybe we should have Camden over for dinner. You think that would be a good idea? I don't know. Yeah. Oh, okay. Well, I'm your baby daddy. So, I get to be annoying. I get to be annoying and fight with you. And what else? Oh, yeah. Yeah. And I don't even want to hear it. If I fucking told you something once, you'd say no. But if, like, Maria or someone said something, you'd be like, wow, that's a really good idea. I could do that. I don't want to hear it. Oh, no, no, it's good. Oh, you have, like, a work husband and that's good. I'm sure a lot of people do. What? Oh, you have, like, a work husband and that's cool. A lot of people do. Yeah.

It's a tattoo convention. People are getting tattooed. I don't think that's sanitary to do it outside. I kind of forgot what it was until you said it just now. Yeah, no, even the health people, the public health people are there to make sure everything is up to code. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

I got a huge question about that, where can you, because of my account and what's on Google Fi, can you see all my devices and my locations that my account is tagged to? No, no, only, no, I only asked this because I got a call from Doug today, a video call that I answered three times and was on the phone with him for like a few seconds to a minute and a half to a couple minutes and this was all at the time where I had no use of my phone and it was just chilling to the side. Yeah, I don't get it. Where, it wasn't me that answered. But it was Google Meets. Where, this is what I'm curious on, if your Google Fi can like locate my, actually. No, I'll show you what it looks like when, you go into Google, go into Google Fi yourself right now. Okay, am I supposed to be coming down there to give him a ride or what? That guy that would possibly be able to give you a ride. Hey, what's happening? How's it going? Not bad, not bad. So, it's a three and a half hour drive up there. Pretty fucking late. If you want to try to go for tomorrow and I can get myself a little more organized, I can talk to my people up there because there's something going on externally that kind of really sucks and I got to deal with actors before I can probably say, hey, let's go up. But if I can find a place to crash until Monday, when we get up there, I'll have gas money. So, I got a bunch of cash, but I don't know about doing it tonight, though. I just, I'm not entirely sure about that. So, waiting on a bunch of people to get me back on my phone. It's charging, but I'll give you a call in just a little bit. I'll let you know. I'm sorry, man. I got to take my phone's charge. You should talk to my people and see what's up with them tonight. Okay. All right. All right. Sounds good. Yep. Talk to you soon. Yep. All right.",

finished I thought I didn't I talked to you earlier though and tell you that no no I haven't gotten it finished I just got a used one yesterday and I didn't know if that's what you did this evening till now I didn't know if you were working on it tonight I was only able to work on it a little bit today for a few hours and what I was doing today was I was bench testing it okay yeah and you said the bench test everything passed where okay the coming Monday depending on with what you got available I would think that the best step for me would be to address the assessment thing first and um we're right now I'm trying to locate the dog could you text me the forest and Police Department number or the Malacca yeah I got the phone number for the place already okay all for the dog yeah I haven't called it yet though you're awesome where my my biggest concern is now I got a fucking some fee or whatever pay for watching them for a week where I'm actually quite nervous about that because depending on on it the prices can get real steep real quick and I don't know if they have any consideration for that where I both you declare made a valid point of being able to get him registered as a service dog where I don't know how to go both set on the assessment was something that I was more inclined to establish and try to set an appointment for it down the line because in a couple days here or on the 10th I'll have court Minoka where I think I don't have I don't think I have another court date when it comes to lack of stuff because of how the situation rolled out I think the judge is concerned about my my ability to be competent to stand trial because of my ability to not stay quiet when I had said explained that you know that how it wasn't fair that the Police Department had called the store owner to have the trespassing put in place for them to give me an obstruction of justice we're being at the Human Resources Center today when I had first talked to you they gave me numbers and information that that the 525 place 525 Portland where I was supposed to do the assessment originally I think is where it was supposed to be they have paralegal assistance and pro bono lawyers that are willing to do just a resource because the lady at the Human Resource Center had a moment to overhear like the bullshit that I went through that if they have that attorney services available that would be who you and I were talking about on getting finding a lawyer for the dealing with the legalities of with the Columbia Heights incident and now the forest incident where to me if it if it works out in the best nature that I just secured another paycheck to help encourage law enforcement just to leave me the fuck alone having my run-ins with them that went south because they thought they were doing the right thing to lo and behold they infringed on my fucking civil rights and my like the amendments of the United States it would be a significant encouragement to not really fuck with me or vice versa to really fuck with me and make my life a living hell where I'm hoping that's not gonna be that will come of it but at the same time I know people don't like to be told that they're doing the job and that's basically what I told them when I was getting arrested you know you're doing all this wrong this is outside your moral ethical fucking oath that you guys had given to uphold and protect and defend this citizen or the civilian where you are civil servants for the civilian because you are a civilian servant not to say that people are the boss of you but you're supposed to be out protecting us now the fact that you're calling a corporation a company that helped them vouch for you to break laws that are supposed to keep you guys at home accountable and to operate and conduct yourselves accordingly where if you can't see the corruption in it in the first place that's not okay and I understand I could be in some like pervy fucking evil fucking doer but that wasn't the case at all and the fact is the moment that I will my mouth of seeing anything where this isn't right that that's illegal you're I can't remember how I said it but it was like you're you're you're violating my my civil rights where I got this exact same situation going on where it's in my favor that I didn't do anything wrong I wasn't at no how the fucking place that no one had called me in where I'm grateful that somebody had called in out of concern for my dog and myself being sitting out here in the cold where I'm not complaining about that where all you guys had to do was roll up and say everything okay are you are you okay are you cold do you need anything where if I wasn't if my answer was I'm sorry for the inconvenience of having somebody calling on you guys about me where I'm just waiting so you said something about Justin or not Justin I'm Doug called you on Google Meets no he called me on my messenger Facebook messenger yeah and apparently I answered it and talked to him like three different times that I know for a fact that I didn't yeah I don't know somebody where he tried to somebody tried to call me on Google Meets like two days ago or something like that and I don't know who the fuck it was I don't know I like it was kind of weird I came up with David's name at first but then like it went away what's your problem David let me call

Say that again, please. I was counting how many times I brush her hair, it was like a thousand, two thousand. One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three. Yeah. Guess who's got money? Wait, what now? I said, guess who's got money? Money? Yeah. I have more money than you do. Oh, really? You think so? Yeah, a thousand. Yeah, well, hey, who knows? You could be right this time. There's something weird that happened with my payroll this week. I robbed an old man for the money I have in a truss. You did what now? I robbed an old person for this money. Oh, and that's no way to talk about your mom. Oh, not mom. She'll fight you. I've seen it. No, I saw an actual old man. I saw a man for this. Not actually, but no, I only have $10. Because mom's forcing us to go to a haunted trail. Here, hold on a second. It's going to get loud just for a second, okay? Okay. Okay, sorry about that. Yeah, that was loud. How rude of me. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear. No. Should I be expecting a call from somebody's parents? What do you mean? That you robbed from somebody that you robbed. Oh, yeah, I forgot. Don't keep up with your story already. My bad. Keep track of your lies. How unprofessional. Let me do this in peace. At least lie quickly. I'm doing it professionally. Low key, I feel like I could pull off being a man. Yeah, maybe you could. I think I just cut off my hair. Oh. Let's see. Yeah, so what do you. So you guys start school on Monday, huh? Unfortunately. What do you mean, unfortunately? Who wants to go to school? Why not? Like, I'm not going to be happy to go to school. Seven in the morning. Like seven in the morning is drastically terrible. Yeah. I'm sorry to hear that, sweetheart. But you'll probably be waking up at four in the morning for the rest of your life. So, I mean, you might as well as get get on with it, you know. You don't even wake up at four in the morning. I do, too. I do. Maybe you don't. I don't know. Right. I remember when we were living at the Ferry Street house and I woke up one morning and you just woke up to go to work. And I went to the living room downstairs and I started watching PJ Masks. It's going to get loud for a second. Okay. All right. Okay, cool. Cool, cool, cool. Yeah. Yeah, I got a new transmission. I got a new transmission the other day because I discovered that the transmission that was in it originally, like, I thought I only had to replace one thing on it. But that was not the case. It didn't do everything. More than one broken piece in there. And then, like, if I would have decided to keep using that one, I would have had to, like, get the new parts for it and, like, totally dismantle it and put it back together. Yeah. Yeah, I was like, I'll just get a new. I'll just get a different transmission and then I'll, and that's what I did. And then I spent yesterday, like, all yesterday, like, testing it before I put, before I put it in. Yeah. Yesterday sounded boring for you then. It was a little boring. Who wants to spend most of their day, like, learning stuff and doing stuff. Yeah, I bet you would much use technology for fun. Do technology stuff? Well, yeah, I mean, in my defense, I was basically looking at a tablet quite a bit. So, I mean, that's how I learned is by looking at that thing. Yeah, my order just got shipped. What did you order? Decorations for my room. Decorations for what now? My room. Oh, okay. And then, if I want more, I'm going to get more along the way. But not yet. Oh. Because I forced Gabby and mom to pay $13 and they did. Yeah. Because it cost like $26 and then, yeah, so. Would you just get a bunch of Twilight photos or what? Toilet. Twilight. Toilet. Toilet. Toilet photos. No, I'm not addicted to Twilight. I don't even remember the last time I watched it. Yeah, right. This week. I can't remember the last time I watched it this week. Okay. But I got a necklace. I got a music poster. I got another music poster and that's it. At the shiny price of $26. Nice. Nice. Wait, what? How many items did you get? Or I mean, what posters did you get? I mean. I got a ASAP Rocky. And another guy's poster. Who? Who? Yeah. Tell me who. Okay. A Suicide Boys. The Asian boys. Oh my God. That's racist. Who the fuck's that? Suicide Boys. Okay. Suicide Boys. Oh, oh shit. I didn't hear you clear that. My bad. Gotcha. What are the Suicide Boys look like? Are they white? Yes, they're white, but. That's weird. What do you think? That's racist, but. Anyway. I also have a poster in my room already of me and Penny. It's a flag. All right. Yep. And then I tried to hang up all those pictures I had on my walls, but the walls are not sticking to them. So they're kind of falling down. I'm sorry to hear that, sweetheart. It's okay. I just got to tack them together. Yeah. I'm looking at my old orders and now I realize they scammed me. Why? What do you mean? Because I was supposed to get two, four, six. Seven, six, seven, but like seven hoodies. And I only got one. Did you just say six, seven? Yes, I did. My God. Do you not know the meme? No, I don't. I don't know the meme. I haven't been on TikTok. I don't use TikTok. Only the demo uses TikTok. Interesting. But, you know, it costs $20 for one singular hoodie. And I thought I was going to get seven. My heart got broken. $25? Oh, by the way, dude, you know when you sent me that photo of that 360 degree photo? That wasn't even a 360 degree photo. It was like a lame photo. No, but I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, maybe that was Ashton I was talking to. Because I was like, take a 360 degree photo of your room for me. And she's like, I don't know how to do that. And I was like, you know, it's when you like take like a special photo and it's like, like you can, you can send it to, like, I could send you a photo and it would be like, like of a room and you could like turn around and look around and look up and down and all around in the photo. Yeah, no, I know what that is. I'm going to do it so I can show you it. Yeah. Do iPhones do that? Yep. But I think she's lying. Besides you have to be like super like steady and I'm, and I'm shaking hands so that's not helpful. If you do that, I'll take a, I'll, I'll do one too. Okay. All right. I got wipe my hands. Maybe I'll just take my gloves off for a moment. Oh my gosh, my hands are incredibly sweaty under these gloves. Little gross. Okay. Photosphere. I got all done. Oopsie. Oopsie whoopsie. It takes me a while to do mine. I didn't really work it turned out to be like very black. I'm doing this I'm putting together a masterpiece for you. Mine is coming together. Well, I guess. What did you say? Kind of got deformed in the process. You're what got what? My hat got deformed. Oh, yeah. That's funny. The door is so deformed. That's okay. Okay, I'll send it to you. Okay, I'm gonna send it to you the way it is now to. Okay. Processing. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right, let's check yours out. My kind of wonky. Yes. When I click on yours, like it doesn't, doesn't let me. Like. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. That's cool. My room's a little messy. Yeah, I saw what you sent me. It's kind of confusing to look at. Yeah. Yeah. True that. True. Yeah. No, I found this really cute photo of Atlas when I was scrolling through. Our wedding photos and I'm like, oh, my goodness. He's cute. He's such a little neon. He's such a little cute man. Yeah. Cute. Okay, sweetheart. All right. I gotta get back to work. Actually, what time is it? Okay. Yeah.

And then, um, I've returned, returned that fucking part, but you need to get the receipt for me. Where's that? Receipts? With me in the bag, my bag, and it goes to O'Reilly's. You want me to go return the fucking part myself? I mean, I can go with you. I can barely pick it up. I can go with you. Yeah. Are you like ready to be picked up? I don't want to, like, have to take you back there. Uh, no, I'm not ready to be picked up, but, um, but I don't want to wait to return that thing. Why? What does it matter? Well, cause it's like $240 some odd dollars to return it. I understand. And, uh, I'm going to want the money probably sooner than later. Like not like three days from Monday. What? If we return it now and it takes a couple of days for the transaction to settle. Then I would rather it settle sooner than later. Oh, what? Dude, this kid's been so fucking annoying. I think it's cause he didn't take like a full nap. But like, it's not my fault he didn't want to go back to sleep. Well, when do you think you're going to be done? O'Reilly's isn't closed till 8. Um. O'Reilly's isn't closed till 8. Um, I don't know. I still got other ways to go on here. Uh. Uh. Yeah. I don't know. What do you want to do? Um. I don't know. Yeah, on my way to go get you I can bring some kitty litter or whatever. And then we'll return the part tonight. Like in a couple hours. So it gives me more time to wrap up there. So when I go there, I could just pick you up instead of having to pick you up and then take you back. I suppose. Huh? I suppose. All right. It'll be done in a couple hours. It's like about to be four. Yeah, I think I, I think I'll probably be close to done in a couple hours.

Hey, I remember you said that when we were leaving the emerald zone that I left the U joint straps on the ground and you picked them up? I picked those up and put them in the, some of them are going to be in the broken window side in the back where the shelf is, where the cup holder is along the wheel well. And then you're going to have a couple that are going to be floating around in the very, very back. Where the cup holder thing is? Passenger's wheel well side, yes. Yeah, he says they're in the passenger side cup holder, just this side. And by the broken window on the wheel well, underneath where the tent poles are. Oh yeah, got them. All right, cool. I don't know. I think there was a couple that were, I think I had either put in the back behind the driver's seat or it went in straight in the back window. I can't remember where I found a couple more as we were pulling out and I went to go take a final look. I had found just like, I think it was one of the brackets and then two bolts, I think it was, where because of the rush, I think I just threw them in the back where I honestly can't. Is that other torque? Yeah, we got two bolts or two nuts. We know what we're looking for now. You said they were in the back passenger by the broken window? Yeah, underneath the tent poles, underneath where the tent poles were. And then where would you say others might be floating around? In the very back window where I would have just stuck my hand in there where I would have been, I think on top of the red tote. And with how the wiggly, wobbly experience we had, I would have no idea where they would be. With finding the ones that you did find, you'd have to kind of just quickly rummage through I guess, where I didn't put them in anything. I don't think I put them in anything, like a plastic bag and tossed them back there where it was just loosely in my hand. I'll call you back. Absolutely.",

I mean, I kind of wish I was done, but I've got to put the starter in and then get it off the blocks and I'm out of here. Okay, for sure. Both the kids like went to bed, but Atlas fell asleep kind of early, so he woke back up. So he's awake, but Alex is asleep. You say Alex is asleep? Yeah. Well, they both didn't really take naps today. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if it stays like this, I could take a little baby with me and just tell my sister to come hang out in the living room and make sure Alex, like, doesn't wake up. Yeah. They're fucking doing their intake forms for that fucking appointment and it's so much shit. Right. Well, kind of like the question I'm on, does your child have frequent temper outbursts? What triggers a temper outburst? And I'm doing Alex's right now, so I'm like, he gets upset when he doesn't get his way currently at daycare period. Currently. Okay. All right. Well, let me know, like, what are you thinking? Like 30, an hour? I'm not trying to rush you or anything. I just feel like, I mean, if you want to get out of there, like, you know, I can head there with, you'll just have like 20 minutes before I get there. So let me know when you want me to leave, I guess. Definitely don't forget to bring a kitty litter. Yeah, I'll just have to, we'll have to pick some up at the store tomorrow. Like I'll bring the one that's here and then I just have to replace it. What are you looking for? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I suppose you could start heading this way in like 20 minutes or something. All right. I'm going to leave here at 11 then. Okay. Yep. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. How's it going? I've had better. Were you able to find all the brackets? No. They're in there. I just, I really wish I could fucking think of where. Did you check your little tin can cup thing? Yeah.

    "transcript": "Where are you at? I should probably look at that since I have the ability, huh? Yeah. I'm leaving my house tomorrow. Okay. Can you get a hold of my mom? I was gonna go and have Doug or Mitch go and come with me to get my stuff over there. And as soon as she got hung up on the whole weed thing, where this is what we agreed upon, where I was going to be able to grab my board and stuff. And then she got to the point of, no, mom, I'm just doing it as you raised me. Do as you say. Say as you do. Follow through with what you say. That's what I'm trying to do. Where if you're good on the book, sweet. Well, how do I know that you're not going to pay me? Because I'm not you, mom. When is that ever the case? And I kind of threw in her face where there's going to be some marijuana issues come in. But she did ask for you specifically to be the one to be here to grab my stuff or whatever. I was going to have Doug come with me to do it. I figured that would be okay. I talked to her to see if I can get my fucking lawn mower and some change of clothes because I've been wearing the same clothes since the day I got out of the fucking hospital of when she broke the fucking bolt on my fucking face through a reconstructive surgery. She pissed me off so fucking bad. I'm just fucking living. I called her out on some shit. I let her know that her company that hires a PCA and ILS worker has turned down now two of the three people that I sent her to be her worker where Cassie has already passed the PCA certification. Brie had her PCA certification where she just had to redo it. Where they are already, so why are they not hiring her? It might have something to do with, hey, I know it's not your job, but can you hand me this? As the worker did to then watch you call me in on violation of a no contact order where I was looking to go and you took the one thing that I was looking for to go to call me in on. If she talks to her about this and I can see why they're not hiring anybody to give her her worker. I don't know if it's because I smoke. No, mom, marijuana is legal. That's not it at all. Where you put a fucking worker in the middle of some bullshit drama where she did not speak highly of you and probably shared what happened with the fucking company. Mom, how can you be so fucking stupid to not think that when they're referring to, oh, we'll guarantee that we'll get your son into a place that they never run out of room in prison ever. They'll make room for you. And she's like, you don't even know what to talk about. Mom, I know where I left my e-cig. I went in the kitchen three fucking times where when you got there with your worker, I was just finishing up dishes that you were going to have her rewash. That makes no fucking sense. Where what you did is you got your worker into where my e-cig was. You didn't want to fucking come in there to grab and me see you take my fucking e-cig. So secretly and try to hurtfully fucking get her to hand it to you. Where, no mom, where I'm so fucking pissed. Where the court fucked up saying that they were thinking that it's my mom was my, was Seth. The fucking, the no contact order. But they do have MS on the paperwork. But in court, if you were to read the transcripts and everything, they were talking about Seth and them thinking that that's who the fucking order was from. And that that's what was around. And I told my attorney this. I'm like, they're confusing the mother of my children with my mother on this no contact order. Where they have my mom's initials. That this is the one that's about. This is what the, where my mom's exact words were. He's losing his mind. He needs to get a competency assessment because you've lost your mind over these rocks. Where, no mom, I'm not a fucking idiot. I didn't throw my life away fucking chasing crack. And my children neglected fucking eating shitty ass fucking rotten food for God knows where. I learned something that she knows that. Although her dumb ass can't see it. It's going to be. It's going to change how our history is even understood. Where I just got done speaking to somebody at WC. Where she busted out some geoids and all that stuff. Where now if you were to take those images that I see in these rocks. And compare them to Mesoamerican pictoglyphs. And compare them to the Sumerian hieroglyphs. And the teophonic set. You really quickly begin to see the similarities to what it is that I'm talking about. Although it's not familiar to us. As much as it is for me for being a fucking historian fucking geek. Where again if we have a hundred different fucking fonts and textiles when it comes to the letter A. How many of these A's do you got to see over and over again to say hey. I think this is something where it may not be the exact same. There is a different accent or. Feature or font or textile or fucking whatever. But they all kind of have that same A appearance. Now I understand as time goes on. With it all being stone. That there is no real separation. But when you put AI or like an artist in there to paint the image. To give it color and to separate like part of what the pictoglyph is. For the rest of the pictoglyphs or hieroglyphs or whatever the fuck you want to call it. That I wouldn't have had the priest from fucking St. Olaf. Acknowledge the fact that we have a pyramid in the thinks here in the metro. See what I wouldn't be getting the fucking. The more I talk to people about it. I'm honing in on how to address it. Point things out. Let them. Vary or weigh into what it is that they think that they see. Where I've now had five six times of my. AI or my phone trying to address me to. Get in contact with Graham Hancock. Because he's one of the people in Gaia about how. We are a species of amnesia where we don't know a shit about a past. Where the rocks that this lady has here. We're talking about. We can go back to about a million years. Where homo erectus homo co-madness. At least six chromosomes backwards. Where we were. Whatever you like. Fucking. 46. Right now. 23 me. So we're at 46. So to go back. Six chromosomes. Where. We are. Fucking. Cave. The line. Very fast. Watch. Fucking. Head thumpers. Flat skull. That. Why don't we have any evidence. Of what it is. Where there is. That. That's. Probably true and relevant. But there is so much of our history. That is. Non-disclosed. Non-talkable. Where. We got. A fucking. Asteroid. That is slowing down. Changing directions. Where. What was supposed to be splitting. Between. Us and the moon. Is now. Just going to be coasting around. The backside of the sun. Where. It leaves a lot of potential. Of what the fuck. Where I really think. If what it is. What it is. I. I'm not even joking. Where I. Had a dream of you and I. Sitting underneath a bridge. In some weird. Fucking. Gear. Where. We were in a conflict zone. And we were. Downtown Minneapolis. Underneath a bridge. And shit. Where. It's fucking weird. But. I could see. This fucking ship. Coming through. To actually be a ship. Because since the news. And it says. Where. This is not just. What you think it is. Where you don't know. What it is. But it's fucking weird. That. I could see. If our ship. Our planet. Supposed to go into. A cataclysmic state. Like it does. Every 36,000 years. How do we know. It's not. Our fucking. Ancient. Ancestral. Relatives. That are coming. Like hey. We got to save. These fuckers. But at least get the ones. Worth saving. Off the fucking rock. To have them go. And wherever. That. I can. Foresee myself. Deciding to. Stay here. Get my kids. Off the planet. Where I'm not looking. To fucking. Continue shit on. I get to see my kids. And fucking. Try to make the best. Of it. Because I can't see myself. Truly willing. To fucking. Want to go into. Submerged. Underwater living. In a fucking. Container. Or fucking. Out in outer space. In a container. Because of. The fucking shit. That I went through. Because of her as a kid. Where I'm not claustrophobic. But it's pretty fucking. Close. Like I can't. Handle being. Inside closed structures. For too long. And like. Thinking. That I'm never gonna see. Like. That's what kills me. When I go to the hospital. To jail. Is they're taking away. The wind. They're taking away. The stars. And they're taking away. My sky. Where I. I'm a fucking. Non-successful. Domesticated. Fucking. Experiment. Where. I'm. Too wild. Of a fucking. Animal. That. It just. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Undomesticatable. That fucking. She pissed me off. She just literally pissed me off so fucking bad. Cause. All she was hung up on. Was the weed. Where mom. Wouldn't have I ever fucked her. You're the one that has robbed me. So many fucking. Times. Taken my money. Where. How many times. Did I have to go. Growing up. That you had no problem. Going to the bar. Every fucking. Day. Coming back. A week. To a week later. With the fuck. And it's the same fucking day. Where now I'm eating fucking moldy rotten ass food. Not knowing anybody. Cause why would you give me moldy rotten ass food. Where you're too high drunk as fucking stone. Realize that. Hey. A week has gone by since I seen my kid. And fucking. Give me the food that you didn't finish at the bar. Where. That was my fucking money that I was paying the rent. That I was paying for the booze. That I was getting fucking. The charity fucking clothes given to me. I'd go. My grandma would take me shopping once a year for shoes and a backpack and clothes. That would have to last me all year. Where. I. I. Fucking. So goddamn pissed. Where. I. I know that I just unloaded a shitload on ya. Where. Can you call my mom. Where I really want to get my longboard out later. Are you on your way here. Where I was gonna either swing by. Have Doug grab ya. Or whatever. But. He. I mean I'm here just to say that. That. We had this Lumidge kid. Doug is down on going through the drive. He was curious about what it was that you hadn't talked to him about with Dan. Where if we were making the fucking grand tour. We might as well make the best out of it. Have relations. Sit down. Shake hands. Fucking do everything. Especially after having dropped in fucking. This Mitchell kid off. But he has a 91 Toyota Caselle that he's considering on giving me or having me buy for $500. Since I took care of the fucking $500 that was going towards the bail for next month. That I was going to use that to get this god damn car. That gives me $100 to go and start my fucking driver's diversion whatever the fuck it is. I can make my monthly payment to get my fucking shit in order to have my license. Have a car right there where the LLC that whatever it is to get figured out so it's not in my name right off the bat. Where I'm ready to start implementing some shit where at the human resource center we're trying to get him set up to get to the midget like everything that would have been available. The lady got to overhear me bitching about how I got fucked on this whole fucking entrapment that they did on me. That the human resource building has pro bono lawyers or legal aid and assistance all at the fucking government center. Where I'm ready to fucking take care of the Noca County, take care of the fucking Mille Lacs County, take care of the fucking. If I have a civil commitment and everybody's telling me I'm fucking insane. Why am I denied psychiatric and psychological service from every fucking hospital in the god damn state where I get fucked on COVID. Where I got so many different lawsuits where I'm ready to just cash in by Nicollet Island, my fucking island. Where there's three vacant lots on there that are still available to have purchase bills of land on. Where would you like to be my neighbor to live downtown Minneapolis off of Nicollet Island. That kind of deal where I'm not even joking. I'm ready to fucking get. I'm about to lose service. I'm about to lose service because I'm getting close to Dan's. So I'll try to. Yeah. I'll call. Yeah. Say what to her now. Try to get her. Try to get your stuff put together. Try to try to allow Doug and Mitch to go over there and get, get my line word or whatever. And then I'm fucking closed. And at this point I don't even want to fucking take care of weed where I was. I wanted some weed where she has the half that I was going to get to her. Where I also told her I fucking will be having some, some good amount of bud and it's going to be cheap and it's going to be good that I let Mary know that, you know, she might not have having something that to him because he's in the swing of things where he only likes to flip track and fucking bud that that's his clientele list where I don't know if he does anything. Like, I think he's kind of sober, but I mean, he's all about his money is he has a fucking a barbershop for his kid that is running it, that he didn't come here for a while. And he has a full-time job working somewhere else where he kind of reminds me of where I don't know if you ever heard of Hennessy and Tennessee, but they're brothers that are all about slaying and fucking. I've heard from everybody as they promised me that it's the best in the state that's available right now. Yes. I'm going to, I'm going to lose service. If you want me to call your mom, then I got to get off the phone now. Whereas yeah, where I was going to figure that you're going to do what you're going to do. And whenever your service came back through that, yeah, no, where you do you where I wasn't going to do this whole Bemidji thing until probably tonight or in the cracking hours of dawn. So it is going to be a seven hour tour, but he can't access his bank for the fucking cash until like 8 AM tomorrow because it's a Bemidji only bank where, yeah, it having everybody to get together on setting some things up because having another person out there and the swing of things. And would it only be better to make that one round trip as it is where it, it just, it has a lot of fucking potential on satisfying a lot of different people in a few different ways. If it's about money, it's not fucking productive and success on top of the, where I think this kid could use your service where if you need another client, I think this kid is somebody that you could probably fucking help out with where he lives all the way out in Bemidji. I don't know how I'm going to like, help, like, be able to work with him that long. Where is he remotely fucking Zoom wise where, because he has, okay, where, where I would be willing to fucking pick him up for a weekend or if I could make a trip out there for a night where the details would be something to be negotiated. Or if you even know a colleague that's up in the area to direct him to go through or any assistance would be better than no assistance, where it would be someone towards that same cause of like the assistance that he needs, where I busted his sobriety that he's been sober for like eight, 10 years. But because of all the shit that's happened where I going over to cars, I didn't say anything about it. We were like, fuck right now. I just want to suck and smoke where I didn't even be willing to spend something. I'm like, well, it's funny that you say that cause I wasn't going to say nothing. How do you really feel? That could be an option too, where he's not really wanting to be down in the city because he knows how he's going to go, but he's going to help me become a pro skater, the international gravity sports association or whatever, where he's telling me how he got his sponsorship by the news. He's out of a no cover. That's amazing. He's not where if I have that underneath me too, that would be only something more beneficial for me to show my kids where I haven't been at all. Anything of what their mother has told them about me, where I I'm finding my fucking oldest, like I think I saw him again, I'll enforce them because he knows where this kid, when I'm sitting there at the fucking tire pump, some kid rolls up on this electric scooter wearing a helmet and fucking face shield and shit, where he kept on looking at me where it's a scooter with hard wheel tires. So why is he pumping air in his fucking scooter tires when it doesn't take air, you know, it's not like an air tubes tire as much as it's kind of like a skateboard wheel. It's a solid fucking wheel where I, and it, the way that this person kept on looking at me, I think it was my fucking oldest kid. Do you know what your oldest kid looks like? I just got a picture of him not too long ago where my mom is mad that I shared a photo from my profile of them where, where she's trying to help keep my kids where that is so fucked. Where if I had my kids, I probably would only smoke bud where enjoy my hallucinogens where my fucking other form of meditation is the one thing I guarantee you, it stops me from fucking killing myself to get the fuck off this rock and away from fucking people like her. Where I knowingly what it, what the statistics does on doing something as stupid as that, I can't do that to my kids. I don't know what fucking anybody expects me to do or being fucked over so goddamn hard when it comes to this and not having a single fucking person in my family that speak up and say, Steph, you're a fucking piece of shit. How can you do this to your kids? Where I don't know what my kids think of me, where all I know is they think all I had to do was go to a courthouse and sign a stupid fucking piece of paper and then they, I could see them. And why haven't I done that? That's the last message I got from my oldest kid, like nine years ago, which that wasn't even the fucking case dating Jamie fucking Franklin. She works for the fucking prosecuting attorney as well as the Minnesota, uh, legal twin cities, like business fucking end of the prosecuting attorney's office. She couldn't even help me successfully fill out the fucking, um, custody, fucking request paperwork to establish any type of fucking certified custody where Steph, and stop bringing the kids where, what the fuck was I going to do where two years went by and within six months I had the felony plea, telling the cops that I had a fucking gun when I ran back to the fucking truck to grab my bag of weed. Because if I'm going to be sitting in a tree or in the swamp, fucking waiting for the fucking cops to pull me down with a fucking ladder, I was going to fucking just sit and smoke until the fucking, I was ran out because I smoked so much weed every time that they went to pit me, I would just fucking roll blunt or pack a ball, flick them off, driving backwards and then go five miles slower than before where that's another thing that I have our police case without breaking a single fucking movement violation signal at all fucking turns come to complete stops where I just wanted to get out of the vehicle or allow them to fucking lift me out of the vehicle until they fucking got my ass hung up on the goddamn bus guard. Like it was probably one of the most epic fucking experiences I've had that I am so proud of it where I wish I could get fucking dash cam footage of it. But I mean, she drove me insane and my mom was more on her side it seemed like than anything else. My mom blames me and why she's insane, where I don't even know what to say about that. Where she just pissed me off so fucking bad, like I don't even know what to say, like literally. Because she was so hung up on me not paying her because fuck mom, but no mom, I'm not a piece of shit like you are. I was raised better than how you operate. Where out of just your arrogance and pride, I will do the right thing because you just don't know what the fucking right thing is. Where I have a very strong understanding where I know very little of your raising. But I know that you don't have the best relationship with your mother either. And I think that I do know, I think that there's a lot of things that you can relate to. No, no, not me. I love my mother. I love her. Gabby's calling me. She's never done anything wrong. Not once. Okay. Gabby's calling me right now. And I'm also arriving at this place too. So I'll give you a call back. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.",

Because I was busy lore dropping. Lore dropping? Yes, I was dropping the lore. In public? Nah, gang. That sounds sick. Dude. Sorry, I was stretching. When are you going to be here? I don't know, probably about 12 or something like that. I love how you guys are hanging out. About 12-15, 12-30. Okay, I can barely hold my phone right now. Bye. Hello? Hi, are you on your way back? Yes. Okay, good. I kind of fucked up on the time and we were actually supposed to leave like 30 minutes ago. Can you shush? Why? Hi. Hi. Like anytime I get on the phone, he's like hey, hi, hi, and it's like to me. It's not even to whoever I'm on the phone with. Oh my god, and then Atlas is being mad annoying too. Fucking do not like this kid these days. He's like pushing his head up against my leg. Like I don't even know what he wants from me. Oh, maybe his goldfish that I had to take away because he's fucking trying to shake them all over the place. Anyways, I got the boys like basically dressed. We're all showered. I'm just waiting for my clothes to get out of the dryer. Yeah, and then I talked to Kiana and Kiana's actually going to go and pick up both Brandon and Ava since I fucked up on the time and then we're just going to meet her there at the place. So we kind of have to leave like ASAP because we were supposed to meet at noon there. That was the plan, but for some reason I was thinking like, I don't know why I was thinking like I'm picking up Ava at noon. I was supposed to pick up Ava at like 11 basically. Atlas, what are you doing? Dumbass. Alright, so how far away are you? I'm in Bach right now. Okay, so you like basically just left? Yeah, a few minutes ago, yeah. Yeah, alright. Sounds good. So I'll see you in like about 20 minutes. Hopefully I'll be more prepared then. Well, the bag, I'm pretty sure the bag's already in the back and I think it's already like basically packed. So really it's just getting these kids to calm the fuck down really and get in the fucking car. Dude, this kid's like trying to like go back up inside me or something. He's like in between my legs pushing his head into me. That's weird. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's real fucking annoying. Yeah. Did you do everything you needed to do? Yeah, we loaded the truck up on the trailer and we're bringing it over to the hospital. Which one? This one? But when I get there I need to like change clothes and then we can go. Are you not that dirty? I'm not wearing, what I'm wearing now isn't what I'm wearing for the rest of the day. What you're wearing now is not what you're wearing for the rest of the day? Correct. I understand that, but I meant like is your body not dirty? Like do you need to shower No, I'm not dirty. Okay, cool. All right. Well, yeah, I mean I threw your black jacket like that one zip jacket in the dryer like with my white wash and dryer with my clothes and then I folded the clothes at you. Oh my God. Maria is going to get engaged today. She's going to get what? Engaged. Oh really? Because it's going to happen dot dot dot. I'm so nervous and he invited my family because she knew that it was like coming up. Why am I uncomfortable with that idea? My family is not the thing. She's funny. But yeah, she's I guess getting engaged today. This is my moment, not theirs. I suppose maybe he thought you want them there. Wanted it more private. Okay. But yeah, so when you get here, yeah, you can change. Like I said, hopefully the boys will be all ready and you need an oil change. I need an oil change. Yes. Okay, that could be added to the list when I get my next fucking mileage check or something because I need to use the money to get us fucking tabs before we get pulled over and get more tickets. Baby, I need you to stop. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. All right, bye. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Hey. How's it going? You know, I'm so fucking confused right now that I don't even know where to begin. Sitting at Doug's and having this plan to go and do this, he tells me he wants to get some rest and asked me to leave to get some rest and I totally get that I don't want to be overbearing and fucking intruding and as we're walking out he gets in the car and leaves where I thought and talking to him I said, you know, we'll be back in the morning and if we get here do you want me to try to wake you up to go to Mary Jo's still where I can't get him up and I've never known him to be dishonest or pacifying for things and I won't ask what the fuck but it feels like I fucking stepped into a twilight zone where shit's just not making sense and like I'm fucking confused as fuck on like what the hell happened because after waiting a day and a half I'm not sure what it was that I missed when it came to like not understanding what the fuck is going on, getting rest where we had talked about that on Saturday before like it was actually like he was aware that money wasn't gonna be available until Monday today where I was trying to leave at like fucking 4 or 5 in the morning and get there by like 8 so he can get into the credit union and pull the cash out for him that I'm fucking just confused as shit where I don't get it where he is no auntie as fuck that I was trying to ask him for my fucking lottery ticket that I had found at the church where this is where I found that Armani Imperial fucking watch at the altar that fucking somebody had took my cup that I had left at the altar that was like full of soda and where do you want to make some money I need to get the truck running before I leave to go do anything oh I said I need to get the truck running before I can do anything oh yeah what's what's going on now I'm well I had to take the starter off you know like I did the other day but I was missing the the the nuts that go on there so I had to like improvise on the nuts that I've used and like the negative terminal on the starter doesn't have a nut on it at all right now so it won't turn over but that's my what I got to do right now is is uh I get that all attached properly you want to know what's fucking generic as fuck but works really really well one of those twist tie bread ties you strip it of the paper and you put the terminal up as tight as you can and then you have the one two wraps around the thread underneath it and then you have it make contact where with that metal wire making contacts through the thread and securing it to the fucking starter it works really well for a quick fix that washer that dishwasher and that chest freezer in 65 and fucking County Road 116 there's appliances by Steve he buys appliances and with both those things working that's like a hundred bucks 200 bucks I don't know what he'd pay for the ice chest but he pays $40 for broken appliances if it has parts that he needs for other machines because he refurbishes them so that that's money there where I don't think trash would have came to pick up the chest or the dishwasher yet but I did get it out of Jess's backyard and have it sitting behind the dumpsters where they're not set up to get picked up yet that uh that would be money on on the trip up or whatever for that immediate need for gas if that was needed where the ice chest I don't think would have fit in Doug's trunk but that dishwasher with the trunk open totally would have was like a ratchet strap or something where I'm leaving a church right now that they gave me a Metro Mobility number and for it being a what is it Alfonso's Church of the Catholic community it's the Knights of Columbus I found it very odd that they didn't have anything that they can assist me with for their first thing that they had said to me is they don't give any money where I was like actually it's a precarious situation and just the opposite of what that is where he has money he's looking to pay somebody for the ride where you can't find it that's when they sent me they told me about uber and stuff I'm like I'm aware of that but the problem with uber is you got to do it online and you got to have a card where him just opening his stuff up he hasn't gotten his card yet in the mail or he could probably have it sometime this week but like as good as an idea as that is it was something I hadn't thought of and I told her that we would already gone to fuck in the Human Resource Center for looking for that route where because of living alone or whatever he doesn't he has no one to call to say yep he has a place to go where I where I I don't know if I if it's me that's just just naturally dysfunctionally retarded or or is it like fucking it really feels like the world fucking flipped on its fucking self where we're going in the jail and coming out there is like two days that like everything felt normal and then fucking yesterday shit flipped again where I don't get it I really just struggling to understand what it is that I'm not comprehending or failing to see or what information I'm lacking that I'm not fucking understanding this where I've never had such a fucking difficulty especially when there's money involved I know that the 50 70 bucks or whatever that he's offering for the gas or that that's obvious fucking thing where you need the gas to get there to do it in back but he was gonna kick Doug a fucking zip where that's at least $200 right off the bat unless you want to fucking part it out that that's $280 $300 where I figured $300 would be an excellent incentive to want to do it especially if you're in a situation needing money and having the need to go to Mary Jo's to ask to help get pay a bill where it I I don't get like what the fuck is wrong with the world but in that aspect that those a guy he's only special trying to get his shit out of storage that he needs a truck and a trailer or he has trailers but that they're not at the storage unit and I'm not sure if they're ready to get hooked up and to go and grab the shit but he's trying to get that done today before tomorrow or whatever when it's due or this week I'm not exactly sure what what his deadline is what that's what she's doing and that's where he's at right now that um you don't have a fucking receiver do you I do is your vehicle able to pull I mean I just told you I have to get it running first right but yeah it does pull trailers and all that yeah okay we're and I don't know what he's not the type of person to just fucking oh thank you and fucking dip out where those is a really old-school solid guy where he's a fucking he's a debt collector or a fucking regulator or whatever the fuck you want to fucking call it or title it that um when he saw me with my buses up I was the first time I ever seen the old man get mad where he reminds me a lot of the fucking marina I worked with for fucking 20 years that um he's the guy that has that bead breaker and bead setter fucking thing that he he made that goes into your receiver so you can fucking tell me gets a flat tire on the road they don't have a spare you can pick up the tire as you're on your way to fucking get the car where you don't have to make that to check where you can just do it right there on the spot with the machine that mounts the fucking around with this guy I started walking around with them at about an hour before I would have thought that we would have been leaving either come pick you up to make that trip out there if you wanted where he took off but he's so antsy he had left his backpack and stuff at Doug's because of him going to sleep for a little bit and the day before it was talking about how he was just gonna sleep on the way up then I was gonna drive where I don't know like this is where I'm so fucking confused but yeah where I'm not gonna fucking get this close to fucking getting there and then just bail on him but did he so he bailed on you no where he he's you he's trying to wake Doug up where I I've called Doug I've sent him a message knocked on the door um I even tried to wake Daniel up in the back where I I don't know like what had changed or came out where that I'm really trying to fucking wrap my head like what it is that I'm not perceiving where as soon as my mom had asked if it would be you instead of Doug to come out and fucking have stuff where my mom's like I don't know where anything is bullshit mom you know where everything is in your fucking house when it comes to my stuff because it's in that fucking closet where I don't really want to fucking come there and see ya and you're so gung-ho on you don't know if I'm gonna fuck you over on fucking where mom I'm not you I I that that thought doesn't even cross my mind where and and from that point on it seems like the fucking everything flipped where I there's a good chance that I'm going to say goodbye to my mother when I do get my fucking podium escapers out of there that is for her to tell me a little maybe in a couple where no in a couple days you can go choke on a dick for all I fucking care because I'm over it the fact that you looked at me and intentionally started hitting me in the fucking jaw to break my fucking balls like I I'm so disgusted and repulsed by her and her fucking behaviors and her fucking selfish spoiled little fucking bitch ways that I don't even know what to fucking say like I really don't like I I am fucking I just I don't I don't fucking get it did I lose you what I what I thought I lost it where my phone keeps trying to send a message to Cassie and Dakara my phone just keeps turning off like and I don't know what it is I tried to do the factory reset thing and that didn't work out the record on the pixel yeah and you have like a totally charged battery it's not totally charged but the times that it when it was doing it I had it wasn't even in the red where and I guess ultimately that that was the precursor where shit just started getting really fucking weird like really weird well like I'm I'm like trying to figure out if I'm fucking dreaming I guess on just how weird shit has been like unfolding I guess there was a miscommunication between my when my appointment I was supposed to be in right when my appointment I was supposed to be in right now and so I that means I would have 43 minutes 40 40 minutes before the next appointment starts okay uh if you don't have enough that fits like I said try that uh red twist tie fit route of things where um I was thinking of just going to the hardware store with the with the thing that's another option where I suppose you sit and walk in distance for a few isn't it yeah where that's ultimately go to and you can't find the nuts for for in your little tin cup or in the back no I couldn't find them okay where and to me like I I know that thing was fucking swaying hard especially for the fucking transfer case to fall over like it did where I that that's that that to me that's that weird shit where like I I can't even fucking wrap my head around why you would have had any problems trying to find the other fucking hardware that I found as we're pulling out and I got that last little bit of hardware that I had just on the fucking thing where I don't even think the hardware was there before that because I thought I had gathered everything from there and put it in like when that that night that I was there before he had gotten back where I thought I had found everything to fucking put in there that's where I think my mom has me so fucking flustered that like I'm just having like a fucking moment that squash looks like a dick let me roll back after my appointments yeah no we're at this point I I can't even fucking leave because I unless they're gonna let me reschedule for fucking tomorrow for my um follow-up what time what time is the your appointment uh 245 I think is what you sent me what say it again I think is that 245 is what you sent me yeah and you said you can't get ahold of Takara yeah and you said you can't get ahold of Takara uh Takara's fucking not even considered an option because she needs money now and we're okay that where I I can't do it where she is acting really fucking weird and we're really weird we're I think I think that might have been the pre the the beginning offset where Saturday came through and we get about a day to three days together before like I can't tolerate her anymore and I fucking leave where it's I she was bitching at me about touching and fumbling through and uh getting handsy on where I didn't touch fucking anything like and she's bitching at me where I'm really like looking at the situation I'm like you every time you bitch at me it was frivolous like and the we're don't ask me to do anything if you don't like how I do it and that that's just where I'm at where if it's she doesn't have the tools or the parts for me to work on her I'm just not doing it anymore I'm not gonna fucking half-ass fucking fucking crack crackhead shit well I thought you were inside where I'm talking to Brandon right now where he has I'm gonna let you go so you can get your shit done um give me a call when you're done all right yeah yeah I'll give you a call when I'm done okay",

    "transcript": "Hey, Zack, this is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Hey, Brandon, how are you doing? I'm doing all right, man. What's going on? Not too much. Just kind of had a couple of different appointments today and some running around. How are you doing? I'm doing good, man. I'm doing good. I just kind of want to talk to you about something that's kind of been on my mind. Just with the whole mentorship stuff. Yeah. Because I know, you know, we kind of scheduled that stuff and it's just kind of been a little bit difficult. And I don't think Sunday's a really good time because I still get those confirmations. And, you know, I think it's going to definitely be challenging. And, you know, I don't want to, you know, I really don't want to make that like an issue. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I totally understand. And that's kind of the thing. I know that you've got a lot of responsibility. And yeah, I don't I don't I definitely don't want you to feel obligated to that as well. But I got to say, I'm super thankful for that for meeting with you. And maybe if I could just meet with you every once every couple of months or something like that or I don't know, whatever is clever, really. Well, I think I'm not going to lie. The weekdays are probably going to be the best. Even when I'm here at work, even on my lunch break or something like that. I think that might be a little bit more possible. Yeah. Yeah. You know. Yeah, I like that. Yeah. Yeah. There's one to like communicate that, you know. Yeah. OK. Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of about. Just your performance and CPRs. And, you know, like, you know, your name came up in one of our meetings. That has to just do with under 20 hours, you know. I think like two weeks ago, you got me pretty decent hours, like 25 hours or something like that. But last weekend, you know, pretty much the rest of the month, it's all been 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours or something like that, you know. So what was the like what changed during that week? I believe was the week from the 5th of October to the 11th. You had about 25 hours. Was there anything different? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've spoke like between me and my partner and we kind of sat down and had like one of those fiscally responsible conversations where we're like, OK, well, how much money are you taking in? OK, well, how much money could I be taking in? My partner, you know, my my spouse, my baby mama. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, we determined that it would be better for me to to work, you know, more full time. You know, that way she would be the one dropping the kids off at daycare and picking up the kids from school. And and and also she's got a practicum that she's got to start preparing for at the end of this month. So she's going to be not working at all at the end of this month. And then so basically we decided that, you know, she was going to be that person so that I could, you know, do my best to start, you know, at like 8 a.m. and go, you know, basically have two appointments a day rather than just like that one and then having to do appointments in between. You know, it's it's. Yeah. But that's what made it better is, you know, we're kind of diving right into that. And then what changed in the last couple of weeks? I don't know. I think I think we just need to kind of reinforce our action on that, because I right now, I think with my my truck having had some issues, I naturally should just be at work if I'm not working. But now that I got I got to get my windshield replaced and I should be back at it. OK. But is that like stopping you from meeting? It hasn't. No, even even while my even while my truck has had work done, I've still been able to, you know, use my other car. Yeah, I want you to think about it, though, because that's kind of like what I'm thinking about is, you know, so the beginning of October, the first week, you have 12 hours of like services you provided. And then the week after that was like 25 hours and then the week after that was 11 hours and then last week was nine hours. So the week of the 25th, what was different from the past those other weeks? And why do you believe it is like relatively low? I think it's just you can really think about it like factors. Yeah, I don't I don't know, I guess I guess the only reason I would have is that it's low is just because I haven't been taking two appointments throughout the day. Like I anticipated, I was going to, which I think it is in my I know it's in my range to be able to do it. And especially with my clients. Do you feel like there's not a lot of motivation? No, no, no, no, definitely not. Definitely not that. So and so you're saying it's just not getting to the appointments? No, no, I guess I guess the short, simple answer, the reason why is just because my obligations at home kind of called me back. You know, I couldn't or like I would start late. Hold on a simple answer. Yeah, my obligations at home called me home sooner than I would have liked. Or I had to start later than I would have liked. Okay. Yeah, I mean, it is definitely concerning, you know, because I believe you do have the capacity to, you know, go out there and meet with clients and I mean it's not even part time what you're doing. It's almost as if like it's very low, you know. Furthermore, like I remember just when we brought you on and I wanted to start you at 21. And you said like, hey, that's pretty low. Would you be able to bump it up and I don't know if you remember this conversation that I had with you, where I was pretty much saying like hey okay well you know because you're in more. You said, you know, you know, I could go to Minneapolis, the Twin Cities or I could go to St. Cloud and I said, you know, I think if you go to St. Cloud, there's definitely a lot of clients there. Heidi's out there, and other CPRS's and if you were to go up there and work there and sort of like be consistent in that, then I could get you to 23, which we did automatically like it wasn't like a trial run like I just made, you know, we wrote you the offer letter right away. And, you know, honestly, I do understand like obligations at home and things like that. But I also don't think you're holding up like your end of the deal. Okay. Does that sound fair to you or irrational. I guess. I don't know. I guess I don't, I don't see the amount of hours, it is, I guess I see the amount of work that I put on out there. So I guess I'd have to say my experience so far has been really positive. I understand that the 20 hour. Is it 21 hour or 20 hours. 20. 20. Yeah, I understand that the 20 hour contract is kind of binds me to perform a certain way. And, and I see that I fallen short of that, no doubt. I think I even got a write up for it. Probably about four weeks ago. Yeah. Yeah, so I'd have to agree with you there. Yeah, so I mean, does that concern you, because is that something that. Yeah, I mean it concerns me. It concerns me a little bit. Yeah, I mean, not just a little bit. Yeah, because I don't want to, I don't want to lose this position. No, and I don't want you to, I don't want you to either. Right. But I do think it's like, it's, you know, at the end of the day is a job. Right. And, you know, the people that you're working with the clients that like need no services that are being assigned to you. I don't think there is a shortage of people who need peer recovery services. I think the resources are there. So that really leads me to ask kind of like how are things with you is everything okay. You mentioned kind of stuff going on at home. What do you see as a possible solution to get you to become, you know, average part time staff if not full time, so that you could, you know, do the work that you enjoy doing. I think I just need to get my truck back. There's a special answer I guess, but how long have you had your truck. How long have I not had my truck you mean. Yeah. So it went out. It was on Wednesday. Not last week, but the week before. So it's been about a week and a half now. I had to do the transmission and get three of my windows replaced some glass. Yeah. Right. I mean the truck. If it was a week and a half ago I mean you've had, you know, consistently under 20 hours for quite some time. And it's the only reason that I'm having this conversation really. It was like a one off thing or something like that. You know my job is to really just understand exactly what it is that's going on, and try to see if there's anything that I can do to help. You know, in the least just at least trying to see if we can figure it out together you know. Yeah, I mean I think another thing, and we've run, we got this goal of moving down closer to the cities, because the hour long commute is kind of, kind of a drag, but at the same time, I had the opportunity of working, like, just once or twice kind of close to my area out here. Yeah, I guess I shouldn't, like, totally. Yeah, but I guess, I don't know, aside from like what Huda explained to me the other day, she said that recovering hope here in town is short a CPRS. So that would mean I might be working out of there a little bit more with their clientele, which would mean I wouldn't have the commute on those days. And I'm totally open to that. Yeah. I guess I just need to follow up with her to see if she has had any updates on that I guess. Okay. Yeah, I mean, opportunities like that here come here and there, you know, but I do understand the location does make it difficult. You know, if you are able to go to St. Cloud or here in the Twin Cities, there's definitely opportunities. You know, I don't think that happens in a day, you know, could definitely take some time. Like, especially like with the relocation and whatnot, but, you know, eventually though, you know, you have to get to 20 hours a week, you know, and we will try to do what we can to provide you with resources and clients and, you know, we're trying to always like increase our partnerships with people. Partnerships with different organizations and stuff. So, but if that's not able to happen in the meantime, you know, I do think commuting to St. Cloud was going to be your best bet. Yeah, to commute, but also, you know, there is work there. There's a lot of clients there that need services. Initially, that's kind of, you know, the promise that you made. Right. Right, right, right. I understand. So, I mean, I'm trying to, you know, I'm trying to work with you here, you know, but we got to stick to our policies. Okay. I totally understand. Okay. Yeah, I'm on board. Yeah. Okay. Okay, good. Yeah. Yeah, let me know. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. I totally understand what you're saying, and I totally take this phone call for what it is, and you're just reaching out because you don't want to see me go and you want to see me successful. I totally appreciate that. And, yeah, I guess the only thing I could really ask for right now is just some patience, because I know that I'm going to improve my hours so that, you know, my goal is to have 40 plus hours. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, you know, I don't know that though, right, like I, I believe you, but also, like at the end of the day it's, you know, I'm going off of, you know, this conversation that we had when we first brought you on, you know, and the fact that that didn't pan out and it really just kind of went how it went. You know, I am a little just a little bit disappointed. Because that's like the reason that we start people off at $18 an hour, sometimes 19, depending on your experience I thought $21 was a good amount. And I wanted to give you that opportunity. And the reason why we do that is because a lot of people, you know, they want to join the team, and then when they do, the effort is really bare minimum. And it's enough to get by. But it's like, you know, that's, I mean, and to most people's, you know, defense like this, it can be a challenging job. I get that. You know, but why commit to something. If you're not willing to take on that challenge and endure that. Does that make sense. Yeah. I can tell you're really disappointed about the St. Cloud thing. Yeah, I mean, at the end of the day, I mean, that was a, that was a, just a contingency of making, you know, giving you that $2 increase. Sure don't do for everybody, you know, but he had a really great interview. And I want to, I love giving people those opportunities, you know, but the whole time I just kind of been watching on the side. And, you know, looking at the hours and I'm not saying that you're like a terrible CPR or anything, that's definitely not what I'm saying. But also, it does kind of look like, you know, the bare minimum. You know, and does that have to do with the fact that you live in more probably right and the challenge that could come with that, but that's why I figured you know if you're able to travel and make that commute. Then it would be helpful, which is something that you agreed to ultimately, you know. So, I mean, does that sound rational to you though. That I'm able to do that. No, just like my concern, like the reason I have this concern. That sounds fair. Yeah, yeah I mean I just looking at my, at my time sheet. Yeah, I would definitely be making the same call that you're, you are right now. Yeah. So I just want to ultimately just figure this out. And, you know, if you're saying that like once you get your truck back and things are able to change and then yeah, but I would like you to uphold that that commitment of making that commute to same file. If it's too much of the capacities there. Okay. Okay. I mean I do have a couple of clients out there and, and I see that there's opportunity every time I just when I was out there the other day, I was able to kind of meet new people. And even some people that are were a part of my recovery out here, and more. Yeah, there's, there's definitely opportunity. Okay, so what. I mean, how do you how do you want to go about this moving forward, so that we're on the same page. Um, so I guess I mean we're going to, we can communicate that my, my goal is the 40 hours, and, you know, obviously, let's start with 20. Okay, let's just start with 20 right 20 if you get to 40 hours that's great that's more clients that you're serving, building those relationships with, but we just asked them 20, which is really like on the low end of part time, you know the high end would be 30, which is 30 is still part time, you know. So, if you can get to 20. Okay. Well, I think that I can well I know that I can do that. Okay. And I've got to call back my, I had to call back my partner now so I can have that discussion with her as well to kind of reinforce what our, our plan was. Okay. Okay. Do you have a second job. No. Okay. And then your supervisor is my mouse. And then also just, you know, communicate with him about like how you could the best way like increase your hours or, you know, build on your caseload. And I'm pretty sure he can assist with that as well. Yeah, absolutely. So, I'll be watching man and, you know, we'll, we'll reconvene about this. Okay. So I appreciate you know the work that you're doing, you know, I want to have you on the team, but also do want to see improvement as well. Being a CPRS. Absolutely, absolutely. Well, I'm motivated to do that call. Yeah. Yeah, you can always give me a call to if there's any issue or something that you want to know or anything like that. Okay. All right, well I appreciate you giving me a call. It's good to hear from you. Yeah, absolutely. You got a busy week. Ah, let's see, let's see. Well yeah we'll get the March conference this week. I'll be attending. What's that busy. The March conference is. What does it stand for it's like the Minnesota addiction and recovery conference. It's like a huge conference with pretty much all the addiction and recovery providers in the state of Minnesota so like many different treatment centers nonprofits government agencies. And there's like just conferences and people talking and things that change legislation, all that stuff so it's pretty big conference. And that's in Forest Lake you said. No, I think last year they had it in St. Paul. I don't know where they're having it this year, I have to check, but, but we got, we have, I got a ticket so I'm going to be going up there tomorrow. Yeah, definitely look it up check it out. Yeah, please to connect. It's called the March conference. Yep. A. I think there's two Rs. Ch. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna look that up that sounds interesting. So, expensive, expensive ass tickets or what. Say that again, super expensive tickets or what. I think they're like maybe 70 bucks. Okay. Okay. All right, well I'll look into that. But I'll talk to you soon though. Maybe sometime this week. All right. Yeah, give me a call man. All right, I'll see you. Yep. Thank you. Yep.",

Oh, nice. Okay. Domino's. The Domino's driver has a car like mine. Does he? Yeah, but I think it's, is it a Chevy? Because Buick, well, it, like, looks like it, but I don't think it actually is the same car. But it's the same shape. Yeah. My lights are so nice. Why do you say that? They're nice and bright. They're nice and bright. Yeah. You should, you should get the fucking bright bulbs. They are the bright bulbs. What do you mean? You mean, like, you sound like. If they were any, if they were any brighter, they'd be, like, the brights. Turn my brights on for a second. Oh, yeah, it just lights it up more, because it's, like, just one. And then when you turn my brights on, it's a whole headlight. Yeah. But they're the same brightness, honestly. So, but you didn't purchase these headlights? I didn't purchase. No, they came with the car. Oh. Oh, yeah. I remember the guy was like, ooh, that's nice. Obviously, his job. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Maybe these are the expensive headlights.

Like, if it's going to be November 1st, and they're going to pull me over, like, hey, what's up? I think they give you, I mean, like, even though they're expired, they give, they, like, give you, like, a month or something like that before they'll ticket you for it. So, like, come December, or, like, they'll still pull me over in November, they'll just be like, hey, you got to get those fucking tabs. Yeah. You can still get pulled over for it, but they're not going to, like, give you a ticket until, like, I don't know, it's like 30 or 60 days or something like that afterwards. Okay. Yeah, because I was trying to do it during this, baby, go away, during this tape period, but, what? I don't know. I'm thinking I'm going to have to wait until my next, my next check to get her tabs.

You just need to start one. Need to start one? No, like you asked me on your phone. He's like, which one do I click so that I don't read? Like I just... Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Where a gentleman had told me that they just go to turn off and then turn it back on. And that's what I did. Where it works, where I didn't... I don't even know what the fuck that is besides like a fucking... I've never seen that screen before. Yeah. Have you been pushing buttons like on your phone like... No. I tell you... No, I went to go plug it in and charge it. And the next thing I know, looking at it, that's what... That was not my fucking thing where the phone was being on yet. I don't even know how I did it. Where I'm guessing like fucking the power and up or down or all of them are being pushed or something. I don't even know how the fuck it happened. Yeah, that's usually how it happens. Okay. Where did you get your truck fixed? No, I mean, I don't know. Like I can't fucking get it to turn on. Like I'm trying to like bypass the fucking interlock thing right now. Oh, shit. That might actually be something you have to bring in for them. Like you do that kind of stuff at all? I don't know. Well, the shitty thing is like if I pay them for a code like I normally would, then... And if it's not fixed, then I basically just paid them for no reason. Absolutely. Okay. Does that inhibit your fucking shit from even like starting? If you were to blow over, would your vehicle still start? If you were to blow and you had alcohol in your system? No, it wouldn't. It would say like a violation or something like that or fail. And it wouldn't. Okay. Where it doesn't even fucking turn on or engage? No. No. Well, right now it's in a lockout because like if you like have it towed... Like because there's a tracker in it too. And if it like figures out that it's like moving without being turned on, then they assume that it's being tampered with. So they fucking trigger a lockout. Now, can you call and inquire if they lock you out? It's just automatic. Like if you cut the power to the battery and like the device like doesn't have power, then it locks out. And you like move the vehicle without it being on, then it locks out. Okay. Then how do you get it going then after fucking with it? What do you mean? Well, I mean, if I wanted to pay that money... For when we towed it? If it was a lockout, it would take five days for it to happen. Okay. Well, it's bad for a week where... Yeah, I knew that it once... I knew that once after those five days, I wasn't going to be able to start it unless I had a code. Okay. But you don't know if that's what it is inhibiting it or not? I don't know. Yeah, I can't really tell because... Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Because basically, I tried jumping the starter and it's not like it's not working. So I don't know if I like fried my starter or what the deal is. I don't know. So I was just looking up how to tell just in case I'm like missing something. Okay. Are you back at home then? Yeah. What would the chance that Gabby will let you use your vehicle or ease up to a hundred bucks right now still trying to find a ride? I mean, I'm somewhat down, but I also am supposed to go grab for Dan. Right. Where I know listening to Doug last night, his cousin just keeps getting higher and higher and I don't know. He's getting fucking livid. Yeah. Yeah, but I can't really do anything less than a pound though. Right. Isn't that what he was looking for? I don't think so. Okay. But I don't know. You could ask him. No, I mean, Dan. Well, yeah. We're in that doing that. You probably ask him if you could fucking get whatever off of that, like for however you want to work it. So then start offering something to Doug where I know that he's starting to fucking look elsewhere. But I don't know what he has for options because with it being his cousin, it's fucking, I think that's been his primary goal too. Or when he doesn't have it, his cousin will take him to somebody else where at times that he gets here, that just holds up even more. Because then his cousin wants something out of it too. And the crazy part is the last time that fucking Doug Gate did like four zips, fucking he charged him like six. All right. Let me call you back. All right. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Hello. How's it going? How's it going? We got a cat today, a kitten. That's cool. He's really cute. You want me to send you a picture? Yeah. Okay. Un momento, por favor. Photos. Okay, I'll send you a few of them. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, I'll send you a few of them. And yeah, they're sent. Okay. So, I, like, have been keeping meaning to ask you about this, but I keep forgetting, but, like, the girl said you didn't know where their medication was when they came down here. So, they don't have it now? No, like, they, I asked them, like, right when they got here, and they're like, oh, I didn't know where it was. Well, yeah. Yeah. So, I, like, thought that I had it locked up in a box, and I was not correct about that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, then, I'm going to need you to bring their insurance cards down, because I'm going to need to bring them to the doctor to get refills, and Ashton wants to go to the chiropractor because her back's been really bothering her. Okay. We have Ava also, but, so, yeah, so, when I see you this weekend, maybe you could bring those. That would be helpful. For fizzle. What was I going to say? Are you looking at the cat? Yeah. Orange cat. Isn't he cute? Yeah. So cute. They, the girls, Gabby and Ashton, or Gabby and Ava were talking earlier, were, like, you should name him B3, because there's Big Brandon, Little Brandon, and Cat Brandon. I'm, like, no. Yeah. Little boy. I don't know. We haven't decided on a name yet, but I think it's a good one in the, but the girls don't like it as much as Tupac Shepur, or there's, or there's Purlock Holmes. No, I like the name Theo, like Theodore, or, but Ava doesn't like that one. Two of them like Atticus. Hold on, I got a speakerphone. Okay. All right. No, that's fine. And then, I don't know, we like Atticus, but it's, like, I don't, he's not giving me Atticus energy. Yeah. He's, like, shy and timid. Yeah. Yeah. But he's so cute. But we have him in the bathroom right now, because he's too overwhelmed being let into the wild yet. Let's see. I don't know. I basically, the most I want is basically about their medication, which, do they have any refills on them? So, I'm wondering if we could just get, like, if they do, if we could just get their medication refills, like, transferred to a pharmacy down here, without having to potentially go to the doctor? Yeah, I think so. I could, yeah. Can you check into that, and then let me know where, is it at Coburn's? No, it's, we go to the pharmacy that, in Willia, so, I mean, you'll have to tell me a pharmacy that you want it transferred to, and then I'll have to tell them that. Okay. Because usually, the pharmacy you're transferring it to contacts them, I believe, at least how I've always done it, but. Usually what now? Usually the pharmacy you're transferring it to, they will contact the pharmacy and get it transferred. Yeah. Yeah, but you got to tell me which, which pharmacy to contact, though. I guess. Let me see. I don't, I guess we could do Walgreens, but they're fucking always closed, I feel like. Oh, maybe Hy-Vee. Okay. Actually, I don't know. Let me think. What's fucking around here? Maybe. How about Walmart North Pharmacy? That would be good. Walmart North Pharmacy, that's, we have those two Walmarts in Rochester, but it's the third Okay. Let me write that shit down. Did he? Oh, he loves you. So, what's it called now? I know, I see it. Walmart North Pharmacy. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Walmart North Pharmacy. It's 3455th Street, Northwest Rochester. And the song. 3455th Street. Yeah, 3455th Street, Northwest Rochester. And then the phone number is 507-280-7665. I flashed the laser, like on the little creek and he ate it and he sniffed it and then he ate it. I did it to his food too, he ate it. Really? I think that's the new tactic. Maybe he's blind. I actually kind of think he might be a little bit because like when I was flashing the light, like he couldn't see like forward, he was like, like, like I like flashed the laser and he would move it and then he wouldn't see it move. Didn't you already have a snack? Because we're going to be eating dinner soon. I don't know yet, but I don't want you to get full on a snack. Okay, so that's probably good. Have like an apple sauce or like a scoop of yogurt or something if you're wanting more, but don't eat a Pop-Tart right now because I don't want you to be full for dinner. I'm telling you, you will be if you eat that. You never want to eat dinner. You always just want snacks, sweetie pie. And I want you to get some healthy food in you. I love you though. Don't tell me you love me like that. Like you're really lying. So anyways, things are going good here. I had to go buy like an $80 mattress pad for Ava today though, because the futon thing I got her, the mattress sucks on it. So I got a mattress topper. I hope she says it makes it better, but everything's so fucking expensive. Like everything, light bulbs. I just spent $12 for one light bulb today. That's crazy. Yeah, it is a smart light bulb, but I got one that you don't need like an app or anything. It's just a remote, which is cool, but it was like $12. $12. And then, yeah, it's just, it's been stressful. Like it's not having anything and everything I need, I have to like buy. So it's just, you know, financially it's like a little stressful, but it'll be good once everything's all, you know, we're a little bit more situated in. Yeah. Yeah, but it's been really good having the kids here. Like I feel not so lonely. Like it's really nice coming home from work and like having my family here, you know? Yeah, we can. How about we do it after dinner, like a little bit after dinner, but like not too close to bed. That's good. I miss you dad. I miss you too. Sorry. What? She said liar. I don't know why. The girls want to fucking go to have Indian food tonight. And I'm like, dude, I don't know if I can afford to go out to eat tonight, but I think we might just have to do something at home. Yeah. Yeah. Don't be afraid to play the Smackdown. Be like, nah, we ain't eating Indian food. I don't even know. Just try to get like work on your like Debo voice. No fool. What are you saying now? What are you saying now? What do you mean? You're just supposed to say something. Well, I don't know. They're pretty good for me. Like, I mean, for the most part, like they're respectful and like listen and stuff. The only thing that stresses me out sometimes is they get like fucking like the zoomies late at night. Also, they get all fucking ramped up and wild and like, what is happening? They've been pretty good about like helping out. Like when I asked them to clean up or like, you know, stuff like that. So it's been nice. I know that's right. And they've been getting along with each other pretty well too, which has also been nice, but. Yeah. It was a fluke. I give it six months. Yeah. I don't know. They have their second day of school today. I had lovely. I had the day off because I have like, they wouldn't let them do therapy at school. Like they said, they don't have anywhere for them to do it. So I had to, I dropped off Ella, brought Ashton home to do therapy because she went in to ask if they could do it there. And they said no. So then I brought her back and she did therapy. Then I brought her back to school and then I had to go back and pick up Ella at two or like quarter to two because she had therapy at two and then go back at 315 to pick up Ashton from school. I'm like, what the fuck? Yeah. Yeah. So I don't know how that's going to continue working. Cause like, if like, I don't always have the day off, I can't be going back and forth to pick them up from school like that. You know what I mean? Yeah. So we're going to have to kind of figure something out or I don't know. Both of them have keep saying they don't want to go to therapy anymore, but I don't know. Like I told him I would talk to you about it cause I don't really know what your thoughts are on that. Um, I mean, I'm not like opposed to it, like, but I, I guess my thoughts would be if they did stop going, it would be kind of like a trial basis. And if they start like feeling like they need like someone to talk to, or they're like starting to have like issues, like emotionally and stuff that we would find them another one down here. Um, I think fuck that just because they're with you doesn't mean that they don't have to like continue like their little learning journey. Like you have to, you have to like kind of consider like right now our biggest fear as far as far as them going is they don't know how to make the right set of friends. Like they'll friend just about anybody, even if it is like a crackhead. Ashton. No, I know. I mean, I agree that I think that they, yeah, I know what you're saying. Do you want to like, you want to fucking have them not do therapy just because they asked you for it? No, I just said I would talk to you about it and I didn't say one way or the other. I just, they brought it up. So I'm bringing it up to you. But, um, I do think though that we should find someone maybe down here then because it's kind of unrealistic for me to, they can't miss school once a week and they can't, it's not realistic for me. Oh shit. I had fucking my group today. I totally forgot to go to it. They can't miss school once a week. Why can't they? Miss school once a week, every week. That's like a lot of absences, Brandon. Not like all day long, but like. Right. But I can't, I don't always have Tuesdays off. So like, I can't just realistically pick, like do what I did today every week. Right. That's where we have medical cabs, but that's for like, if they're, they're like seeing somebody down there. Right. That's what I'm saying that I, I don't, that we're going to have to find someone down here. I didn't say that was the first thing I said. Because the, but yeah, I need to, if they're going to keep doing it, I need to find someone down here because it's not realistic for me to have to go back and forth like that because I work some days. Elude3-yes-run. So, yeah, I will look into finding some children therapists around here. And we can talk about it more and see what, like, what your thoughts are on, like, where we should go. Or if you want to, you're welcome to look too. They don't, they don't have a space for them to do therapy. There is what they said. They don't have a room or an office or somewhere that they can do therapy, which I think is crazy, but. Is that was like the plan? That's why I was bringing them this morning and I kind of, it was just, it's been a little like, whatever, a little bit. I don't know. I don't know if I can say that I would be happy to be a therapist. I'm not saying that it's fine. I'm not saying that it's fine. Because I don't work until 11 ever. After school, like today, most days I can pick them up. But yesterday I had to have my friend Akalo pick them up because I had to work a double and there was no way I could go pick them up from school. And I didn't want them to have to walk, you know, like when it's not that cold out, it's like worst case scenario. I wouldn't mind having them walk, but like in the wintertime, that's way too far for them to walk in the cold. Yeah. Yeah, that's a bummer. Yeah, but I mean, I have friends down here that are like good people that would help me out. I'm not like, it's just one more thing that is kind of like, it's an inconvenience more than anything, you know. Yeah, yeah, I know what that's like. Yeah, but I have to bring them to the office and get, actually, we should probably go do that right now before the lady's gone for the day. Because I need to get them their own set of keys. Well, I guess actually we can do it tomorrow probably because Ava's here this week. So it's not like super imperative because she can let them in when I'm, if I'm at work. It's going to be a lot of getting the key. But yeah, that's all I got. I was just calling to kind of check in, I guess. I got you. I'll allow it. Yeah, no. That's crazy. Yeah, no. I don't know, dude. Yeah, so you want me to call? Rude, I want to fucking call that school and be like, really, motherfuckers? Ain't got no fucking, what are you guys like? Is it like a small-ass school? Like, what is their, what is their, do they just like, do you just not? It's a big school. I think that they're like overly, like not crowded, but they have a wide variety of students there. Yeah. I mean, cause it sounds like somebody, I mean, that's like the response I would expect if they were like trying to punk you. Like, no, we don't have rooms here. They didn't say they don't have rooms. They just don't have an extra one for them. But they might as well have said that. I know. I agree. But I mean, I sent Ashton in to talk to them because I was in the pick, in the, in the room with them. Cause I was in the pick, in the parking lot. So, I mean, I guess I could call and see if that's like, if they didn't give her the correct information or something. Who did you talk to this morning? Was it the front desk lady or was it the counselor? It was one of the front desk ladies. Okay. Okay, I'll call the, I'll call the counselor tomorrow and talk to her. See? Okay. And then go from there, I guess. I thought she talked to her counselor this morning when she went in there. But that, yeah, but so that makes it a little more, um, a different variable. So, I'll follow up with her tomorrow and go from there, I guess. Okay. Um. All right. Well, um, but yeah, if you could follow, if you could call the pharmacy and get their refills transferred over so we can get their meds started again. And, um, and yeah, if you want to look into a therapist, I'll look too. And we can kind of meet back with that later or something. The rapist. What? That's how therapist is spelled. The rapist. That's crazy. Actually, that's spelled, that's the word. Yeah. You got me on fucking speaker phone. Yeah. Fucking cop. You always have me on speaker phone. That's different. Oh, I forgot. Oh, yeah. All right. I gotta go eat. All right. Yeah, I'm gonna go get some food too for them. So. Oh, yeah. I'll see you. All right. Bye. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hello? Hey, what are you doing? Uh, nothing. I'm at home. That was Gabby? No. Oh. Do you know if Gabby works today? Yeah, she does. Yeah. Does she work, like, all day? Yeah. All the business hours, I mean. Yeah, I don't think she gets off until, like, four. Dakota fucking stole, went and hit my storage. You know, like, my paperwork shit in there, you know? Mm-hmm. She fucking stole all my car titles, dude, and her title is actually already signed. Yeah, but isn't it signed by you, though? No, it's signed by her. She signed it when I got it from her or whatever because I was supposed to transfer it. Yeah. And I feel like a piece of shit because I have enough money to go get all the new car titles. The title for my truck, the title for my dad's truck, and then the title for the car. Mm-hmm. I have $80 total, and it's something that I want to do before he can just up and transfer them out of my name and fucking literally, like, legally take them from me. But I fucking don't have the money to transfer it, and I feel so bad because I know every time I have a situation like this, I tell her, I'm like, I'll transfer it next time, I promise. Yeah. I need somebody to work their magic, okay? Well, I got that little piece of paper that came from the title. What I could do is turn that into the DMV, and that'll, like, if he tries to transfer the title, then it'll, like, come up as, like, invalid or something like that because... I asked them about that, and they said, no, you have to get a different title. You have to go get a new title for them. They won't even flag it. I even tried to make a police report because he's got all my fucking car titles, you know? He's got every car title except for the one for Jess's car, you know? And, fucking, I tried to tell them that I wanted to do that, and I even tried to call and make a police report about it so if it gets transferred out of my name that he would be held responsible. They wouldn't even do that. They said, you just have to go get a new title. Yeah. I suppose you pay for a duplicate title and then fast-track it. Yeah. No, you just have to get a new one, they said. They said, as long as you get a new title, that one will be deactivated. I have enough money for all the titles, but I don't have enough money to transfer it, and I don't think that she'll do it for me because that last time I told her that I would transfer it out of her name when I got the tabs. It's not like I'm fucking doing anything. I'm not transferring it for any kind of reason. I don't have the $60 to transfer it right now. Not only that, but here's another thing why I don't want to transfer it. I'm about to divorce Dakota, and he's going to try to come after me for half of my vehicles in my name. So I'm making my dad, that's why I have to go get new titles also, because I'm making my dad fucking take his cars out of my name until the divorce is finalized because I don't want Dakota to be like, oh, well, she has four cars in her name, I want two of them. You know what I mean? Yeah, that could be a thing. So there is kind of a reason behind it why I don't want to transfer it yet, but I don't want to risk him signing that title over into his name because then he can literally just show up in my house and tell the cops that I stole his car and they'll take me to jail. Yeah, or at least tow it out of there and take it away from you. Huh? Yeah, or he could at least tow it away and take it away from you. Yeah, legally take it from me, literally. Yeah. I don't want to risk anything happening like that, but I don't know who else's name I can put it in for right now. I mean, I could put in my dad's name, but he's not valid, so I'll get fucked with all the time. Yeah. And I don't really have the money to transfer it anyway, so I need you to help me work your magic and sweet talk her. Yeah. I mean, I guess the hard part is getting her to a DMV during business hours. Yeah. Brandon, take one for the team here, okay? Yeah. I don't know what else to do. I'm taking all the cars out of my name, all of them, and it all starts with getting all these titles, but hers isn't in my name, so that's kind of like a good thing in a way. Right, right. You know, this would be the vehicle that he would try to come after me for, because this was the one that he was taking to work. You know? It would be this one in my truck that he'd try to come after me for, but I'm waiting to file for the divorce until my dad gets his two out of my name, which I told him he has to do it by next week, and I told him I'd supply the titles since I lost them all. Yeah. That was my pitch in for it, and then they would have to transfer it over to my name. Well, yeah. If you can get Gabby the money to transfer it to get a duplicate, then I'm sure I can talk her into this. I mean, what I could do, too, is I could even fill out, yeah, she said I could even fill out the duplicate title form and write a little note saying she can come pay for the title, and then whatever, it'll get mailed to her. I don't know how long that takes, though. Like four to six weeks? That might be better because then I would have a reason to say that I can't transfer it yet. Yeah. You know? Right. I don't know. I didn't know if she was up yet or if she was already at work or something, so I didn't want to call her. I figured I'd call you. Yeah. Yeah, she left for work like a half hour ago. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I'll just do that. I'll fill out the duplicate title form. What is her current address, though? Because I want to make sure that her address is up to date so it gets sent to the right address. I'll text her to you. Okay, yeah. Yeah, it has to already be set in their system up to date or whatever, so I fucking… Right. But, yeah, then I'll just do that, and I'll text her and let her know and stuff, and then when it comes in the mail, then she can… By then, I don't know how long… How long does the divorce take? You've been divorced before. Yeah, it depends. We don't have any assets. Right. Or kids, right? We don't have no… We've got a kid together. So I guess the thing is… Yeah, but he's registered. He's registered, and he's going to terminate his rights. Oh. You should be able to go through it, and you might be able to get it all taken care of for less than $300 or $400. I'm going to get a county state covered attorney. Are you kidding me? I'm going to fucking Hennepin County to tell them that I… That's what my mom did, she said. Yeah. I'll still have to pay, I think, the filing fee, but it's not much, though, either. But it's a free lawyer. There's nothing to split up between us. This should be something that we can just sign a paper and be done. There's nothing to split, because there's going to be no cars in my name. Right. Yeah, for you, it was pretty quick. Yeah. I don't know, but… Yeah, this should be hopefully quick, so maybe by the time the title gets there, it'll be done. But I can't even file for it until a week from now. I promised Dad that I'd give him a week to get his cars out of my name. Otherwise, I'm going to do it. I don't care. You know what I mean? You guys are going to be screwed. I don't know what else to tell you. I'm paying for the titles since I lost them, and you guys can pay to get them out of my name. And I'll even put them back in there once it's done, but, you know. Yeah. I don't know, it's a shit show. I'm moving up to my mom's tomorrow. Oh, really? Yep. It's like over by Brainerd? Huh? Outside of Brainerd? No, up in Palisades, past Aiken. Oh, yeah, yeah. Remember where you always used to pick me up from? Yeah. Yeah, that house. Yeah, I'm back there. I have to be out of my grandpa's by the 31st, and I don't have anywhere else to go. So, last resort. Yeah. Yeah. That was a nice place, though. Huh? That was a nice place, though. No. No, it's not. It's not going to last long. Yeah, I can feel it. But, it's going to have to work out for right this second. Yeah. Dakota called CPS on me. I had to get an OFP on him and everything. Really? Yeah, he called CPS on me and reported that, because my dad, that day that he ran down the road with the baby, my dad beat his ass, but he had a video of it, and he had the baby in his arms and shit. So, Dakota reported domestic violence to him and the baby. Yeah. Yeah, I had to meet with CPS about that. I said, listen, he attacked me and then tried to kidnap my child. And my dad went to any, did what any other parent in their right mind would do. This man tried to kidnap my child, and he's a registered sex offender. I played that card, you know? Yeah. I was like, how would you feel if you watched a registered sex offender run down the road with your child? Right. I played that card, and she was like, well, the domestics and the abuse that's happening in this situation is unsafe for the baby. I was like, OFP, I'll get one right now. Yeah. Yep, I had to go get an OFP on him. Yep. And, guess what I got? What? The paperwork for his sex case. Oh, really? That little lying ass bitch. Okay. What does it say? Oh, my God. Brandon, you're never going to look at him the same. You're never going to even look at me the same, because I married him. But I didn't even know this until after I married him, in my defense. Yeah. Oh, I'm missing a tear right now. Oh, shit. You're going to shit your pants and never look at him the same. I won't. He fucking lied to me. He made it sound so different. Yeah, which is kind of a common thing. Huh? Which is kind of a common thing I've heard. Dude, I... Oh, my God. She said, the child victim described his genitals as warm and slimy. What the fuck? I don't know. That's fucked up. Dude, that's so funny. I don't care what anybody says. That's fucking hilarious. I'm sending it to you on Messenger right now. Yep. He's a liar. That was definitely not... He did not... That's not how that went down. How he told me it did. That's a damn lie. He said he was 16, too, and he was 17. That's weird. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Uh. Oh, my God. God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. So what did he tell you? He told me that she was 13 and that he was 16 and that it was consensual happened one time. And then he said that two years later, he robbed his brother's for some weed. And the girl was like his brother's girlfriend stepsisters and shit like that. And he robbed his brother for some weed. And then she made the report or whatever. But he said it was consensual. It was just because she was 13 and he was 16. Supposedly. Isn't that fucked up? Yeah. Like, first of all, no, I don't care. She came out about that shit a couple months later. But, like, no. His dates are all sorts of different things. That's fucked up. Yeah. I don't care what anybody says. That's fucking disgusting. How did he say that he knew her? Huh? How did he say that he knew her? It was his step. It was his brother's girlfriend's stepsister. Oh. Yeah. And then he claimed when he robbed his brother for the weed or whatever that she made the report. That's a damn lie. She came out about that shit like only a couple months later. He said it was like two years later. Yeah. I don't know. I just think that's fucked up. But I'll let you get back to me. What do you got going on the rest of the day? Huh? What do you got going on the rest of the day? Um, I, uh, just. Nothing really, I guess. Hmm. I'm going to go to the DMV and get the titles that are in my name situated and paid for. Now I have a little bit of money. And then I got to make a load up to my mom's later. Yeah. What vehicle are you driving? Um, I was going to take my truck probably. I don't know. Yeah, I was going to take my truck. I have to pull a trailer, an enclosed trailer. A friend of mine is going to let me use this trailer for it. And, uh, yeah. Hmm. I don't know. I could use my dad's trailer, but like his isn't my friend or whatever. It's his, it's his works trailer, but it's enclosed. So I feel like it'll be easier. I have a lot of little boxes because I went to the liquor store and got like every box. They had it there because I didn't have no boxes. So all my boxes I have are like little liquor store boxes. Yeah. Yeah. I packed my whole room in like little ass liquor store boxes. I don't know. I just feel like they're going to, it's going to be a hassle putting it on dad's trailer and trying to strap it all down. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what's going to be shitty. It's going to be a long day, but I want to get these titles and shit out of the way. That way I'm not stressed out about him illegally stealing my truck. Right. Right. I don't care what anybody says. I will blow that bitch up. If I can't have it, nobody can have it. They will find that bitch in the bottom of the river. Promise you. Right. I don't care. I'll be that way. Yeah, I get it. All right. All right. Well, yeah. Give me a call and I'll see how soon Gabby can get to the DMV. I don't know if she'll be able to do it today. Are they open on Saturday? I think they are. Does she work on the weekends? Yeah, she usually works on Saturday, but I don't think they're open on the weekends. Okay. I know she scheduled the day with me last week too, and I failed to make it. So it's my fault. Yeah. Just ask her about it. Okay. Thank you. I really appreciate it. All right. Good luck. I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.

How are you doing? I'm okay. How are you? I'm doing okay. So the reason I was calling was I recently submitted a form for reduced fees in the ignition interlock program. Please let me stop you right there. It is one department above this that's trained in ignition interlock. I'd like to transfer you towards the front of their line. But can I also offer you that correct phone number in case you end up with any further questions for them later? Yeah. Okay. What is that number? 651-296-2948. Okay. And I can transfer you towards the front of their line if you're ready. Yeah, I'm ready. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good day. You too. Bye. Thank you. Bye. All of our agents are busy.

Yeah, it's Q007-103856-007. And your first name, last name, and date of birth, please? Brandon Gillis, G-I-L-L-E-S, and it's 12-15-86. Thank you. And how can I help this afternoon? One second. Yeah. So I submitted one of those forms along with some supporting documents about reduced fees for the ignition interlock program. I was just following up about that. When was that submitted to us? Was that earlier this year? Within the last week. Within the last week. Yeah, via email. That's why I'm not seeing anything on record yet because I haven't processed it on the record yet. We're still waiting to receive it on the record to where we can make a decision. When there is a decision, as long as you submitted the application and the acceptance letter or qualification letter of the benefit that you marked on there, you're going to be approved. But right now we're just waiting for that. You can bring it into the office and have them add it to your record, or you can upload it online to your record as well. I can upload it? Yes. How long would it take before it gets in front of you guys if it's just been emailed? About two weeks, possibly. Okay. But if I upload it, then it's available to you guys right away? Yeah, we can see it right away. And then it's in the queue for processing, and then we're just waiting for processing to approve the correct paperwork that we get. And then we mail you a letter that says, hey, you're approved with a fee breakdown on there. Contact the manufacturer that you're making payments to and have them update their pricing. Okay. But from the time you guys actually do receive it, it's still probably like another one or two weeks, just like the turnaround, right? Correct. Yep. Okay. All right. That's all I need to know then for now. Yeah, I think that's all I got. If you have questions later on, give us a call. We're here to help. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Bye.",

Yeah, yeah, yeah. So what you do is you take 169 to Elk River, and then once you get to Elk River, you'll see an exit for 101. And, you know, that's like, you know, just basically, um... Yeah, right, 101 is right in Elk River. And you might recognize it by then. But you take that exit, and then within five minutes, you're in Rogers.

Like, so you can tell me where to turn. Yeah, I'll send you a screenshot of your location and where it is. Okay. So, yeah, so I take 169 for sure for right now. You're right. Okay. All right. I'll talk to you soon. Bye. Bye.",

He is currently curled up in a ball under a cubby, but still making some noises to stay awake. Hopefully he'll fall asleep and we can move him to his car. We'll let you know in five minutes or so. And then I said, okay, thanks. And she says, nope, or no go. He's back up and running and loud. I'm so sorry, but he'll need to be picked up. So sorry. So I guess he's just running around during that time. Yeah. Okay. I don't know how to put him to sleep up there. And then I said, okay, thanks. And she said, nope, or no go.

Give them a, give me a ride or give me the keys. Right. I feel like he might be more comfortable giving you a ride, but I don't know.

    "transcript": "Uh, no, no, I'm not busy anymore. Uh, I was just looking at different fucking, uh, lifts. I really want to fucking get a lift. Yeah, I'd like to have one in my garage. Yeah dude, that'd be nice to have one in your garage. Maybe you should get one. You should get it. You know you should get one. Fifteen hundred dollars for one. Yeah. But I don't have the money to buy it. Yeah. Hmm. Quick question, um, do you want to help me put a head gasket on this car? Uh, yeah. How much do you want me to pay you? Yeah, uh. Like real shit. How much do you want me to give to you? Uh. I have all the specialty tools. I'm going to go buy the head gasket today. Yeah. Um. Dude, how many vehicles you got again and then which one you were trying to get rid of? Um. Well, I've gotten rid of one and I'm getting rid of another one today. So. Well, we got rid of one too. So I just got the one in the back, I got to fix the car and then I got the one that's the head gasket one. Okay. And then and then I'm going to look for a Ford. I was telling you about it's called Sport Track. Okay. I'm looking for one of those. Why? What do you need one of those for? For like the parts? No, I'm going to take the engine or transmission out of the one I got and look for one that's broken. Oh, I got you. Yeah. Um. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. I was talking with somebody about what I should do. Um. So you still. Well, I mean, because I know you got work that you're trying to do. Yeah. Um. If you still got that vehicle that you're you're willing to barter with. Um. Uh. I don't know. You could like put a value on that and then like. Uh. That's the one I got the engine out there for. Oh, you decided to just do the engine, not like just the. It may make it be fixed, but I mean, I went to the junkyard and bought a motor. So. You know. Yeah. It's like, well, I know that's a good engine that I pulled out of a car. The reason I know that because the top of the car was like damaged. Was not damaged. No, it was damaged. Like the whole top of the car was damaged. Like they hit something, like it peeled it back. I understand. It is that or they did it when they were moving it around. Which is possible. Yeah. Like they start the car on top of it. Or hit it or I don't know. Anything possible. Yeah. Yeah. I need a vehicle. And. Yeah. So I'm like, well, we need a bunch of work done. So and I got cars, which is good. So, yes, we got stuff I had to put together and make it happen. Yeah. Because I don't have, like, transportation, like, back and forth. Like, I'd probably have to make some sort of arrangement with you. I had a time like that. If you're still willing to barter with me about one of those cars like that. Like that first day, I'd be able to get that thing running. So I could basically leave by the time. Yeah. And then, like, basically, the amount of the value of that car would just get, like, worked out. As far as how much. I don't know. You know, basically, I don't know. You said, like, for example, I was thinking, like, if you have, like, do an engine swap. And this is just for an example. Like, and it's like, I can look up the labor time. Well, see, here's the thing. This is why I went and got the engine. That's the reason I went and got the engine, because that guarantees that car is going to be fixed. Because the parts are right out there. Yeah. You get what I'm saying? I mean, yeah. I know it ain't in the car. No, it's not in the car. But if we could fix my gray car, you could use that other car. I wouldn't even care. Like my car I'm driving? Yeah. I think it would be faster to put a head gasket in. Huh? I don't have a black one. I got rid of it. Oh. My black one's gone. Okay. I had two black ones. They're gone. Yeah. Well, yeah, so I don't know. What do you want to work out then? What do you want to do? The biggest problem I got is I've sold the last one for cheap money. Instead of $5,000 I should have got for it, I got $1,500. You know? That's kind of like a hit I took. And now I guess I'm going to sell this other one I have for $1,500. It's kind of a small hit I'm taking because I've spent time and effort and all. That's right. But also it relieves me of that responsibility of worrying about fixing the car. Yeah. It lets them take that responsibility. Right. But the problem is this red one out here might actually be good, man. The transmission was swapped in and I just can't get the hood open. But the problem is I already got someone coming on the way here to pick it up right now. Yeah. I was hoping you could have came over and we could have tried to open the hood on it. I mean, you can get inside the vehicle, can't you? Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's too late. The guy's on the way here. He's driving here now. Yeah. I probably wouldn't be able to get there tonight anyways. It's fine, dude. It's fine. Like I said, it frees up a couple of dollars for me to buy the head gasket, oil, you know, shit for this other car. Yeah. Give my girlfriend some money for some bills or something. Yeah. Give you some gas money, but you said you don't have a car. Oh, shit. Right. Yeah. If I were to come out there, I'd probably be like... What's going on with your truck? I thought you said you had the car ready. Well, I fucking... I had it all put it back together and everything. And then I fucking... Yeah, the transmission went bad in it right away. Like I went to... Oh, it's a bad transmission. Yeah. Yeah. I went to go... Then you had to take it back out. Yeah. So I got to take it back out. I haven't done that yet. I'm just like kind of just depressed and... Yeah, that's like annoying as fuck because that's a lot of work. I mean, since I already got it, like, I don't know. It's just, yeah, it sucks because now I got to take it out and then I got to go switch it out for a different one. Yeah. And you got only so many days to do that. So you really need to get on top of that. Right. Honestly, they only give you a 30 day return. Yeah. I got to go all the way out to fucking Wilmer to switch it out because that's where I got it from. Yeah. Well, yeah. I'm going to check on Jaden. See if his crazy stuff is going on. Hope he's in the room and watching his tablet and not fucking acting crazy. Yeah. Doing crazy shit like flooding the house or leaving the doors open on the refrigerator or building, taking all the couch cushions off and throwing them in the floor. Yeah, my kids do that. Yeah. I wish I was his age, man. We'd have a lot of fun, but I'm not. Yeah. I play with him as much as I can, but it's got limitations. Yeah. Dude, my fucking kid got kicked out of daycare today. The fucking daycare called us and they're like, yeah, you got to come and pick his ass up. He's being too much. I was like, damn. It seemed like he's being good. Oh, that's good. So you said he got kicked out of daycare, huh? Yeah, for the day. Huh? Yeah, he got kicked out of there for the day.",

Yeah no that's good I was kind of wondering the same thing about you. I was thinking I was going to come over tomorrow. Are you going to be around? Yeah. I'll probably be on my way out there kind of early because I only have like I don't know until basically like I don't know dark to do whatever. Okay so worst case scenario I gotta take you home. Well no I think Gabby will. I don't mind it if that's what needs to happen. I mean it's fun. Yeah I suppose we can cross that bridge when we get there but as for now yeah I know that I'll be able to get a ride out there tomorrow and have my stuff with me. We should have a game plan on what we're doing. Yeah yeah which is what I was thinking. Yeah it's good you're still awake. So what are you thinking? You gonna tackle that head gasket? Yeah I mean that'd be great but what did you figure out about your truck? I gotta pull the transmission out of there that I put in and then I gotta go switch it out with a different one and yeah I just need like I don't know. Do you feel like you should I mean do you feel like that you got a very limited window to return that I mean do you want me to come help you take that out? I mean I should be fine. I just I just just been kind of fucking irritated with the whole thing because I was under there for a while. Sure I know it's a lot of work. I mean now that I got it like I don't know all up in the air and and like already like put it took it apart and put it back together once like you know taking it back out again is relatively like easy. I know it's like I can like it annoys the fuck out of you doesn't it? Yeah. It's like like they it's like you feel like they betrayed you by giving you something that's garbage honestly. Yeah and now it's like now I don't know who I can trust like do I spend more money doing this or do I fucking go back and do what I originally planned on doing? No I hear you. My opinion would be to try to take that out and return it and tell them they got to make damn sure they give you one that's good. Right. They can't be giving you some shit that's broken. Right. In a way that's like taking the burden off of them trying to figure out if it's good or bad and throwing it on the customer. Yeah I mean and the guy did like anticipate that already too because he said he's like you know if it's not good you know just bring it back and I'll switch it out I mean he said that. Well yeah but it's easy for them to switch it out they're not the one putting it in and out of the car. I know dude that's why that's why I'm kind of pissed I'm like I should fucking make him pay me you know. Especially if you're paying a shop to do this shit oh my god. Right. Because they're damn sure not gonna take it out and switch it for you for free. I know well but Simon what do you want to and I think today's okay yeah so tomorrow's yeah so tomorrow's Wednesday so that means I can I can fuck with you all day long tomorrow but then the following day I gotta pull out that transmission because on Friday is when I'm going to bring it back and switch it out. Okay well it would be cool to like work on these cars right but also on the other hand I need to work on that tree over there at the Blaine house. Yeah I don't have a chainsaw. I got one. Yeah is it a nice one or is it fucking. Oh it's a piece of shit I'm talking about oh my god you gotta paint that motherfucker over about a billion times before it might think about running. That's terrible. But when it runs it runs. Matter of fact it runs so much you barely can turn it off. It just keeps running. Really? Like wide open all gas and no brakes. Oh really? Don't set it down. Something to do with the throttle or something? There ain't one. Oh that's crazy. It's all wired straight up. Wow did you do that yourself? No that's the way it came. It's missing covers. I got it for free. Oh. It's missing all you know. There's no oil in it either so if it gets hot you let it cool off. Wow. I mean in that case I'd probably buy one then. I know that sounds crazy as fuck doesn't it? No I got a good one. I got a good one. It's not a pile. Yeah. It's alright. I did buy quite a few of them until I actually got a good one. Yeah. I mean honestly if we were to do that tree thing tomorrow I wouldn't even I would suggest not even bringing a chainsaw anyways. I would suggest you know tying it off. You know I've got like I've got like a come along and. Oh bro I mean I'm gonna have to go rent a lift. Like we're gonna rent a lift and go and literally go and put a lift and cut the tree and make it safe and yeah. You should have taken a couple of pictures so I could see what you're talking about. Oh well I got one. So I can find it right quick. Man that means I need to get this trailer unloaded too. Shit. Well I guess I'll do it here in a minute. Because there's another. I need to have this trailer unloaded so I can haul that shit away. Yeah. Oh you got it? Oh I mean let me check. Oh no it says sending. So it's sending to you. You haven't received. So I was thinking if I rent a lift I could cut this big tree down. I can cut quite a few trees around here. You know what I mean? Yeah. With a lift you know because I'm renting it and I can just I can move it around a yard with a truck. Because they'll kind of tow behind the truck. Yeah. It's like $350. Okay. It's the cheapest one I could find. Yeah. But how high up do you need to go? I think I need to go 60 feet. Oh my god. Dude that's I wouldn't fucking want to go up that high. Oh I don't have a problem with it. Yeah but I don't mind it. Yeah. I mean you've seen that house that I lived in before. I had to. I'm fucking mad at that guy. That shit is dangerous. No doubt. It's very highly dangerous. Yeah dude that shit's like twice as 60 feet. That's like twice as high as that house. Well I don't know. 60 feet is the height of a tree line. If you look outside and look at the high trees that's 60 feet. Oh I think I just got it. No it's just offscending or something. Oh here we go. Yeah. Yeah dude. I would ratchet that thing. I'll do it. Well here's the thing. I climbed the tree and I put a rope in it already. I was going to cut the top out you know and then I was going to like I had a rope already rigged up and everything and someone was going to hold it on the ground. When I cut it it was all like you know what I mean. So you've been holding on to like that top piece basically. Yeah. Not like the whole thing but you know where the Y is at the top right corner. The whole piece there going up into the whole. So yeah. And then there would have been a secondary cut and then you know it's all undone. Right. But yeah but there's some other trees around that I want to cut too. So it's not the only one. That's not. There's some in the back that requires a lift because there's no way to get up get the tree and cut it unless you have a lift in the back because it's growing from the other people's property over hours and I want to cut the tops out. You know what I'm saying. It's growing over other people's property. It's growing. The trees are growing from the other people's property next door and it's growing over into our property and I want to cut the tops of the trees out. It's growing over big limbs growing over into the back because I planted a bunch of fruit trees behind this house. Yeah. So I already cut down quite a few trees around there but I want to knock this one down and there's a really big one in the front. I'm going to take that one. I need a lift to get up there and cut some limbs out of it. Yeah. So I'm saying so there's like a there's a need for it. I gotcha. But all this cutting requires a lot of cleaning up. So. Yeah definitely. It's a lot of cleaning up actually. And a matter of fact if you're going to help I actually have someone else lined up that can help too tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. Yeah. I mean. Yeah. Yeah. I got a guy that could come and help too. Hard ass worker. Well the problem is I can't really. I mean I don't mind giving you some money. I might give him like his other friend. I can't give everybody money. You know what I mean. Yeah. That's the problem. Right. Yeah. I wish I could. I mean. All right. Well you got to you got to figure out if you want to do this tree thing or if you want to do the head gasket thing because if if you do want to do the head gasket thing then I got to load up my tools tonight. I wish I could have talked to Linda more about this because I would because I'm going to use her car to rent the lift. Yeah. But. Yeah. What you said that you said on Thursday that you're going to work on a truck and you're going to go back and regroup and. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. On Thursday I had to go. I had to make sure that the tranny is out of the truck. And like in the back of my. In the back of the car. So that on Friday morning I. We can leave early as fuck and. Go. Go on that journey to replace it. Yeah. It'll be a fun journey because I won't get out of three hours. No it's like. It's like an hour and a half two hour drive. No I'm talking about from getting it out. Oh. Um. Well. Probably probably not that long actually. I could probably get it back out in like. Maybe like an hour. Just because I've got all the tools. And I already know all the tools that I need. And have all the extensions and everything. Like already set up. Set aside. One fucking thing is. Is my my fucking little magnet light. My kids were in my bedroom. The other day. And like they fucking found it. My little magnet light. And then they like walked off with it. And I haven't been able to fucking find it since. Damn really? Yeah I fucking tore this house apart. Looking for it too. That's fucked up. Yeah. Because I'm. I definitely fucking need. I mean I got like one light. Or as convenient as that magnet one. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. You want to talk to Linda. Or maybe I should. Should I just plan to like load the tools up in the morning. Or. Um. I mean I got a lot of tools. I'm fairly confident. That I've got enough tools. To work on the car. You really think I don't? I would hate to be there. And like not have something. It would be nice if we could get this done in one day. That would be great. Yeah. You haven't started it? I haven't started it. It's still in running driving condition. Okay. And I got some really big ramps. To put it on. Car ramp jacks or whatever. I got some extra large ones. That's good. I got a big jack now. Yeah. That's good. I'm jealous. It's definitely super luxurious. To have it like. It's just like jack. Yeah. This is like the necessities. To even work on a car. You know what I mean. I was there with a fucking scissor jack for the longest. Yeah. I got a hydraulic jack. But they're both like two ton jacks. Which is like not the biggest. It's like. Yeah. Technically I shouldn't be using it to lift up the truck. Like I mean I can. But like only like a quarter of the vehicle. Basically. Yeah. I mean that's what they say anyways. I fucking picked up the front end of it. The other day. It was just really hard. Hey. He goes ahead and uses it anyways. Yeah. I'm just like super cautious. Because I fucking. I like. I had like my truck up on jack stands. And all jacked up once. And I was in my buddy's like yard. And fucking that was like. And that thing ended up like falling down. Not on me. But like I was like a couple feet away. And I had just recently been under there. Damn. And then the thing fell down. How did it fall down? Because I wasn't on like concrete. I was on gravel. Oh. Sure. You didn't have the solid underneath it. Yeah. So like now seeing that. And kind of having that little bit of phobia. Like I'll never let that shit happen again. I'll never fucking. Like when I put it up. I'll like. You know you do the test. And if I can fucking like check that thing. And like rock that thing at all. With my body. Then like. I don't know. That's just you got to give it a test. Because I know that if I can fucking like. Put all my weight into it. And like basically go to the trailer hitch. Or something like that. And like fucking basically try to tip it over. And if I can't make it tip over. Then it passes the test. I can tell you those big jack stands I got. You ain't finna fit anything to move. So. It ain't moving. Once you set it on there. It ain't moving. That's good. Like pretty large. That's good. I mean they're for a truck. Yeah. I don't know. I mean I got them from Harbor Freight. So they have different ones. And I just got the large one that I got. Oh the six ton one. Probably. Yeah. I was just on Harbor Freight last night. Looking at stuff. You know I was expecting to see all the prices. Of everything on every shelf everywhere. Go like sky high. But I haven't seen that happen yet. Yeah. Well. Well think about it. Everything is from everywhere. Okay. Yeah. And if that's the case. Then that means there's a tariff associated. With that product to be brought here. Yeah that's why some things. Some things are like. Yeah. Because the tariffs and all that. Right. And people have been getting bills. That are tariff bills in the mail. From ordering shit. Did you know that? Yeah. Yeah I know that the vapes. That I usually smoke. They're apparently from fucking China. Which I didn't know. And so for a while. We couldn't get the vapes. To use. Because the fucking company. Went out of business. Damn. And you had to like change up. Yeah. Well actually. Yeah I did change it. The brand or whatever. But like. I think that's what the company did. I think they fucking just changed their. Their logos and all that shit. And then they kept on doing production. They're actually the same ones. But. Don't you just love. The planet. How it all operates. Yeah I know. Not even the country. It's the planet. Everybody operates like that. File bankruptcy. Start a new business. New business name right away. Yeah. So. Alright. I'm. Damn it makes me think. We should be working on cars tomorrow then. I guess. I don't know. At least we know what we're doing. You know what I mean. I did tell that other person. I'm going to be having him help me tomorrow though. But that doesn't guarantee me. He's going to be ready to go. I'll have to go pick him up too. Alright. Yeah he don't have a car. Oh I see. He's in St. Paul. Yeah. But that shit doesn't need to happen though. Over there. But it can happen next week too. If you have any availability. I mean. I can make some time. You'd probably be better off next week. Coming over because you'd have your truck. In theory. Why are you saying theory? I don't know. Like I was saying. I don't fucking trust. I don't trust where I'm getting it from. I don't trust that it's the next one. I'm going to get is going to be good. I mean. It's like this. They gave you one. I don't know if it's good or bad. So I'm giving one to you. You come back with it's bad or good. Then they go okay. We'll give you a good one this time. We know it's good. Yeah. That's really the best way. To find out if one's good or bad. Is to put it in the vehicle and find out. I mean you can bench. You can do a couple different things. To bench test it. Right I get that. You don't set shit up like that. To make it see if it's working. Right yeah. I mean you can do like certain things. But it requires disassembling a little bit. I mean the easiest thing to do. Is like to take that. That down shaft. And like switch it from. And switch the. The gear from like park. Because when it's in park. It should be like totally locked up where you can't. It won't spin left or right. And then like. In every gear besides park. Like it should spin freely. In one direction. And then like be kind of sluggish in the other. And then like. If you take the valve body off. You can like. Do like an air check. Air test. Like with an air hose. Where you're like. You're like spraying air. Into like the different little ventricles. Like the air goes through it for a second. And then like the little marble. Catches. And it's like. You hear like a big pop. And it needs to do that. For every little ventricle. That you test. And there's like I think like six of them. Yeah I don't know. It also really fucking helps. That I got like that digital manual for it now. The truck anyways. Which I'd recommend. Getting the digital manual. For this thing with the head gasket too. Oh how much is that? It's 30 bucks. For the year. Oh do you get to look at any car? No. You have to pay for it by. So here's the thing. So like I found two different resources. Like one is like a pirated resource. Where like some like. Some I don't know. Just got together and they like compiled. All of like the data. That I'm paying for. Into like one website. And. Is that like all that or something like that? Yeah it's called Operation Charm. I've never heard of that. Yeah. Yeah it says like right on the. Right on the fucking home screen. Of their website like. If you have like a. A subscription to Mitchell One. Or any of that. Mitchell One yeah that's a good one. Yeah he's like if you have an active. Subscription to that. Let us know and we'll compensate you. If you like share your login information. With us. Wow are you kidding me? Yeah that's what it says on there. I mean I don't understand. Why would you share it with them? That doesn't make sense. Because they scrape the websites. Okay. I'll send. This fucking thing to you. I'm sure they get a lot of people that's willing to do it. I mean. I've tried to do it. Myself. I've tried to scrape those websites but it's. I don't know it's difficult. Scraping it can be difficult. Yeah I can imagine. Okay so. That'd be like creating an aggregator. And sharing. An algorithm. This is the website I just sent it to you. Yeah so this is the. This website I just sent you. That's the one that has like all the different. Like. Yeah all the dealership stuff. You can find on there for whatever car. It has almost every car. But there's this. And this is free. But. It's a little bit more difficult to navigate. Than. I don't know the one that I pay for. Is nice. Because I can like. I don't know it's a lot easier to find what I'm looking for. I mean I'm saying for instance. Are you able to look my car up with it or not? Yeah. Oh okay. Yeah like. Let's see. I imagine it's very helpful. It gives you like a step by step. Direction breakdown. Yeah. So this is a. Ford what? It's a 2017. Ford Escape. Gabby's. Girlfriend. Doesn't go up that high. It goes up to 2013. That sucks. Yeah. You can see. Oh yeah. Ford Escape. Four wheel drive? Front wheel drive. Okay. Is it 4.2 in it? Or is it 6.3? 1.5. Okay. 1.5 4 cylinder. Okay. Alright. 2.0. That's the closest thing. And it's a 2013 is what. The closest thing on here. For sure. But. Are you looking at it too? No I actually didn't. But I will. I was just letting you look at it first. Gasket. Okay. Well. But. It doesn't really have it. Which sucks. I mean. It's probably got like a similar. It's so close. 13. Four years off. There's got to be another. There's got to be something else. I mean surely there's. I mean. I don't get it. This is the free version. Okay then maybe that's why. Yeah. Yeah the paid version would be. Yeah. Certainly definitely way. Way more helpful. Yeah that's exactly why. Well we can print something off offline. Of how to do it. We can print videos. Like step by step videos on YouTube too. Yeah. I don't have a torque wrench. Yeah I got one. Okay. I think yeah. I think we have everything. Okay. I believe we. I believe we should. We should have knocked this out in one day. Honestly. I got all the. Specialty tools and everything. Yeah. To you know. To put it back in time. Yeah. He said 2017. Ford Escape. Yeah I wonder how much it costs to go buy a book. Damn. Man fuck that book. Yeah but then I get to keep it. I'm sorry. Yeah. Oh I got a PDF now. Oh that's cool. Wow there's a free version. On you. Y-U-M-P-U. That's actually pretty cool. I wonder if there's shit on here. Yeah. Maybe. Oh. Oh. Well you know what. They don't go on. Well it says from. Escape 01 to 17. Yeah. I don't know if this is helpful or not. It says I can download a PDF. Yeah it should. He said it was a. 4 cylinder. And it was a 1.8. 1.5. 1.5. Yes. So here's the crazy thing. Is this particular car. They only made this car. For 3 years. And made it 2017. Through 2019. And all of them. Have a defective block. You hear that. Yeah. Yeah. And it blows up the head gaskets. On cylinder 2. And cylinder 2 and 3. In between 2 and 3. Because the walls. Between the cylinders. From one cylinder to the next. Is so thin. There's not a lot of room there. Holy shit. Huh. It says that the labor hours. For replacing the head gasket. 14 to 15 hours. 14 to 15 hours. Yeah. Why do I find that hard to believe. But maybe. I don't know. You think it's going to take that long. Well yeah. I knew right away. It was going to take at least 8 or 9 hours. Yeah. I think it's going to take a little while. All day I'm sure. Yeah. It is what it is. Unless you don't want to do it. Isn't this the one that you. Got a new engine out for. No. That was a different one. Uh huh. And that engine right there. It's not going to be that easy to put in either. It's going to be a pain in the ass. So yeah. That was going to be a pain in the ass for sure. Because it was a total pain in the ass to get it out. Yeah. You had to use their cherry picker. I did but. It's just the amount of shit that I had to take off. It's not like I could just unhook the motor. And just hang on it as it was. I had to unhook everything. That means everything from this car. Is going to be put. Back on their new engine. Right. All kind of shit. Sensors. Brackets. Fucking alternators. Holy shit. A lot. This fucking pump. That's on the left side of the engine. Power steering pump. That's another one. Yeah. That's going to be a pain in the ass. Probably a two day job right there. Yeah. Yeah. But it should run good after it's in there. Yeah. As long as you don't fuck anything up. Like taking it out. Or putting it back in. Yeah. Which in some cases is easy to do. I know. Taking that I didn't care if I broke anything. Right. I didn't break anything on the motor or anything. But yeah. I cut some shit on my car. That's for sure. Yeah. Wiring harness. Whatever. I'm not going to do that on this car here. Because you don't have to use this yet. So that means you have to be really careful and take longer time. But I was also thinking that just dropping the whole engine and transmission together. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe if there's enough room to take it out of the hood. Maybe not. Might be easier to do that. Just pull it straight up and out. If you don't want to take the bottom apart. You know what I mean. Just take the motor out the top and put it back in there. That's the way to go. Because that's a lot of shit you don't have to take apart. You know. Just focus on the bolts around the fucking engine. Focus on the torque converter bolts. Starter. All the wiring harness all around it. All that shit. Exhaust pieces. Yeah I'm looking at the instructions right now. I'm talking about the cross for the engine. That's the view for the cross motor we're talking about. Now the Ford Escape. That's just the top end. But you know like you're saying. It's going to take some time. To take the side of the motor apart and shit. Okay. I got to get going. Gabby's trying to come in here and go to bed. Alright. What time are you trying to get dropped off? I think somewhere between. Somewhere between 7 and 9. Alright. Well in that very time frame. I take my son to daycare. Okay. So. Just call me when you're on the way. So I can see where you're at and where I'm at. I have to drop him off at the plane. But if you get here early enough. You can just ride with me to drop him off at the plane. Alright. I'm pretty sure that we drop off our kids. I know that. I know that we drop off our kids. In between like 8 and 8.30? Yeah. I try to get him there about 8. Same time. 8 o'clock. Yeah. That way they start breakfast at 8.30. I try to get him there right before breakfast. That way he can be having breakfast there. When he goes. Alright man. I'll let you go. I'll see you tomorrow. Alright. Bye bye. Bye.",

Ava wants me to grab more of those like boxes of Indian food that I got, but I don't know what you want. I don't know. I'm not really in the mood for cooking. I could even eat one of those Indian things. They're pretty good. Yeah. Yeah. What are you, like, leaving work now? I'm about to, like, start wrapping up and stuff, because, I mean, if I'm going to go grab stuff, I need to close up shop and then go in there really quickly and be out of here before, like, 3.50, so that I'm not late to pick up Atlas. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what. Nothing sounds good right this second, because I just ate not too long ago, but probably just some of those chicken patty things and hamburger buns. Okay. So more chicken patties and hamburger buns. Do you like the spicy one, or do you want me to just get the regular one? Yeah, I like the spicy ones. Okay. Okay. Well, I'll grab some hamburger buns and some spicy chicken patties and some of that bread that she wanted last night, and then more of those boxes of Indian food, I guess. Okay. Okay. What time is it? It is 3.22. So, like, at, like, 3.30, I'll probably start slowly wrapping up or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. I just kind of sat here all day. Yeah? Yeah. I feel you. Okey dokey. What's Alex doing? Just inside? Yeah, he's been hanging out with Ava most of the day, but I did take him with me to the hardware store and smoke shop, but smoke shop has got, like, really fucking whack selection of stuff right now, so I didn't even get anything there. No, for sure. The one that was in town, obviously. Yeah, the one that's right on the block, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okey dokey. Yeah, I was hoping that I would have gotten... Actually, I might need you to send me, like, 20 bucks so I can get gas, because I thought I got paid by it, and I have, like, 60 miles, and I thought I'd be, like, have money by now so that I could have gotten gas after work, but let me check. Yeah, it still says I only have 35 cents. Alright, say that whole thing again. So, basically, I, last night, I drove, or whatever, this morning, I drove with, like, 120 miles, I got to work, I have, like, 60 miles left, so I'm not gonna make it home, really, unless I go and get gas after this, and I thought, since today's payday, usually I get paid by noon, and I haven't gotten paid, so I need you to send me, like, 20 bucks or something. So that I can get gas when I leave here. Okay. Please. Yeah, I really do need to wrap up at, like, 3.30 so I can go inside and grab some things and stop and get gas. Where are you coming from? Huh? Where are you working? Monticello. Yeah, so it's, like, an hour and 10 minutes, but I got here early, so I should have the whole, if I clock out at 3.50, then I worked six hours, exactly. Also, tomorrow, my mom wants to hang out the boys and you're supposed to come with me to Painesville tomorrow, right? Yeah. Okay. So, yeah, I guess we just, I don't know if we have to even get them ready. She said she'll be back at home at 8, like, tomorrow morning, I think. So she was, like, asking me all these fucking questions this morning when I was, like, waking up, and I was like, why? Like, why are you asking me all these questions? She's like, oh, I wanted to see if the boys could stay home tomorrow. She's like, I'll be there at 8, and I was like, okay, for what? And she was like, I don't know, just to hang out. And I was like, okay. So I guess she's watching them tomorrow. Okay. What? That's pretty convenient. It works out pretty well. Yeah, so I guess we don't really have to rush home, but, I mean, you're going to be with me. You're probably going to want to leave, like, once I get off work. Obviously, I'm not going to try to stay later, but, yeah, we don't have to rush home. To make it on time. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe I'll. I can't really do that. I don't know. Yeah, all right. I was going to say, like, I can't. It might be a good idea for me to, like, go out to Benson and grab some stuff or something like that. But, like, it's not like you've got, like, really the best cargo vehicle. Right. I don't know what stuff. What stuff are you trying to grab? Oh, I have, like, a wheelbarrow and a fucking dolly. I don't know. There's some stuff. Yeah. No, I don't think we're going to fit either of those things in my car. That's what I just fucking said. I know. I just wanted to know what you were thinking. And I was like, oh, maybe we could, like, strap it on or something. Like, no, that's dumb. Don't bring your fucking wheelbarrow. Yeah. All right. Okay, well, I'll talk to you. Send me 20 bucks, please. No, I don't want to. You have to. I need to get home. No, I think it's about time for me to laugh at your expense. Oh, really? Yeah. I don't know why you're saying that. Like, that's not even my money. That's my money. It's just in your account. Huh? The money. When I send you money and then you got all these returns. Then I also got a paycheck. Yeah. Well, I never got the first half of the money that you had that you had. Just send me 20 bucks. Who are you talking to right now? Just fucking shut up. You shut up. I'm on speakerphone. You shut up and send me 20 bucks, please. I am. God. Okay. Okay, bye. Hold on. What? I wouldn't fucking just get off the phone with me. All right. Quick. Okay. Sorry. Anyone. Okay. It's okay. Okay. All right. I'll see you. All right. Bye. Bye.",

So fixing my vehicle right away is what works Yeah, I suppose that also but like I just said like we're muscling all this money into your car and like you still have to like fix your window And you still have to do this and your car is like basically gonna fall apart.

What are you talking about? I have been trying to get ahold of you, and I called you and texted you earlier today. No response. No reply. No call. Sorry, my phone's been on silent almost all day. I don't even think I really looked at it more than like five minutes. That's a really bad excuse. But anyways, going off topic from this wonderful woman. Ah, Milo, let go of my sweatshirt. My name's been good. We just got back from McDonald's. What about you? No, it's Taco Bell. Taco Bell. What? McDonald's. We just came back from Taco Bell. Okay. Nice. Good. Yeah. What about you? We had spaghetti for dinner. Where are you right now? In little baby's room. Just put it on a movie for him. We just got out of the shower a little bit ago. Yeah, everybody's got clothes on so far. So you won't have to videotape us like you normally do, you fucking weirdo. Oh yeah, I sent that video to somebody. I can't remember who, but I sent it to somebody. Yeah. I sent it to one of the people who have a crush on me. Well, hopefully the police. Oh, no, I sent it to one of my friends who have a crush on me. I gotcha. Yeah, so what's the plan for tomorrow? What? So what's the plan for tomorrow? I don't know. That's why I was trying to talk to you earlier today. Get your fucking foot out of my face. Cheers, man. I need you to bring the kids medication or have it transferred because that needs to happen. You haven't done it yet. No, I can't remember. I know I started doing it, but then I got distracted with something else. Okay, well, they need to get back on their medication, specifically Ashton. Yeah. Yeah. She's acting crazy. No, but it's just you can't just take antidepressants all willy nilly and like be gone in one day and off in the next. It's just like it's not good for her. And she's been feeling irritable and tired all the time, which are signs of depression. But also, I don't know. Maybe if you guys wanted to come down here tomorrow, we could hang out at the house. I'm like super broke right now. Me too. Did you ever get that money from her beer or that other place? No. No, I haven't yet. Did her beer ever follow up with you again saying like if they got it approved or anything? No, I haven't. I haven't talked to her or heard from her since we talked to her that one day, which how long ago was that? That was like a month ago now, right? Yeah, at least. Because that was before I moved here. Yeah. Yeah. Here a month ago. I just paid rent. Yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. But I'm tired. I just got my pick them up right after. Well, Ashton has a friend spending the night that she met at school and then her friend's grandma works at Taco Bell. So, she told us to come up and get the kids food and she just gave me like half off like her discount or whatever. So, I picked them up right before I even came inside from work. So, I'm like just getting home and changing. I want to relax and watch some movie or something. Yeah. So, I don't know. Do you want to talk to Gabby and see what she thinks? And then if you guys come down here, I can probably get like some stuff to make something for dinner or something. I don't know. Right on. Okay. All right. Did you get the truck fixed yet? No, I got to get a new tranny. I had a chance to get a different tranny, but like there was no guarantee that it was going to like be a working transmission. So, I declined to get it. And now I just need to wait a couple more days till I can afford to get a working one. Okay. Yeah. All right. Yeah, I guess just talk to Gabby and see what you guys think and then we'll go from there. I'm not done talking to you. All right. Well, Ella's not done talking to you, but I am. Okay. All right. Goodbye. Bye. Allie! So. You can follow me. Pleasure. Pleasure. Hello. Dada. Yeah, what's up? I'm here to talk about school trauma. Even though you might not like it, or you will like it, it's being told to you. Okay. Okay. It is wild. So, basically, this guy told me he liked me on the third day of first day of school for me. There, at least. And I was like, okay, we can talk, but I want to date immediately. And then we were talking, and the second day we were talking, I found out that he just got off the talking stage. And he was like, you know, I don't like you. Yeah. Please. And he was like, not to me, but to this other girl he was talking to, he was like, I don't like you. I don't like your best friend. And I was like, what? That's what he said to you? No, to a different girl. Okay. And that same girl, I became friends with, and she told me that happened. I'm like, oh. And that was just like three days prior to me coming there. So I was like, oh, my God. So yeah, I told him I didn't want to talk to him anymore. And then he got pissed, and I guess that led to him spreading some crazy-ass rumors around about me. It was like so wild, too. Like the rumors were like illegal things, too. Yeah. Yeah, like the main one, like he made multiple, but like the main one that kind of like pissed me off the most. Like, sorry for my language, or, you know, you don't like me saying that, but like, whatever, whatever. It was saying like how I essayed a man, like, what? And he said, like, that's why, like, he kept on telling like almost every person in the school, like, hey, did you know that Ariella sexually assaulted a guy, and that's why she can't boys over? And like, he told one of my friends, and then like, she was like, how do you know? And then he said, she told me over text. And, um, yeah, and I'm like, what? I had never said anything relating to any of that, you know, text. And then he was like, you know, I stopped talking to her. I have screenshots of me saying I don't want to talk to him anymore. Like, bro. Yeah, that's crazy. It's like really weird. Like, yo, why is he so upset over something so petty? Like, take rejection, bro. Yeah. Hmm. What? Yeah, well, I mean, you're one thing that you're going to have to get used to, boys your age, not having the same maturity level as you. I guess. What's your thought? Um, I don't know. Basically what I just said. I mean, I wouldn't expect, I wouldn't expect other people, other boys to be as rational as you are. And, you know, to behave correctly, because guys just don't know how to act right until they're like 40 years old. Like you. Yeah, sure, dude, I'm not even 40 years old and I can't get it right. See what I'm saying? Huh? You see what I'm saying? I guess. Yeah. Yeah, I'm going to talk to the counselor or principal on Monday about that, Brandon. Yeah. Because that's like, it's not just like being mean or like kind of starting a stupid rumor. That's like a criminal offense that he's trying to spread. That's like serious. And plus you've got boys bullying me. Like, it'd be different if it's like girls playing me, but having a whole different gender bullying me and trying to like hit me is different. Like, what? Yeah. Yeah. Like I'm new and like, let me live. Yeah. And you're not like egging us on yourself. No, I don't want drama. And I seen the message, the messages between them. She wasn't like mean or rude or anything. She was just like, I just don't want to. I think we should just be friends, basically. Like, I don't know you. I just moved here. We should just stay friends. And he is a little bitch. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm generous. A nice trust. Milo. Can you hold toes with me? No. Like your face becomes so disgusting. Ow! You little shit. Get out of my room, Milo. Come on. He like sits under the blanket right next to the bed and just waits to pounce on me. Come on. No. Get off my sheet, you little shite. Come on. Out of here. Come on. You know, I feel like it's like, like, like almost everybody in my school, like, knew about it. Like, some of them didn't tell me until, like, my friend at lunch told me. And I was like, wait, what? That's crazy. And then, yeah, she told me. And. Is that a boy? Is that one of the boys? Yeah. Which one of the boys? Alex. Huh? Alex. The cutie. All right. I'm going to go out there. You hate me, mom. Come out here. Fine. But I don't know. That's what's up. Are you done with your slushie? Yeah. You know, like. Also, like, makes it different because, like, why are there, why are you having your guy friends, like, harassing me and, like, hitting me? Like, yo. We're in eighth grade and you're doing that? No. No. He's like, I never even touched any. I haven't even touched with a guy who'd be trying to hit me once. And I don't say anything mean to him. Like, like, like, at first he was just doing the usual. Like, oh, you like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Even though I don't like them. Like, you just try and put me on with somebody. Like, like, of course I'm like, no. I don't even know who that is. And until, like, the rumor started. Oh, that's not yours. That's not mine. I was wearing. I thought you were talking about, like. Yeah. You know, and then randomly he started, like, trying to hit me and, like, just on a, what is it called? On Wednesday, he, like, formed, just, like, hit my back. Like, blatantly. Like, now I'm trying to be conspicuous about it. But not conspicuous. He wasn't even trying to, like, hide the fact that he was trying to hit me. He just formed, just, like, hit me. I'm like, no. And I didn't even do anything after that. And, like, some, like, calm and patient trust. Because I wasn't even trying to, like, make the situation worse than it was already. So I didn't do nothing. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Yeah. Like, the girls are all chill with me. Like, they're on my side. It's just the guys. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, we talk more tomorrow. It's super late. I want to lay down and get some rest. Are you in your bed? No. Yeah. Well, I'm going to be in, like, 30 seconds. Where are you right now? On your chair? Yeah. What was that? I don't know. Seriously? I think he's going to be all day. All right. See you tomorrow, okay? Huh? All right, sweetheart. I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay? Okay. All right. I love you. Love you, Dad. Okay. I love you. Love you. Good night. Good night.",

    "transcript": "So I just finished my test and I was going to stop at the Wal-Mart because Angelo gave me some stuff to return. I don't know if they're going to let me return it because he got it at the Princeton Wal-Mart, but I figured while I was there I should also get some dinner or something. Do you know what you want for dinner? No. Okey-dokey. Dude, yeah, I went over to, like when I got back from dropping the boys off and stuff, Angelo called, or after I also finished court, but he called me to ask me if I could give him a ride to school. And I was like, yeah, I guess, like I have time to do that. And so I go over there to give him a ride and like this fucking huge-ass argument like fucking blows up between like Elijah, Angelo, and Dan. And that was so fucking awkward. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And like they were basically like yelling at him, basically like almost kicked like, I don't know, like I already said, like, I'd move out, like grandma won't let me, blah, blah, blah. And he's like, fine. You want to fucking leave, then leave. And like, I don't know, Dan's kind of like, they're all low-key a little crazy. I was like, damn. And he was like, I'm sorry. You had to be here for that. And I was like, oh, it's okay. And then Vicki messaged me and she was just like, just so you know, like he's manipulating you and da-da-da-da-da. And then I was like, girl, what? And I was like, I just went to give him a ride. Like I didn't mind doing that. I understand he should be a little bit more responsible and wake up and go to school on time and take the bus. But like, it wasn't like he fucking like sent me some sob story that he like fucking didn't know when it was going to give him a ride. So that happened today. Oh, yeah. Yeah. So I hope they don't fucking, I don't know, because I didn't I like responded to her like I was like, yeah, no, I understand. Like, it wasn't a problem. I didn't mind giving him a ride. Like, I agree, you know, you should be a little bit more responsible. And like, I figured, you know, he's just a kid, like having someone with like an outside perspective like to like, you know, talk to him about like, you know, respecting you guys a little bit more would be helpful, like blah, blah, blah. I'm just frustrated. And I was like, I didn't even respond because I was like, I'm I don't know, I'm not trying to have this conversation. Like, I'm not trying to be involved. And so yeah, Angelo said he was gonna go over to Deja's or something after school. So I don't know. Hopefully nothing else happens. Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. Gosh, you're beautiful. Yeah. I'm sorry. Yeah. Gosh, you're being manipulated. I know you are. I know. I am. I'm always, everyone's always manipulating me. Apparently, I'm very manipulative for manipulation. I don't know. I fall for manipulation easily. Apparently. Yeah. Gosh. Gosh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Gosh. I was like, I didn't know, asking your aunt for a ride and like, I don't know, I think they're just like up to wit's end with Angelo and so like anything he does, like just pisses them off, which like, I understand, but like, I also get that like, that's not like I'm condoning his behavior, but like, at the same time, like, I just know Angelo is like that kid. Like, you know what I mean? Like, you just don't want to like, argue with that kid. Like, he's just kind of dumb. Like, he's not like, Dan was like, Oh, yeah, that's a really good last word. And he's like, okay. And like, they were just like, arguing and I was like, honestly, everyone in this situation looks a little dumb. Because like, why are you a child arguing with your grandpa? Why is your grandpa, like an adult arguing with you? Like, I literally just like be like, you fucking think you're big and tough, like fucking pack your shit, leave, like end the story. But they were like, just arguing, like, almost like badass, almost like he was like, fucking taunting him too. Like, he's like getting all up in his face, like not Angelo, like Dan was getting in Angelo's face. And then like, Angelo was like, backing up a little bit. And he's like, Oh, are you scared? You know, he's like, No, I'm not fucking scared. I was like, Jesus Christ, what's going on here? Yeah. Yeah. Geez. It was like, full on, like, fucking domestic over there. I was like, and like, it all started with like, Angelo said some like, dumb ass remarks to fucking Elijah and Elijah got so pissed off and he like, literally was like, shut your fucking mouth and like, fucking slam the door like two or three times and I was like, dude, is it that serious? Like, what the fuck was that? And then he like, fucking comes back, like, because Katie came in and Katie was like, what's going on? And Elijah's like, that guy won't stop running his fucking mouth and blah, blah, blah. And then like, they all just started kind of like bickering. And then like, he like went outside and then Dan came inside with it. And like, you have a fucking respect problem, like you fucking don't respect anyone, da da da da da. And then Angelo just started going off too and I was like, what the fuck and I was just sitting there on the couch like, um, can I go home now? Can I call my mom? Mom? Can you pick me up? They're yelling. Yeah. Geez. So yeah. Also, Angelo's starting a business and I told him to reach out to you so you can help him with like his LLC and fucking, um, what else, um, trademarking stuff or whatever. And he was like, you know how to do that? And I was like, yeah, I know how to do it. And I was like, but Brandon taught me how to do it. And I was like, you can ask Brandon to help you. I'm sure he'd love to help you. And, um, he's like, oh, okay. And then he's like, I also, he's like, I need to get a shirt. And I started looking online for one and I was like, yeah, you could get some on Facebook marketplace. And he's like, yeah. And I need a cricket. And I was like, Brandon has a cricket. And he's like, shut up. Does he really? And I was like, yeah. And I was like, call Brandon. And it talks to him. Brandon would love, he would kick his feet to help you. I don't have feet. Yeah, you'd be kicking your little feet and giggling if Angela asked you to help. Shut up. He'd be like, I know how to do LLC stuff. I know how to trademark stuff. I got a cricket you can use. But yeah, you do some like decal fucking weird shit. So. I'm going to go into this Walmart and see if I can repeat, like got the wrong vinyls or something. And so he gave me the receipt and the two vinyls to see if I can return them. And then, um, and then, yeah, and then I'm going to grab, I don't know, whatever. You don't have any idea of what you want? Oh, I don't even know what you're talking about. Dinner. I'll just, don't we have more meat? Should we just eat more meat? And I'll just get like some mashed potatoes or something. Yeah, maybe. I'll grab some mashed potatoes and maybe like some asparagus. You like asparagus? No, I don't. I like green beans. No, you don't. You want green beans? Yeah. All right. I'll get some mashed potatoes and green beans then. Fine. All right. Goodbye.",

No, I mean, if you, I dunno, like I could stop and get something or we can just do different dinner kind of things, cause I did get those, like, if you look in the freezer, I got this a gyro, like a gyro, like a kit to make gyros. I don't know if you like that though. So you could just make a hamburger and I can make that for dinner. I'm not really in the mood for a burger per se, but I could also stop and get something else if you want, if you don't want to make burgers for yourself, super duper, I don't know.

Oh, okay. You're like not on the record, but. So what do you want to do? Am I stopping? Am I not stopping? You want to try the gyro thing? I don't know, dude. I don't like the way you say gyro, so.

Uh-huh. And I was like, no, dude, we're not, like, continuing to walk, like, that's crazy. Yeah, he just felt the fresh air, and the nice weather, and he was like, go, keep going. Yeah, like, we've already walked, like, easily, like, 12, 12 blocks. Yeah. Two. Yeah, we've probably walked. But that was good. Uh-huh. Why did you take that risk with you? I don't know.

So I need to transfer two prescriptions for two different people over to your facility. Are they at another Walgreens right now? No, the prescriptions are being held at Wellia Pharmacy in Mora, Minnesota. Okay, and they're open today? Yeah, they're open until noon today. Okay, and then have the two people gotten anything out of Walgreens before? Yes, they have before. Okay, what's the date of birth of the first person? 9-12-11. I do apologize, you cut out there. Oh, 9-12-2011. And what's her last name? Gillis, G-I-L-L-E-S. For Ariella? Yep. What is the most recent address? Because she has quite a few profiles. Most recent address is 130 Forest Avenue, Mora, Minnesota. But, you know, they're probably going to need to update that address when they come in and see you. Yeah, yeah. I'm just trying to find her profile in the Walgreens system real quick here. That one didn't pop up. What about between these four cities, what was the most recent one? Elk River, Ramsey, Anoka, or Minneapolis? Ramsey. Okay. You want me to tell you that address? Not at this second. I'm just trying to find her profile. Once the prescriptions pull over, they should have the address on there as well. I'm just grabbing all the info I need to give to the pharmacist so she can call over and transfer them. Okay. What's the date of birth of the next person? 6-6-13. For Ashton? Yep. Okay. Give me one second. I just have to grab something off the printer with their info on it. Then I'll grab the remaining info I need from you, like the pharmacy name, phone number, that sort of stuff. So I'll be back in just a moment. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. The next bit of info, are we taking everything they have over there, or are we just pulling over a certain thing? Everything? Yeah, everything. Okay. If things don't have a refill available, they won't be transferred over. Just to give you a heads up. Okay. Only prescriptions with refills can be transferred. Okay. So anything that doesn't have one will just need to be sent in to us directly from the doctor. Okay. All right. Is it possible you can give me a heads up on what does have a refill? We probably won't know that until you talk to them. Yeah, we won't know that until we talk to them and they send us over everything that does have refills. Okay. What's the pharmacy name? Well, it's called Willia, like W-E-L-I-A. And pharmacy in Mora, Minnesota, M-O-R-A. And do you have their phone number? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. One second. Okay. Is it? Oh, yeah, it's Willia Health. And then the phone number is 320-225-3999. Okay. And then do they need anything filled right now? Or are we just pulling it over and putting it on their profile until they need something filled? They do need stuff filled. Yes. Do you know what they need filled? One of them is like, so for Ariella, she has like some sort of acid reflux medicine that needs to be filled. And then... Like omeprazole or famotidine? Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. And then for Ashton, she has like some form of Zoloft that needs to be refilled. Perfect. All right. We'll call over there as soon as we can. And as soon as they send those to us, we'll get them pulled over here and get those two prescriptions filled for each of them. And then do you want notifications when their stuff is ready? Sure, sure. But I could also give you a different phone number. Yeah, for like the on-site parent that's going to be picking those up would probably be good. Yeah, whoever you want the notification to go to, I'll take their phone number. Okay. All right. One second. Okay. Okay. It's 763-620-4412. All right. So they'll get the notifications when we get these in. I want to say probably either later this afternoon, if not like tomorrow. It all depends on how long it takes that pharmacy to send them to us. Okay. Copy. But we will go ahead and get that process started. All right. Perfect. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Have a good one. You too. Bye. Bye-bye.",

Um, also, when I try, I keep trying to do this shit with getting their meds, but they said that they're, um, that you probably should have, would have gotten, like, new cards, because I guess the insurance cards that you sent me are, like, old ones, and so they're not able to process it, and they tried looking it up, but they can't find it on their system, so I was saying, do you have, like, other cards or something?

Yes sign that sign the document for sure for sure Yeah Okay Yeah, yeah, I can do that. I'll do that. I'll do that right right away right now Okay, but yeah things have gone What's kind of Yeah, yeah, yeah the other the car thing I'm still I'm still trying to figure it out. I I mean I have like two solutions and I'm just kind of waiting for my finances to I'm like waiting for a little bit of money to come in. That's gonna kind of aid in that because basically I can either like fix my truck, which is what I've been working towards or I can you know, just purchase a new secondary vehicle for you know the time period and I'm kind of Still exploring both options and just kind of waiting for my for some money to come through Yeah, not because like I Got my truck like like I put a new transmission in there and then I found out that that transmission Wasn't a good transmission. So I have to take that one out and now I'm just gonna purchase like a brand new transmission And yeah, that just cost money It does cost money Yeah Which is okay, it's just Car problems, especially before it gets to winter. You gotta get on top of him. Yeah, definitely yeah, and it is a little concerning the coming back on December 11th, like it's just kind of like a time crunch. So I'm kind of Yeah a little but I mean as far as my mental health goes like it's I'm definitely in a an extreme better state than I was. I don't I don't even know what the hell I was like really Concerned for a minute there. I was like man what's going on with me? Like maybe I need to like talk to my doctor maybe maybe I have like bipolar disorder or something like that and I just don't know and Yeah Conditions, I mean well I have like ADHD I have PTSD and I've you know I've experienced depression like before in the past but like, you know on a day-to-day basis Like I don't really suffer from depression but when this whole car thing happened and you know, that was a drag obviously, but then like One and one one other thing that was kind of big was like so I eventually brought my car back my truck back here and I think like, you know it's a little bit of an eyesore and I live right next door to where one of the places where I go to meetings at and So like a lot of my sober community they seen like the condition that my truck was in and I mean if you see it it it's an eyesore and it Does it just looks? sketchy and like I think that the people in my community my sober community seen that and they're like Yeah, Brandon's up to fucking no good so I don't I don't know if the word is really Excommunicated me but like I don't know my sober community out here is like I Don't know. So that got me down for a little while and I'm you know talking with my old sponsor again since I've had the time off and You know kind of Reset things that way because my sobriety has still been good, you know this entire time and Yeah, but it was a little bit of a downer kind of like because some some people had said some things to me that they weren't sure if I was sober or not and I was like, I don't know just really kind of Somewhat like offended but at the same time, I don't really need to defend something. That's not like real so I Don't know Yeah, I I mean, have you been going up to Anna or no? Anna and then I'm not sure what that word means. What are you saying? The ladies the LADC the one that works with The moral facility. Oh, have you connected? No, no, I never got I never got a like a green light from you to talk with them about that so I have not engaged in that but I don't if there's some sort of Solution that can be made with that or some sort of green light I can get I can get from you Then I would pursue that Can I go ahead yes Just Not on a partnership level if there's a partnership Then that's where you include a dear mom and my hugs for any MOUs or partnerships But in general, I think you should connect with her Okay Yeah Because she's a LADC. She she guide you in better ways than I can because I'm all the way in the cities at times And she has a lot of experience and that's why I say this Yeah, yeah, she's cool I have met with her before But you're saying that if it's a Meeting connecting with her on like a work level then I need to include you said somebody's name My heart my any MOU I'm Mod for MOU time Yeah, okay All right, I'm gonna make a note of that real quick Okay Okay, I got you All right.

Case that address has another adult. Can you tell me your living situation right now? Oh, so your name is Brianna. You're my caseworker for Canada County. Yep. Yeah, there's no other no other adults on there except for me. Right now. What's your address? They didn't have an address for you. Yeah. Well, I don't have a permanent address. Right now, we've been staying. I told my last worker this too. And but my mailing addresses out in Canada County at the 130 Forest Avenue. Yep. Yeah. Yeah, right now. I think the address is 1447 Gable Lane and Maplewood. That's where we've been staying. And we've kind of been because I'm not on a lease anywhere. And I'm trying to get on a lease in like the Blaine area. And yeah, but just systematically, we've kind of been hopping around different places. But we haven't really been able to stay. But are you? Is it Maplewood? You said because it's the I just have to get the case to be in the county that you're like staying at, like, yeah, right now, it's showing like this other case that you're that there's maybe an absent parent, I'm not sure. Gabriella, that is that the address that you're at? So it's like coming up with conflicting information. So I'm just trying to figure out. I have the mailing address, but they shouldn't have transferred your case if you didn't have like, actually have a residence here, you know? Yeah, yeah, I told him that too. I mean, I told him that this wasn't my residence. So do you want or what what county would it be that you were in? I can put you as homeless and put the mailing address still as that one, but it's your case should be where you guys are like staying mostly. Yeah, I mean, I mean, I guess right now the other that would be the best description because I'm not on a lease out in Mora. And we, we stay out there. You know, I don't know, kind of infrequently, but like, we're, yeah, we're not really allowed to stay there because of the size of my family. Okay. Yeah. So like, that's the only thing, though, is that, so if there's, if that's the mother of the children's house that you're at, then like, that's a, that would be like a family that you have to have her added to the unit. You know what I mean? Right. That's why she's not. Okay. So what county is, did you say Maplewood or Maple Grove? Maplewood. So that's Dakota. I don't, I don't know if it's, I'm really not sure. I think it might actually still even be Hennepin still. Okay. Okay. So I'll try. I just want to figure it out where I should keep, or if I should keep the case here or whatever. So I was trying to just get a hold of you because otherwise, then I don't want to have to do like fraud or fraud for the I don't want to have to do like fraud or fraud for the healthcare and like. Yeah. By all means. Like I would, I would, I would really, I would really not. Cause I've worked with other people that like, you know, this sort of thing happens with them. And like, I know that like, as far as me receiving benefits, it can become rather messy, like about, like, you know, I just recertified. So I know I should be good for like a year, but yeah, I mean, this would be the best address. Like I'm hearing more today, but it's cause I had to pick up my kids from daycare. But yeah, I mean, it'd be great if you could keep it in this area. I mean, unless there's going to be like a conflict with, you know, Gabby being at this address. Right. I mean, if, and if it needs to be, if I need to like tell you a different address, I mean, that's not going to change my mailing address. Right. Right. No, I get that. Okay. I, yeah, I will just run it by my supervisor so he can just decide on that. And then if it's, if that's not a problem, other, like if it's not a problem of a household comps and with, you know, her not being her house, then I'll just leave it. But I can always call and let you know, or send you a notice too, cause you'll get the mail there anyway. So, okay. You know, I was gonna, I was gonna actually maybe you can actually answer this question for me. Cause I was going to be applying for some sort of emergency assistance because my, my truck broke down and I didn't have an inch and it was vandalized. And I found out that because yeah, basically the Hennepin County, isn't going to be able to cover like the loss because of the incident. And so I guess my next plan was to either speak with lakes and pines or let's see, or apply for emergency assistance for like an emergency car repair thing. Yeah. So for our emergency assistance program, it's for like, it would be for a utility shutoff it would be for a utility shutoff and eviction of foreclosure or like a gas shutoff is what we like to look at for emergency, for our emergency program for families. I don't know what happens if they have like a broader program. Lakes and pines may be able to help you. I'm not sure what their funding is like right now. It's the end of the year. So like we'll get new funding again. Or most people usually think if they got there, they get it on the first two. But yeah. And that would be something you'd want to apply for definitely in a case that you're like staying at, but I don't think that like a car repair would be considered that he would do that. I can ask him to he's done for the day out today. I'm just finishing up my work. So I can call you back tomorrow with an answer on if that's something that you'd consider, but I don't believe like that because they've kind of widened it up a little bit more because it's the end of the year and they want to use the funding, but I don't think that they do car repairs because like right now you don't have a place to stay. It'd have to resolve your emergency completely. And right now you don't have like a place to stay with your kids and stuff like that. So that's what my temporary answer is, but I can definitely ask him tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'll just wait to hear back from you till tomorrow then. Okay. All right. All right. I will speak with him and I'll give you a call. Thank you. All right. You too. Bye.",

How are you doing? I'm doing good. How are you? I'm okay. See, the reason I was calling today, I have three daughters that are all U-Care. They all have their minors under my plan, but they all have U-Care. I thought that I had the most recent updated card, and I just switched pharmacies for them, and I'm being told that their cards are expired. But I haven't received any new cards from you guys, so I don't know if I need to update my address and have you guys send out new ones or something, but I was hoping to follow up with that today. Okay. Are your children under the plan with... Under your plan? Quite possibly. I mean, I'm pretty sure they are, because I was the one that initially set it up, but it has been quite a few years. No, I mean, are you on the plan with them? Most likely. Okay. All right. Let me get some information from you, and then we'll take a look. What's a good phone number for you? 320-775-9130. Okay. Thank you. And do you have your U-Care member ID number? Yeah. I can give you that. It just takes me like two seconds to grab. Okay. Let me know whenever you're ready. Okay. All right. Thank you. All right. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. What's a good phone number for you? 320-775-9130. Okay. Let me give you that. It just takes me like two seconds to grab. All right. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. All right. Well, this is very odd. I usually keep it in my wallet. But I am not seeing it in my wallet right now. Okay. That's all right. So what is your first and last name? First name is Brandon, B-R-A-N-D-O-N. Last name is G-I-L-L-E-S. Okay. Thank you. And what's your birth date? 12-15-86. Okay. 86. All right. Thank you. Give me just a second. Just a moment while I pull up your plan here. All right. What is a good address for you? 130 Forest. That's F-O-R-E-S-T Avenue West. And that's in Mora, M-O-R-A, Minnesota, 55051. Okay. Would there be a different address on file? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. What is that address? 200 Sanford Road, Benson, Minnesota, 56215. And if not that one, I do got another one that would likely be the... Was that one on? Give me just a moment here. Yes. Alex, get down. Okay. So I show that you have the ConnectMedicaidOnly plan, and with you having that type of plan, what I will need for you to do is I will need for you to speak to a representative that handles that type of plan, and then they will be able to further assist you. Okay? Okay. Well, could we look up my daughter's to see if they're on the same? I mean, it's possible that they are not. Okay. Hold on just a second here. Okay. Bear with me one moment. And are they all on the plan together? They would be. Okay. What is the... I need one child's information, first, last name, and date of birth, please. Okay. I'll start out with the youngest, I suppose, or the oldest. I'll start out with the oldest. Her name is Ava, A-V-A. Last name's G-I-L-L-E-S. And then her date of birth is 03-10-10. Okay. Give me just a moment here. And then what is an address for Ava? Most recent address that might be on file would be 14165 Tungsten Street, Northwest, Ramsey. Okay. And what is the state and zip? Minnesota 55304, I think. 303 or something like that. Okay. 55303. Okay. Let's see. And you said that you are her father? Yeah. I'm dad. Yeah. Biological and custodial parent. Okay. Give me just a moment here. Okay. So you said that you are needing an ID card for Ava as well? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm thinking, well, so, I mean, I, yeah, we transferred. Yeah. I'll just give all new ones for, because I think the ones, all three of them, all three of the cards that I have, I obtained at the same time. And I'm being told that two of them are invalid. So I'm going to assume that all three of them are, must be invalid. Okay. And they all have the same type of plan. Correct. Okay. All right. So are you needing a replacement ID card as well? Well, I mean, if I'm, if I'm not on their plan, then I would probably have to go someplace else to get that. Wouldn't I? No. So what I would do with the plan that you have, I would get a representative and also Ava's. I would get a representative on the line and then they'll be able to assist you with your card and the three children's card as well. So if everyone is, if all the children are on the same plan, that representative that I get you in touch with, they will be able to request a replacement ID card for all of them. Okay. But now that you're seeing Ava's information, does it show you Care Connect as well? I show the plan is the prepaid medical assistance program. No cost share is what we have on file. Which is different than mine. Correct. And then what were you proposing that you transfer me to have somebody else like order me all new cards or would it be just possible for you to order new ones for the three girls? Because I'm not having any issues with my card. Okay. So then I will get a representative on the line. I cannot do it because I don't specialize in that department, but I will get a representative on the line and then they will be able to get the information that they need for the other two children. And also Ava and get an ID card issued. Okay. I understand. Okay. All right. Hold on just a moment. All right. Thank you. Get a representative on the line and then they will be right with you. Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you so much for calling you care. Hold on just a moment. Hold on just a moment. Hold on just a moment. I'm going to stop the playback. I'm going to start the recording. I'm going to start the recording. I'm going to start the recording. Hold on just a moment. I'm going to stop the recording. I'm going to start the recording. I'm going to start the recording. Now come back. Now come back. I'm going to stop the recording. I'm going to start the recording. I'm going to start the recording. Now come back. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. Hello. Hello, this is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Hey, I'm doing well yourself. I'm doing okay. Okay. And you were trying to get an ID card for your child. Is that correct? Yes. Yes. Yes. All three of them. Okay. Now for Ava, I am showing that coverage ended on October 31st. So this year. So you would have to contact the county. To see if they're still eligible. And I can give you their number and transfer you once we're done. What county is the case then? Well, I think when I originally. Filed with them, I may have been in Hennepin county. And then they moved to Anoka or Ramsey. So, which would be Anoka county. But right now my case is in Canada county. Okay. So whichever this is not active, whichever county. You guys are currently in. The county you can contact. Copy that. All right. Well, I was actually just missed a call from my case worker. I was on the phone with you guys, so I could give them a call back. Okay. No problem. And. Okay. So, did you have other children that you wanted to order cards for? Did you want me to look them up and see if they're. Active. No, because I already know that they're not apparently. Cause yeah. I tried to transfer. Pharmacies recently, and then the cards that I gave. That pharmacy, they were told. I was told that they weren't expired. So that's why I was calling to get new cards. But. No, right. Is there anything else I can assist with? No, that should be. All right. Well, thank you for calling. You can have a great day. All right. Thank you.",

Uh, yes, I did. I did. Um, uh, right. Yeah, yeah, I was calling. I, I, you're just the help desk, you're not my actual caseworker. Is that correct? Oh, I'm sorry. You were breaking up. I couldn't understand what you were saying. I apologize. Oh, uh, well, so I mean, my caseworker, my Canada caseworker, uh, called me the other day and I was having a conversation with her and, uh, I was just trying to get in touch with her again. Cause I see that she had called me and like left me a voicemail. Okay. Yeah. Um, do you know what she had needed on the voicemail? Did she state, or did she just say for you to give her a call back? Uh, she didn't even really tell me to give me a call, give her a call back, but she, uh, was, uh, something about an address. I had given her an address and, um, I think the address that I gave her was, uh, not, not valid. So I figured out what the address was, but I mean, uh, there was actually something else I had left in that voicemail, I think, maybe, but I can't really remember. Okay. Let me just, I'm going to get into your case here just to see if she case noted, um, just to see if I can answer those questions real quick. And if nothing's case noted, like she didn't need anything from you, I will put you through to her voicemail. Um, let me just get into your case real quick. Okay. What's your social security? Uh, 4 7 2 1 1 6 7 8 6. 6 7 8 6 you said? Correct. Okay. All right. Okay. Okay. Um, I'm just going to go check to see if, um, there's anything case noted in our mentor site. Um, no, the lady is helping. Okay. So I don't see anything case noted. I am going to put you through Louisiana. If she doesn't pick up, you can just leave her a voicemail. Okay. Just a moment. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Brianna. Hi Brendan is how you doing? Good. Who is this? Uh, Brandon Gill. Okay. Yeah. We spoke last week. Um, Yeah. You left me a voicemail. Telling me that, uh, Yeah, it didn't come up. I can find it. So that it wasn't, um, Yeah. I, um, I got that address. The correct address. I was close, but I was not accurate. So it's 4114. 4114. Yeah. Gable. Like G-A-B-L-E. Lane. And although it's in Woodbury, it says that it's in St. Paul. Which I don't know what county that is. Ramsey, I think. Do you know the zip code? I don't. Okay. And we're only going to be at that address for probably like another, uh, until like basically Friday or Saturday. And then you're going to be going to Rochester. Okay. All right. So, yeah. All right. Do you have all the kids with you then? Or who's with you then? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. All the kids are with me. Okay. And then in probably like 30 days, uh, that might change again. Because we might be, uh, starting the lease at that time. Okay. So where do you want me to, I mean, what. So, I just don't, I guess, know. Yeah, I mean, I'd still like you to, like, handle my case. I don't want you to, like, transfer it out until, like, I, like, I'm on the lease someplace. Right. So, um, because I was talking to my supervisor and, like, we, he was just kind of like, well, I just, because of the not knowing the address, I couldn't get ahold of you. So, he, I mean, we were kind of looking at possibly just doing a fraud referral so that we can get a verification about actually where everybody is. But, um, or who's here or who should be on. Because I look on the, on the healthcare case and there's only two kids that have healthcare, which are with her. And then you're on one by yourself. And then the other kids don't have any. Because the addresses are all different. Yeah. So, I don't know what. Well, yeah, the reason why that is, is because there was the CPS case that took, that started in, like, October of 2022. And, uh, the, my three daughters were removed for a while. They were with my mom. And then I got them back in January of 2025. And, um, yeah, I just actually learned recently, like, I learned, like, uh, last week or the week before that their insurance had lapsed. Because, uh, like I hadn't been getting any notification to reinstate it or whatever. So. Okay, so maybe they were on foster care or something like that? Yeah, yeah, because, yeah, because they were staying with my mom. They were with my mom for, like, almost, like, two years, you know. Like, almost three years, in fact. But, yeah, they've been, like, back with me since January of 2025. The case has been closed since June of 2025. Okay. And, um. So then you guys are staying overnight in the cities. Where do your kids go to school? Um, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. The two ones go to school in Woodbury. And then my oldest goes to, um, uh, their online school. Like, I think it's called Connections Academy. Okay, hold on. I want to just look up your case so I can get names. I know what I'm figuring out here. Um. Okay. Okay, so it's you, and then Ava and Ariella are online. Is that which one? Uh, are online. Could you rephrase the question? Can you tell me who's, you said, who's going to school where? Ava, where's Ava going to school? Connections Academy. Okay, and then Ariella? Uh, Woodbury. I have to double check the school. Their mom said it, so it's like Woodbury something. And Ashton? Same school. Woodbury? Yeah. And then Alexander? Uh, he's not in school. They're, they're. Not in school. Yeah. Yeah, they're a little too little for that. And then, uh, and then there's Atlas, who's also like too young for school. Not in school. So the one does online school and then the two go to Woodbury and you guys just bring them to school and then they're staying with you 24-7 or do they stay with their mom at all? Correct. 24-7. All, all five of them. You have them all? They don't have visiting time with their mother then? Uh, they do. But you sometimes stay there? Or like. Yeah, yeah, we do sometimes stay there. Okay. Because like that's the issue is like if they're on like health care with her, who's claiming them for taxes? Uh. Who's claiming all the kids? Are they all with the same mother or? No, they're with different, different parents. Okay. Okay. There's not even an absent parent panel in here. So whose parents is Ava, whose parents, who's the mother of all these kids? Uh, Kiana Stewart. Yeah. The three girls. Kiana? Yeah. Kiana what? Uh, Stewart. S-T-E-W-A-R-T. That's Ava, Ariel, and Ashton? Correct. And so they, and they stay with the mom sometimes or how often? No, we see them, we see their mom every Sunday. Okay. And where does she live? Rochester. Okay. And then, so is that where you're moving in with her next? Yeah, we're going to be staying with her for like probably like three weeks to four weeks. And then Alex and Atlas are the ones that have the mother that live up here? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, because the deal is that, the deal is that if they're like, if they're, if you're an intact family, then the mother would need to be like on the case. You know what I mean? Um, but so that's why like it's the St. Paul address. That's not with a parent, right? That's just. Yeah, no, that's a family friend. Yeah. Okay. Um. But then that's only till this weekend. Okay. Um, let me get my, are you going to be available? Can I just give my supervisor a call to find out what he wants me to do with the transfer or where to keep it or what to do with it? Sure. And call you back? Sure. Okay. Thank you. All right. Sounds good. Bye. All right.",

    "transcript": "Um, not too much. What do you got going on? Um, no, I will. So, did I tell you I got my own place? Uh, no. No, no, you didn't. I never mentioned that. It's like a duplex. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah, that's super frustrating. Right. Right, right. Right. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's super frustrating. And things are still not going good with Koda right now either. No, I won't talk to him. So there's OSP. I got him. I had to get OSP on his mom too. They keep on calling CPS on me. He keeps on doing that? His mom does. He can't call CPS on me because it's a violation of the OSP. So he has his mom do it. Really? Yeah. You have any idea what they're saying or what? What do you mean? I don't know. Has CPS like contacted you about it? About their statements? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they called. Yeah, they came to my house for me. They want a UA, not twice. They have told me that me not giving them a UA or whatever is, you know, they're going to be terminating Koda's rights. And then his mom calls and makes reports that I'm showing people Koda's sex case paperwork or whatever for his registry. Yeah. Yeah. Like, how is that fucking CPS? I'm like, this lady's fucking harassing me and you guys are allowing it. Straight up. Yeah. This isn't even having anything to do with fucking kids. But the time that they asked you to give you a UA, one of the times you didn't? No, because I take UAs for probation. If they want to go get a court order or whatever, I'll go take their UA, but I don't want a drug case open. And even if I go take their UA and it's clean and on their time that they want it, it opens up a drug case. I don't want that. They're going to want a case plan either way. I was looking into it. I talked to their attorney about it. If you take a UA for CPS, no matter what, even if it's clean, you doing that opens up a case plan. Right now it's just accusations, you know? I don't know why an attorney would tell you that. Because typically if you give them a clean UA, then they close the plan right away. Right, but if you have a drug case open with CPS at any point, they can come back in your life in a span of three years, they have to, at least once. I don't want that shit. I don't want that type of thing with CPS. I take UAs for probation. If it really comes down to it, I'll give them my fucking UA script for probation. I take random UAs for probation. But I don't want a drug case open with them. Right, but if you don't take their drug test, then it's a voluntary fail. No, it's not. If they deny it, they have the choice, they have the option to go get a fucking court order. But in order to get a judge to sign off on it, they need valid proof that the accusations against you are true. You know what I mean? If it's just hearsay, then you can't get a fucking judge to sign off on it and it closes the case. Because it's just accusations. I talked to an attorney about it. And not only that, but the person who is making the accusations is somebody who I have a fucking OFP on and it's his mom, you know? And he lives with her. Yeah, that's where he moved back to. Huh? That's where he moved back to. Yeah. His mom is way where I found him. No car, no job, no fucking nothing. He didn't get nothing out of our marriage. Yeah. Like, I swear to God, dude. He's just fucking like, I don't get it. Yeah, and where's this new place you got? It's in Osceola. Osceola? Okay. Yes. Yeah, it's nice. It's a duplex my grandpa lives on the bottom half. Oh, damn, that is nice. Yeah, but it's not connected to his. It's like an actual duplex. It's not like his upstairs or something. Yeah. You got it by yourself? Like, you're not having a roommate with other people? Nope, just me and baby. Oh, that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty excited. I signed the lease on the first. You moved in on the first, you said? Yeah, I signed the lease, yeah. I moved in. Okay. Yeah, my first actual lease, like in my name. Yeah, that's exciting. Yeah, I know. Yeah. But yeah, I don't know. Are you in the cities? No, I'm in Mora. I had like a couple of appointments today and then after this I got to do a bunch of phone calls. Yeah, I ended up, my truck's still not running because I ended up like, you know, switching the tranny out and the new tranny that I put in there like was fucked up. And so now I gotta like get a new tranny. Yeah, so I took it out, took out the bad tranny like a second time. Oh, hey, I got this doctor that just came in. All right. I'll call you back.",

I noticed that I have an appointment with you on Friday at 11. I was wondering if there's any possible way that you would be able to come after 12 o'clock that day. Friday? This Friday? Yeah. This Friday, you have an 11 o'clock appointment. Oh. And you said after 11? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Anytime afternoon. Oh. Yeah. After 12 o'clock. That should be fine.

I would recommend giving us a call then and then just hitting prompt four for the scheduling department. Let them know what you decide you want to do if you want to remove it. And we could possibly switch that Friday appointment to a removal as well. Okay. All right. All right. I'll get in touch with them. Sounds good. All right. Thank you. Yep, no problem.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hey. What's up? Uh, well, a couple things. I talked to Ava last night and I wanted to talk to you about the whole thing that she shared with you and me about school and all that. And then this morning I was giving Ashton a hug and felt something in her bra and I was like immediately, I was like, oh that's a vase. And she's like, I was like, what is that? She's like, no, it's lip gloss, mom, it's lip gloss. I was like, no, that's a vase. I'm like, show me it. She's like, why, why? I'm like, no, because I'm your mom, because I said so. I'm like, show me it. She was like, kept saying no. And I was like, don't make this a bigger deal than it needs to be. Like, fucking give me a vase. And so she gave it to me. Um, we just talked briefly because I had to bring it to school. I told her we would talk more about it after school and I figured I'd give you a chance to talk to you as well. Um, but she said she got it from a friend here at school. That's her friend, like, offered it to her and she took it. Okay, whatever. I don't really know what to make of that at the moment, but I figured I should let you know. Transpired. Yeah. I feel like we should cut her hands off. Yeah. What? Yeah. What? I said we should cut her hands off. Oh, yeah, okay. Sounds like a great idea. Did Ava tell you about our pipe just... Did Ava tell you about our pipe bursting on our fucking ceiling? No. Yeah, I woke up two days ago. Like, I thought it was the new neighbor showering and I was like, yeah, I'm like, you can hear them showering that much in there. And then I, like, went to the kitchen and I was like, wait, what the fuck is that? And I, like, looked down and there was water coming out of the pantry. And then I opened the door and it was just, like, pouring from the fucking heavens into the pantry. Yeah, the rain. And it, like, soaked everything in. Huh? The rain gods? Yeah. It was so bad, dude. Like, everything in the pantry was just fucking soaked. Like, all those boxes, like, everything in there. Like, thankfully, it didn't, like, ruin as much of our food as I thought it was going to after I, like, went through everything. But, oh, it was such a fucking mess. Like, I just finished cleaning it last night after work. Like, all the boxes and food and sweeping. Because then the maintenance people came and fixed the pipes and then left this huge mess in the pantry here. Yeah, so. It's been a fucking stressful week so far, but. I don't know. What are your thoughts about Ashton? Like, my first inclination is to, like, take her phone when she gets home. I don't know. Like, she's had it for a couple days, she said. But I don't know what the fuck to do. It's like, I feel like nothing is going to, like. Like, I don't know if that's going to even help. You know what I mean? Like, I feel like if she's going to keep doing this shit, she's just going to do it. And, like. But, obviously, there needs to be some sort of, like, punishment. Are you fucking kidding me? There's no parking. And it's, like, fucking negative 12 outside. We should probably drug test her. Because, you know, she was hanging out at Bree's. Like, she stayed the night. Like, at first, she asked to stay the night over there. And I was like, no. But then, like, Gabby said we need to reconsider. Because, like, Ava wouldn't be cool with, like, her and another person sleeping in her room. Yeah. And so I did. I can't remember if she stayed over there one night or two nights. But. Yeah, I guess it was one night. But she was there for, like, two days. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that. Yeah. And I guess if that comes back positive, then I would say, like, the next step is, like, some sort of outpatient or inpatient treatment. And, you know, like, I know that the first thought is, like, well, what about her schooling? But when you're a juvenile and, like, you are in a program like that, like, they make you do school, like, Monday through Friday. They just offer their own school. Just like, you know, if you were to be, like, in juvenile detention, you know, you got to go to school while you're in juvenile detention. Yeah. Um. Yeah. Well, I guess we'll just cross that bridge when it comes, if that's the case. But, yeah, I can. I'll take up the drug test. Okay. Um. But. So, yeah, I guess beyond that, though, like, I spoke with Ava, and it sounds like she's been struggling with the online situation. And she basically said that she doesn't want to go to school up there. And so, I mean, like, that leaves the option of her going to school down here, which, like, I'm totally fine with that. I just, I want her to be, like, successful, obviously. And, like, I told her, like, I wish she would have, like, shared this with us sooner. Because, like, before you got so far behind, like, we could have helped you, like, catch up easier and stuff. But I think that beyond the, um, just the school work aspect, I think it sounds like she, like, wants to be just in school with kids again. And, like, having that social life more. And quite honestly, since she, like, hasn't gotten a job or, like, really, I mean, she's been doing the therapy stuff, which is good. But, um, I'm going to have to reapply for insurance for all of us today. Because they can't go to therapy anymore until their insurance is figured out. But, I mean, what are your thoughts on her coming to school down here? I don't like her at all. And on top of that, um, I don't know. Like, we did talk about all that. Like, I can find out if there's, like, a school. Hold on one second. It started here. Hmm. It's right there. Okay. Um. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. So, I mean, I kind of gave her a little pep talk about that. Like, and I was like, yeah, I understand because you had, like, a bad experience. Like, you know, you're going to have some anxiety. But I think it's silly to assume that, like, you're not the type of person that can make friends anywhere. And, um. Can you still hear me? Yeah. Yeah, and, uh. Also, um. Yeah, I don't know. There's. So, like, some irritating. Well, like, there's, like, one. Fucking. Denise is all trying to get us to switch rooms again. And I'm like, fuck that. Like, I'll move out before I fucking move a room. Move out of my room. Because somebody told me to. So. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. We're, like, I'm kind of. Doing that whole looking for a place thing again. With better. I already have a place that I'm going to, like, apply. You know, if you guys moved to Rochester, you could get into a place down here. They take felons and they're affordable. Yeah. And then all we could all live in the same area and the kids could all go to school and they could just come back and forth to the houses. It would be great. And this is the biggest recovery community in Minnesota. So, for PRS work, it's a really good area to work. Yeah. And we have two Walmarts down here and other Walmarts in the area where Gabby could work. My work doesn't go down there, but I'm already starting my internship and stuff. I have an interview at Recovery Hope, so. Well, we also have lots of treatments down here as well. Yeah. But, yeah, I don't know, just a thought. I've been trying to get you guys down here, but it's a good. I don't know. I really do think you guys would like the area. And, yeah, Ava told me about the shit with Atlas, too. That's fucked up. Yeah. At the daycare. Yeah, right, right. Yeah, we just went in there. Yeah. Yesterday, we had, like, a meeting with them. About, like, where we kind of collected all the facts and the feelings. And, yeah, I don't know. Yeah. I'm pretty. I don't know. I don't know. Basically, at the end of the day, they're, like, just giving us their word that it won't happen again. And that this chick is written up. And if it does happen, like, again, or if she doesn't, like, complete, like, these requirements that she's, you know, supposed to do, then she's going to get canned. Well, like, that's just so fucked up. Because, like, it's not like there's parents there all the time to, like, ensure that that's not happening. Yeah, I know. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. I don't know. She said that, like, this lady is, like, you know, she's been there for a while. And she's, like, one of the people, one of the main people that, like, closed the building. And so, like, in other words, it sounds like, you know, no matter what, like, after 3.30, you know, she's going to be the only one around the kids. Right. And, like. Fuck that. I was, like, trying to, like, push this whole, like, you know, you guys should just get cameras. You know, if you had cameras, you know, that's, like, makes it so you guys. Right. Accountability and you don't have to, like, be, like, the one person that's, like, responsible for keeping order here. Yeah, most gay parents do have cameras that parents can, like, log into the live feed, like, at any time and, like, see the kids and stuff. So it's kind of weird that they don't. Right. I guess it's because they're, like, a smaller daycare and, like, right now, like, the law, like, doesn't legally require daycares to have cameras, but they've been at least what she said is, like, you know, every time a scholarship for, like, more electronics comes up, like, I'm applying for it. Like, this is something that's been on our radar and we just don't want to get the wrong. Like, if they say they have to be a certain way and we get, like, you know, one way and then the law says it has to be this way, then we just spent a bunch of money, you know, on cameras that we're going to have to change and whatever, whatever. So, I don't know. It sounded like I kind of understood what she was saying, but at the same time, I'm like, don't you want to get, like, something for the meantime? Like. Right. You can, you can literally buy, like, cameras from fucking Amazon for, like, $20. Like, it's not like they have to get this huge thousands of dollars fucking security system. Right. Well, I mean. Because you would need a feed. Like, I think for it to, like, be, like, you know, like, actually fruitful, it would have to be the ones that do live feed, not the ones that are, like, help brain and had, like, you know, they're, like, censored and then they'll, like, record, like, five minutes or however long the person is in camera view and then they'll turn off again. And so, I think they want, like, more continuous speed kind of camera. Right. Then they'd also have to be, what did she say? Like, hardwired into the building so that they can't be tampered with. I suppose that makes sense. But. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I got a couple of things on my to do list today as well. Still there. Yeah. Sorry. I was texting my friend. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, we're just about to drop off Atlas. So, let me give you a call back later today or something. All right. Sounds good. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Good. Good. Yeah. We should finish this conversation about Ava as well. But all right. I'll talk to you later. My. All right. Bye. Bye.

    "transcript": "Hi, this is Brandon Gillis. How you doing? Good, how are you? I'm doing okay. Say, I had a couple of questions about enrolling my student in your school and I guess I was just not sure. I see that we're like about seven miles or ten minutes away from you guys. Okay. So do we have like a choice to enroll in your school or if we're like closer to Mora High School like are we like required to like go to that Mora High School if we're like within a certain distance of them? I would think you would be able to choose which school you would want to enroll in. Okay. Are you more in the Mora district or more in the Ogilvy district? We're definitely more in the Mora. We're like less than two miles away from the high school but we've had like a little bit of... Sorry, go ahead. No, that's okay. You would be in the Mora district so you would still be able to open enroll here. It would just be considered Mora district. Okay. So like busing and stuff would be... I don't think that would be an option just because you're Mora district. Okay. I think I can have you talk to the bus garage unless they have something different but if you're considered Mora district then I don't think riding the bus would be an option. Okay. But you said to talk to the transportation. Yes, I can transfer you over to the bus garage and have you talk to either Mark or Becky. They can explain it way better than I can just because they drive bus and know all that kind of stuff. Gotcha. Okay. But if you want to talk to them first before deciding whether you want to come here or Mora that would be just fine. If you want to come here I can always email you over forms and paperwork or you can stop in and get them or whatever works best. Yeah, I was going to suggest maybe would it be possible for you to email me those forms now and then also transfer me to the transportation department? Yep, I can do that. What is a good email address? Okay, it's l-e-g-i-t g-i-l-l-e-s and it's at live like l-i-v-e dot com. All right, so I got l-e-g-i-t g-i-l-l-e-s. Yep, that's correct. Perfect. All right, well I will get those forms emailed over to you as soon as I can and then I will go ahead and transfer you over to the bus garage. Okay, cool. Thank you. Yeah, you're very welcome. Bus garage. Hi, this is Brandon Gillis. How you doing? Good. Cool, cool. I had a couple of questions for you. Okay. We are looking at starting at Ogilvie High School and I just wanted to see if our location is available for bus pickup. All right, what's your address? It's 130 Forest Avenue West and it's Mora, Minnesota. Is it on Fish Lake? I don't know where Fish Lake is. Oh, okay. So, are you in town of Mora or something? Yeah. Okay, the pickup spot is federated. We're on the corner of 65th and 23th. We do not come in to Mora. 65th and 23th. Oh, yeah, yeah, that one place. Federated co-op there out there. Yeah. By the liquor store there. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah, that's where we meet at on 7-12. Okay. Okay, okay. Yeah, that's cool. How many kids? Just one. Okay. All right. Hope that answers your questions. Yeah, yeah, that actually is. Is that something you think you want to do or? Yeah, 100%. Okay. All right, when would you like to start? So, I'm about to fill out the enrollment paperwork right now. So, I would assume if not tomorrow, it'd probably be Monday. Okay. Yeah, and then, of course, you know, our school is Tuesday through Friday for the most part. We do not have school on Mondays most of the time. Really? Yeah, we're a four-day school week. Oh, that's very interesting. Cool. All right. So, I'll just let us know when you're ready to start. We'll take care of it. So, if you guys are a four-day school week, is that like, so you guys, you said 7-23 is the pickup time? No, 7-12. Oh, 7-12. We go about a half an hour longer than like Mora for the rest of the days. We release at 3-30 instead of 3 o'clock. But, we also don't miss out every Monday, you know, because other schools do like Friday, teachers and service days and different things. That's all done on our Mondays pretty much. So, we don't miss exactly every Monday. So, we still get more student hours than most schools. You know, we just go that extra half an hour a day. Interesting. Okay. You know, like Christmas week, we do, we're going to go Monday and, you know, the days that, the weeks that have holidays in the end of the week, then we usually go Mondays. But, okay. So, interesting. Yeah, that's cool. I'm sure my kid would like that. Yeah. It works out good for, you know, appointment and different things. Yeah, definitely. So, is there any sort of enrollment process I need to work out with you? Anything I need to fill out? No, you know, unless there's some special instructions or something. But, otherwise, just be there and we'll load up and, well, we get, we do have a form to fill out. So. All right. Is that something I, is that something that the office is going to give? Sorry? I'm just saying, I'm talking to the one who kind of can, takes care of that. You want him to come down and fill out a form? No, he's down at the, I think you're at the high school office, aren't you? No, I'm at home. So, I mean, if the. Oh, he's at home. Yeah, if the office, I mean, if you have that form and it can be emailed to me, like that would be amazing. Yeah, we can email it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'll put on Becky and then she can get the email or let me know. I can, she sits at a different desk. So, what's your email? Okay. It's L E. L E. G I T. G I T. G I. G I. L L. L L. E S. E S. And then it's at. At. Live, like L I V E.com. L I V E.com. Live.com. Yep. That's easy. Oh yeah. And what's your name? Brandon. Brandon. And what's your last name again? Uh, Gillis. It's G I. Yeah, it's the same as like Gillis. Gillis. G I. It's the same as the email. He's up, he's on the process of doing that. What's the student's name? Ava. Like A V A. Yeah. And then last, same last name. Okay. Yeah. Ava Gillis or whatever. Okay. We'll email you over the form. All right. Cool. I appreciate that. Thank you. You bet. All right. Do you need any other help? No. You know. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Yep. Bye-bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Brandon. Hey, what's up? I'm talking to Gabby. Is Gabby there? I don't know. She left for work like, I don't know, like an hour ago. How'd her interview go? Um, I don't know. I didn't ask her. I assume that it went well. You didn't ask her? Are you like some kind of monster? What the fuck's wrong with you? No. Yeah. No. We're like, uh, we, we just hang out in separate rooms all day long. We're kind of like more like roommates most of the time. I don't know. Um, I think she was just, before she left, she was like, okay, change diapers. I hate you. And then that was pretty much kind of it. That sounds super, super depressing. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if it, if it works, it works, I guess. I don't know. Let's call her. Why? What are you doing? Call her. Oh, you just called her? You just called her? She didn't answer? I'm at work. You're at work? Yeah. How late are you working? Yeah. I'm at work. I just wanted to. I'm working till six, but I wanted to know how well her interview went. Yeah. Yeah. She didn't tell me, but she was, she was sure there for like a long ass time. So, I mean, I imagine that it did go well. Yeah. I don't know. She was supposed to be there at like 10 and she didn't come back until like, I don't know, like almost like fucking 1130 or 12 or something. Okay. That's a good sign. Yeah. That's what I'm, that's what I'm thinking. I mean, if it would have been bad, they would have been like, get the fuck out. All right. Well, I was just calling to check in on her and I hope you have a fantastic day. Okay. Cool. You too. I hope you do. All right. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay. Yeah, it's a shame. It's a shame. Right. Bye, Brendan. Bye, bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hi. I just finished that stuff and then I'm at Walmart grabbing diapers and whatnot. Is there anything else I need to grab? Also, are we getting EBT this month or no? Are we what? Getting EBT this month. Uh, yeah. Oh my goodness. Oh, damn it. I forgot my purse. Did I? I forgot my purse. Oh, it's full. Oh, no. I don't think I brought my purse at all. Like, I think it's at home. Hmm. I'm pretty certain I saw you leave with it. I'm pretty certain I didn't leave with it. Or it would be here because I didn't grab my purse to go inside. So I was going to use my wick to get milk because we need milk, right? Yeah, your purse isn't in the living room. It's not an entryway. It's not under some, like, jackets? No. Not here. It's not in the room? I'll go check the bedroom. No, it's not in the bedroom either. I'm pretty certain I saw you leave with it. I'm pretty sure I didn't. It's not here. And typically that's something you leave kind of out in the open or, like, in one or two places and it's not in any of those places. Well, she would have, like, unless it got fucking stolen out of my car. I'm going to have to check when I get home because it's not in my car. And I'm almost certain I didn't leave with it. It might be at Kiana's. I don't know. Because... Certainly not. Unless you think you left it at a daycare. But I know 100% I saw you with it this morning. I mean, it's possible you could have left it at a daycare. I don't just bring it in everywhere I go. You don't remember carrying anything into school with you? You just went in empty-handed? Well, I carry stuff in my hands, my folder and stuff. But, no, I don't think I grabbed it to go into school. I'm pretty sure I didn't leave with it. I don't know now. Huh. Okay. Well, I'd recommend stopping back at your school. Well, the classroom's closed and, like I said, it was just me and her in the classroom. Like, if I left it on, like... I guess. I don't know. I guess I can. There's no harm in doing that, but... I'm almost certain I didn't. Okay. All right. Well, I guess, yeah, I'm going to just grab what I can and then... Okay. All right. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Bye. Bye.",

Maybe pull the dick out of your mouth, maybe I can hear you better. Oh my gosh, that is so vulgar. Sorry if those kids are on. No, it's okay, I'm in bed. With who? Nobody, I sleep by myself. Uh-huh. You're a damn liar. Yeah, when I do sleep, once every six months. Yeah. I'm just kidding. You're also a damn liar. You are also a damn liar. Dude, I'm so sober, dude, it sucks, dude. Good for you. I'd suck a dick for a fucking pipe right now. No, I'm just kidding. Good, I got a dick for you to suck. Oh my God, that is so vulgar. That is so crazy. You deserve it. Yeah, geez. You know what I'm going to do right now? What? Crawl into my nice brand new bed and watch my nice brand new TV while I masturbate with my nice brand new toy. I don't know. I don't know what else to say. There's nothing else to say to that. Oh my God, I never lock my door. I was going to ask you, do you have a pool? No, I don't. But even if I did have a pool, I would not go in there because there's a bunch of black kids around here. No, I'm just kidding. But there's a bunch of people that do not shower. Somalians. I'm just kidding. Yeah, I get it. I got a couple of friends that live out in that area. And it's just like, yeah, I don't know. I don't know how to put it. Yeah, even showering in my own shower is questionable. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. I guess I was thinking about coming over for a little while. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I mean, I was going to just kind of randomly hit you up and come out this week. But then I found out that I have court on Thursday. I thought it was tomorrow, but it's actually on Thursday. And, yes, it just wouldn't make sense for me to go out until after I was done with the court. But, yeah, I'm supposed to start work again this week or next week, you know, whatever, kind of both. And, yeah, I still don't have a car. And I kind of need to like work. Yes, I mean, I don't have a car. But, yeah, like I work out in the cities. So, I mean, it just makes sense that if I'm going to try to fucking work, then I need to be out there. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah, if I don't start work again soon, I'm going to lose my job because my leave, like, ends. Well, I'll call you right back, kid. I've been needing to take for a while. I'll be right back. Unless you're not going to be up, then call me tomorrow. Yeah, I'll call you back. Yeah.",

How would I what? I don't, how would I get out there? I'd get dropped off. Hmm. And then, and then once I'm there, I basically have like, you know, clients and people that I work with that can kind of take me wherever I need to go. Okay. You fucking about to fall asleep on me. All right. Well, if you're going. I like hearing your voice. No, but we just see. Oh, I like that. Put you to sleep. Yeah. Well, I do miss you. I think about you all the time. I do. Oh, my gosh.

Have you heard about the mermaids or. I don't even know, dude, it's just something. Do you believe when you're in mermaids? No, I believe in everything else. Really? What if I were to show you some fucking videos of mermaids? What if I were to tell you a story about how, like. All right. I already, I already sound like a conspiracy theorist. I sound crazy. I've already, I've already lost the argument. I've already lost the last year. Yeah. Yeah. What about Garth Brooks? Do you ever hear that? I don't know. He's got like where he goes. I don't know. Like, wherever he goes, like, wherever he goes, like, people just go missing all the time. Yeah. Every place, like, he does like a show at or like, there's like, I guess, like, there's like 120 fucking missing cases or murder cases. I don't know. Some fucking comedian pointed it out. And then, like, it's kind of like caught fire where, like, now other people are, like, kind of looking into it or, or, or here. How about this? So I can. Here's a totally different one. Fucking. So I guess Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian are like beefing right now. So, like, she's, like, Paris Hilton is, like, fucking throwing Kim Kardashian under the bus, like, fucking telling everybody that, like, yeah, she's, like, used to work with Epstein and fucking. It was like fucking around with Diddy and, like, like, basically just throwing her under the bus, like, hard. And, like, and I guess, like, Chris Kardashian, you know, you know, the mom. There's, like, a fucking Rico case that's about to open up on her, like, a fucking federal case that's about to open up on her for, like, the same shit that Ghislaine Maxwell was basically. Yeah.

He's combative, Maria. You have some derogatory language, sir. That is not derogatory. That was definitely derogatory. Okay, Brandon, I need you to do something. No, I can't do it. Maria, tell him yes you do. Brandon, like or guess, because I will come and fucking beat you if you do not comply. We really need this from you. We need you to be a team player, and we love and support you so much, and we would just appreciate it a lot. Otherwise, you'll come and fuck some stuff up. What? What? Say what you were gonna say. Otherwise, I will come and fuck you up. Yeah, that's what I heard. So, the things that I asked you to do, I actually really need you to do them. You didn't ask me to do anything. Yes, I did earlier when we were bantering, and I told you, like, you better get the shovel in when you get home, and also wash the dishes. Oh, my God. I'm not doing any of that. You said you don't want me to do any of that? No, I do need you to do that. No. Listen, you're scared of your mom. I'm not. That's the difference. Dude, it's not about being scared. Yeah, it's our dishes. If it was her dishes, and I was like, oh, my God, I need you to do my mom's dishes. Like, that would be scared, but there are dishes. It looks rude that we're like, she's gonna come and try to make food in the kitchen. Yeah, because we don't clean up after ourselves. Who gives a fuck if we look rude? If anything, you're rude. I'm rude. You're rude. You're just sitting at home all day. It doesn't even give a good look. Brandon, please be a team player and do this for Gabby. Oh, my God. I would wash the dishes myself, but at the same time she gets there, then it's gonna look weird. Then I'm like cleaning right when she gets there. So, please. Yeah, fine, but you have to repeat after me. Yeah. I have no balls. I have no balls. And I am deathly afraid of my mother. And I'm deathly afraid of my mother. Yes, because the shots. She calls the shots. And I am a huge pussy. And I am a huge pussy. All right, well, you heard her say it, Maria. Now, so there's a witness. Yes, there is a witness. And I will testify in court. But you also witnessed that you said, all right, like he's gonna do it, right? Yes, I also witnessed that. So, Brandon, she did her part. You gotta do yours. Fine, but I'm leaving tomorrow evening. And you better put out sometime before that, so. Where are you going tomorrow evening? After court, dude. I have to go to the cities and I gotta work for like the next few days. After court? Who do you think? Where do you think you're getting a vehicle? Like I already have to maybe call off work tomorrow to fucking deal with this shit, Brandon. No, you can drop me off in the city. You said you have court in St. Cloud. Yeah, I know. And then we'll come back, we'll get the kids, and then you can drop me off in the cities. Yeah, and that means I already have to fucking call off work. What do you mean? What are you talking about? And then on Friday, I have work in the evening. So, like, someone needs to watch the kids. Okay, well, luckily your mom will be here. Hopefully, I'll have to ask. Yeah, make sure you point out that the dishes are done. Word to the wise. She's like all those tools. What? Word to the wise. I feel like this conversation could have gone a lot better, Brandon, if you would have asked. Hey, honey, could you drop me off in the cities after court? Man, she already knows that I need to go to work. Yeah, but go to work with crackheads. I think you're actually going to do some work in the snow. She's trying to conspire to get me fired, so she can have me as a stay-at-home dad all the time. Conspiring to get you fired? Yeah. That rhymes. I'm trying to conspire to keep you sober. You're conspiring to do drugs. Dude, where I'm going to be staying is a no-drug place. Prove me wrong. I don't have to prove shit. At Tamra's? Is that her name? That bitch does drugs? No, no, I was able to figure out that I'm most likely going to be staying with Phoenix. Okay. And Phoenix is sober as fuck. Yeah, Phoenix is also lonely and sent you kiddie pictures before. I don't know if I trust that so much. Why is that Phoenix's favorite either? Name one chick that hasn't showed me her titties, okay? Not me, I guess. It's not true either. Like, I don't know what your titties look like. Half the time we hang out, you don't even wear a bra. Yeah, I was sliding and almost died, so I missed part of that conversation. What happened? I don't know, you were defending your titties. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I said, yeah, right, like, half the time we hang out, you don't even wear a bra. Because I don't wear bras unless I'm at work, okay? Fucking priest! Sue me! Sue me! I'll... I'll sue your titties, then. Okay, and I'm confused, because I thought Phoenix was married. She was married, her baby dad's crazy. Her baby dad what? Is crazy. They couldn't even make it to their fucking one-year anniversary without him, like, having a, like, psychotic break. And, like, trying to run away with their baby. Oh, my God. Yeah, I guess it was, like, a whole situation. I don't know, you get a little sleep-deprived. Apparently the guy got a little sleep-deprived and just fucking lost his shit. And, like, next thing, you know, they're having, like, a domestic. And he, like, takes off. Like, her dad shows up, and he, like, takes off, like, running down the street. Like, with the baby in his hands. Baby's, like, a week old. Yeah, she was saying, she's like, man, I almost got, like, PTSD from, like, seeing him, like, run with the baby. And, like, that baby's head, like, just fucking getting all jarred and... And... Yeah. Which is pretty sad to hear that. But I guess, like, when her dad caught up to him, he, like, fucking took the baby from him. And, like, just beat the hell out of him. Oh, my God. Is the baby okay? Yeah. Yeah. Jeez. Dude. I would literally never speak to that man ever again. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Well, apparently, she's very compelled not to speak to him because, you know, like, I guess he's got, like, some, I don't know, some sex crime against him from, like, the past. And, like, DHS basically compelled her to, like, not contact him. Otherwise, it's gonna be, like, held against her pretty much. Yeah. Very sad. Yeah. Okay. I'll let you guys go. I've got some dishes to do. And some snowing to plow. And you've got some fucking booty to throw at me later on, so shut the fuck up. I'm on my period sweatshirt, if that's what you... Gross. If you like that shirt. You're the one that wants it. No, never mind. I'm good. You don't want your red wings, Brandon? No. No. No. No. Alright. I'll talk to you guys later.

I'll do them when I, after I get the kids, I guess. What? Why wouldn't you do it before the kids are all there and like crying in your face and stuff?

Just follow up. Can you can you hear me? Okay. Yeah, perfect. And my voice is low because I forgot to wear a jacket outside. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. You want me to call you back in a few minutes? Are you good? No, no, no, no, no. I meant like, that's why my voice is low. It's because I caught a cold. Oh, I got you. I got you. But how are you? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Um, yeah, I just kind of wanted to follow up. And I tried calling miles just now, just to kind of communicate. He was busy because he was with a client. So he said he'd give me a call back. But my next step was to give you a call and just kind of communicate as well. I had intentions of starting, you know, kind of earlier this week. But then I found out that I had like a court hearing tomorrow. So that kind of got held back until, you know, basically after that. But I also understand that there was a change that I need to communicate my my anticipated hours ahead of time. Is that exact accurate? Oh, sure. Can you still like your what the 20 hour minimum? You I mean, well, yeah, like, I don't know, like for the 20 hour minimum. Well, it kind of well from our last staff meeting, it kind of sounded like, like, I don't know, I'm going to paraphrase for a second. But it sounded like, you know, if I anticipate that I'm going to get 25 hours this week, and like, I'm gonna have to communicate that ahead of time. Or if it's going to be like, you know, something if I however many hours I predict I'm going to get for the week, I just need to communicate ahead of time is something kind of like what I understood. Yeah, that's based on like, yeah, that's based on like, PTO assessment. Oh, so whether or not like, if you work like full time, then you'd be classified as the staff that's full time. So then you have more benefits that way. And then anyone full time is 32 hours to 40 hours. Okay. But 32 is the minimum. And then part time would be like, if you're still going to continue the time. Okay, I understand. All right. So I guess I took that out of context then a little bit. Okay. Well, I just wanted to kind of communicate with you guys.

I was in a day treatment program when I was a kid and. It was bullshit. Well, when you were a kid was 25 years ago. 35 years ago. So I'm pretty sure they probably have changed some. I mean, I think it would be. Better to like, find like a short term program for her to do. Like, if it's like an inpatient program. Like that's. I don't know. Yeah. Like an inpatient program. Something that. Mike is not going to. Yeah. Yeah. Day treatment program. Not great. Well, it's five days a week, three hours a day. So it'd be like, it's not just like a.

Uh, no, I just started with this new show. It's called unbelievable. Have you ever heard of it? No. Was it? Um, is it like, like people surviving or something? No, no, no, no. It's a, it's about, uh, um, I just starts out with this, this rape scenario, rape victim, and then like how she's coping with it. Oh, that's the girl that like dialed with her toes and stuff. Yeah. And they like said that she was lying. It turned out she was, didn't. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fucking Gabby started watching the show. Like, I don't know, a couple months ago, I remember I was like really high and I was like really not interested in fucking, but then she fell asleep and it was like playing while I was like up, up, I was all cracked out. And, and, um, I don't know, as I was watching it, I kind of started to get kind of interested because like one of the detectives in there, uh, was just kind of like, I don't know, I don't know something about this person's character. I was like, yeah. So I mean, I started kind of getting into it, but like by the time I started becoming interested, I was like already like the fifth or sixth episode. So I just started watching it from the first episode and I'm like, I'm like the third or fourth episode now, but it's pretty good. That sounds like you've already heard of it because you have, because you have no life. You know what? Speaking of having no life, I'm going to go hang out with somebody tonight. I don't even know why I doubted you. Shut up. Hold on. Ashton wants to say something to you. Dad. Hey, what's up? Can I come over for Christmas? Can I come over for like a portion of Christmas break? Yeah, sure. I don't care. Okay. Mom's going on a date with a guy named Jordan. She met him up in. Yeah. He looks like Morgan Wallen. Sure. Okay. He's 31. Ashton, do you mind? Yeah. Well, at least he's not African-American. And I would say something about her. What would be wrong if he was African-American? I don't know. Only chick. Only big chicks date African-Americans. That's not even true. Anyway. Those are social security numbers. I don't know. Oh, no. Dad's 478-11-6286. Not quite, but close. It's not? What is it? 786-6786-427-11-6786. 67? Fuck my dad. We had 1738. My attention span is short. My attention span is short. So let me talk to your mom. Okay, what? Do you have me on fucking speakerphone or what? Not anymore. Why are you need to talk to me about something private? No, what? Yeah, no, no. Fucking just fucking shut up. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so what the fuck is Ava's deal? So I don't know. It's kind of fucking pissing me off. Like, not quite severely, but enough that it's irritating the fuck out of me. So I don't know. We're not shit talking. I just dad's asking me about you. And I'm not really trying to have you sit right next to me listening. It's awkward. Yes, about what school? Yeah, well, yeah. So I mean, yeah, she I mean, like, she opened up to me. She's not really giving me a straight answer. Like, I've tried speaking to her about it, too. She doesn't want to go to Ogilvy. It doesn't sound like but she doesn't hasn't said she actually really want that she wants to stay go down here either. She's like, I just don't know what I want. And I know that. Like, I need to make a decision or whatever. But I know that, like, when we spoke about her, if she were to potentially come down here, she's very like, worried about you being like upset with her thinking that she's abandoning you. So I mean, okay, so and I'm told, I guess, I was kind of like, I don't know, because I assumed that she may have spoken with you a little bit more in depth than she has had with me. For some reason, I was Yeah, the only reason I haven't like made like, just like went out and did it completely. Because it was because I assume that you may have more information than I do. But kind of, well, you don't have to. I mean, she has spoke to me more about it. But I mean, I thought she probably already shared those things with you. Is that not correct? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I'm not hearing anything that I haven't heard yet. And I ultimately, like, what I've like, kind of determined is, you know, like, you know, her main concern about not wanting to go to, you know, more high school is ultimately because of that, like, bad social encounter that she had. And I was like, you know, being receptive of that, but still encouraging her, you know, like, you know, it would be silly to assume that you can't make friends anywhere. And that and like, if you have like some sort of phobia about something, like, not that your fears aren't valid, but you should probably learn to overcome those and not let them, like, you know, form how you're, you're like, make your decisions. And so I mean, that's like, basically what I was like, trying to get her to lean into. And, and then when she's like, okay, well, and so I was like, being receptive of that. So I was like, okay, so obviously, we need to get you into school full time, you know, and back to your interacting with your peers, because I see that, you know, I described to her like the, you know, the potential downsides of like, not being as social and like, not interacting, because I was like, you know, when you become an adult, like your survival is dependent on interacting with people. And if you like learn to like, be like reclusive, and like, you're not building your social skills, then you're going to really damage your chances of success as an adult. And, yeah, so anyway, so, but that being said, I was like, okay, so, all right. I mean, I feel like, oh, I understand you don't like if there's another option besides more high school, you know, me being receptive of your feelings, I'll see if there's another option that's, you know, doable, and that makes sense. So I did find this, that Ogilvy is only like, like, it's like six and a half or seven miles away. And there is a bus that like, comes and gets her and drops her off and everything. And, and it's only four days a week. And yeah. Yeah. So okay, like, I know, she kind of, well, she didn't tell me all of that. But she told me that, like, kind of what it seemed like, what I've gathered from what she told me is that she knew that you like had, like, you had talked to her about the Ogilvy thing. But like, it was in her mind, like, she shared with you, like how she was feeling. And then you just went and did it and like, didn't even really like include her and like, talking about like, hey, this is what we're gonna do kind of thing. I think she felt kind of blindsided by it. And so like, I'm not even entirely sure if it's Ogilvy itself is like the problem, or if it's just like her feeling like you didn't care about what she thought and like just did it much like I've told her like, you know, as being like a parent, like you're not like in being the child, you're not going to always have like the final say in things like that. Ultimately, it's our decision what's best for you. But yes, like we want to take into consideration like your thoughts and feelings about things. But, um, you know, and I told her the same thing, like, just because she had a bad experience at Mora doesn't mean that just because it's a small school that she's guaranteed to have a bad experience at Ogilvy too, you know, like, I'm not just over here, like shit talking everything that you're doing. But I also felt kind of like blindsided and not really, you know, like, I feel like we try to do these things like as a team. And you kind of just did that. And just, I found out about it, like through the grapevine kind of thing. Yeah, I don't know. Well, I mean, I told her, told her exactly what I was going to do. I mean, it's silly that she says she's blindsided. I don't know. And like, when I did tell her, you know, okay, I found Ogilvy, you know, like, I'm gonna get like, you're basically signed up. I like started signing her up. But like, you know, there's still like more phone calls that need to be made. And I told her that she was signed up. And then she's like, well, didn't you talk to mom? And I was like, well, yeah, but I don't know. I didn't. That's why it kind of made me stop. And I was like, assume that there was something more to it than what you may have told me or something like that. Or maybe she had made some arrangement with you. I was like, well, what the fuck? So I don't know, I kind of felt like whatever she's... No, we never made like a... Sorry. Go ahead. Well, no, like we never made like some like arranged plan or anything like that. But like, when we spoke that night, like the first time we talked about all this, it was like, she was like, I don't want to go to a small town school. Like, I don't want to go to Mora. Like dad talked about possibly Ogilvy, but like, I don't want to go there. And I'm like, so what are you like, what are you trying to do then? Cause I'm like, if you're not going to go, if you don't want to go up there, like the other option would be to come down here. And I'm like, so like, you need to decide what it is that you like want to do. And then we can kind of go from there. But, but then we're like, I brought it up to her after like, you had like, she had said you'd signed her up for Ogilvy. Like, and we even spoke about it briefly last night. Like, she just, I don't know if she even knows what she wants. And I feel like it might be a good idea to just like, have a conversation, like with me, you, her, like Gabby, whatever. And just like, try and like really understand like what's going on, what she wants to do and like, go from there and not saying that she has the final say. But I think that if we like, I don't know. Cause like, I know that you talked to her about Ogilvy, but she said that it was just kind of like a brief, like you, she knew you never said that's for sure what was happening. So just like kind of, I think including her in the process might be helpful just because I think because she does have so much anxiety around it feeling like feeling very like out of control of the situation. I think like just trying to include her and it might help with those fears and anxieties, if that makes sense. I don't know. So here's my kind of fucking final thoughts on the subject is I feel like we're kind of fucking ourselves as parents and making our jobs harder than it has to be given her the illusion that she has a fucking say at all, because in retrospect, when we first made this arrangement with her to do online school, we told her right then, if she doesn't fucking live up to these standards and hit these fucking, these expectation marks, then this is exactly what's going to happen. So the fact that we even offered her to like, have like feelings or say in it at all is probably us just being good parents. And I feel like that at this point, that's being taken advantage of with her, assuming that she has a fucking choice at all. Well, I understand what you're saying, like where you're coming from. But I think that even if she doesn't have like the final say, like, I think it's still important to like, listen to like her, not just her, but all of the girls and like, you know, if they feel a certain way about something, not saying that that's how it's going to be. But like, like I said, just kind of including them in the process, or even if like, you've already made that decision that that's what's going to happen, then still like talking with her about it. And like, you know, just explaining and like, I don't know, just not just being like, this is what's happening. This is we're doing it. And like, that's that, like, yeah, granted, you can do that. But like, So this is, so this is what I'm saying, like, that did take place, like, we did sit down and like, Hey, how you feeling, feelings, you know, thoughts, whatever. So I mean, I, I think we've both done that. And I don't think we need to worry about continuing to do that, because we're already doing, we're already like, checking in, making assessment, collecting feelings, collecting thoughts, sharing thoughts, having those conversations, we're, we're hitting all those boxes. And I feel like, I don't know, the fact that it's been two weeks, I've been getting text messages from, like her school saying that, you know, she's not in attendance. She's like, basically dropped out on her own volition. Like I've been getting those text messages for like two, two and a half weeks now. And like, yeah, I mean, that's like, I don't know, that's bullshit. We've let a lot of that happen. I agree. And I mean, I spoke, I told her that too, that like, that whatever happens, it needs to happen like ASAP, because I'm not trying to have what happened with CPS happen again. And like, because we didn't have you in school. I'm like, I'm quite honestly, it terrifies me to like ever have be in the position to lose them again. That's what Gabby says too. So, I mean, if anything, if there's anything that I feel like needs to change, it's Ava that needs to, I mean, because Ava should have brought this to our attention fucking a month ago, a month and a half ago. I agree. I told her that as well. And also I think though that what taken into account, like, she's obviously a kid and she's going to make mistakes, but she was really scared to tell us because she thought that we were going to be really upset with her because of how hard she pushed to do online school and then she wasn't being successful in it. And like, yeah, I understand, like, you know, logically, it makes sense to like, okay, you're struggling, talk to us. But also I like completely understand where she's coming from, even though I'm like, you know, I've never been like, like angry if you're like not doing well about something like I'm always pretty calm and like so in the future, like if you are struggling, you need to tell us before it gets to the point where you're so far behind that you can't do anything about it. Yeah. I mean, I said the worst that's gonna happen is we're gonna like have to talk to you and we're gonna have to figure out what needs to happen to get me get you back on track. But no one's gonna tell you you're a piece of shit, you know? Yeah, I mean, that's what I basically was saying to her too. I mean, that night that we talked, you know, we have like a really good conversation really great. I mean, the lights were all off, which was, I don't know, a little weird, but you know, and at some point, I even like, excuse myself and went and got some fucking napkins or tissues so she could wipe her tears and because I'm a fucking sweetheart. Yes, Brandon, you're so sweet. Yeah, but now I'm just like, listen here, dude. We, we, I mean, I'm pretty confident that you're all about Oh, feelings, this feelings that but like, Yes, I am. And like, I'm not, I'm still I'm still a parent. And I don't want you to fucking think that my I'm being cross in this but like, I mean, I feel like because I've already like did all those feelings talks feelings this, what are your thoughts? What do you want me to fucking, you know, I do I did all that. I mean, I, I'm not kidding. I'm, I don't think I'm being too cross and being like, Okay, like we heard everything. Okay, but now this is what's happening. I mean, the fact that I don't think that's out of line either. I just think it's, yeah, I just think it's a matter of just like cluing her in on what's happening, like as it's happening kind of thing that like play by play necessarily but yeah, like we'll sit and we'll talk with her and tell her like, Okay, we heard everything you're saying, but this is what we're gonna do. And, you know, I mean, you could remind her, I mean, you're, you're gonna probably talk to her obviously before I do but reminder that, you know, this isn't like a something that I just dropped on her because this is exactly I mean, when we originally talked, you know, if this didn't work out, it was going to be immediately going back into more high school. And the fact that I like, like, was putting her in a different school, that's me being considerate of our conversations that we had. So I mean, I know the fact that she's like, given, like, bucking that is a little frustrating for me because I'm like, What the fuck? You don't get to buy something. I'm just curious. Why are you so against like, if she would want to come down here with the girls and like all of them go to like the same school area? I mean, because to me, it is already kind of super apparent that you've got your hands full right now with the two of them. I mean, yeah, oh, that's what I wanted to tell you, too, because that's what you told her. And she was like, very, I could tell she was very, like, upset by that. Because, like, I told her, I'm like, you know, it's never, I have three kids. At the end of the day, I have three kids and having all three of them is never like something I can't handle. Like, yes, it's stressful from times but like, that's what I signed up for when I had kids and like, her being here would never be a burden or like too much for me to handle. Well, I feel like for you to say that. That's the way that my words got twisted around to come to you, but because we were joking about it. I'm just saying in the future, like I would like if you would like, talk with me about these things too, because it did kind of frustrate me. No, I'm talking about like, when you just made the decision that she was going to Ogilvy and like, didn't talk to me about it or anything. That was frustrating. Before, I didn't know that you were even looking at Ogilvy until Ava told me you were signed, you'd signed her up for it. Like, I called you that one morning and talked to you about it. Would it have been a surprise if I fucking just signed her up for Mora and like, told her to fucking suck it up because that's what we originally told her was going to happen? Maybe because like, I don't know, I just, I try to like clue you in and keep you in the loop on things. And I feel like that's kind of just out of respect. And like, I would appreciate it if you could like do that for me as well. I feel like trying to fight with you. I feel like you should have just known that that's what was going to happen because we already talked about it. That's not like fair for you to say. I should just know, like, it's, I don't just know things all automatically. That's weird. I thought you were just supposed to know things. Oh my God. Whatever. FYI, Ella is grounded from her phone right now. What the fuck? What's that? How come you don't do the whole fucking, oh, well, call your dad. Because I don't know, every single time, every single time I've ever taken a kid's phone away, I'm like, okay, call your mom. It's the last fucking call you're going to get. Well, because it wasn't intended to go like this. It was supposed to just be like, so what happened was that she didn't do her chores. Like, and this isn't the first time that I've like asked her to do something and they don't do it. And like, I haven't made a super big deal about it yet, but we've like talked about it, whatever. Well, then tonight I came home and she did like the bathroom, but she didn't have her room clean. And like, I've still been making them have their room clean on Fridays. Cause that's what we all agreed upon earlier this year. And she didn't clean it. And she was just like laying in her bed on her phone. And I was like, okay, give me your phone. And she's like, I was like, no, like, well, yeah. And then I went back in there. I'm like, what are you doing? She's like, not cleaning my room. And I'm like, why not? She's like, well, I already lost my phone. I'm like, did it ever occur to you that I might give it back to you if you just did what I asked you to do? And then I don't know if it was when I was in the shower or what, but she just went after she cleaned her room. She just went and took her the phone. Back off the counter and didn't even speak to me about it. And in the meantime, I'd made dinner after working for 10 hours today. And she refused to come out and eat and was like being rude to me and wouldn't speak to me. So then I went back in there. I was like, cause I said something about her phone and Ava's like, oh, she's on her phone. And I was like, what? So I went in there and I tried to talk to her and she just stared at me and wouldn't speak. And then I was like, well, you need to speak right now. Otherwise you're just going to give me your phone back. So I'm pretty inclined to just take your phone for longer now, since you didn't speak to me. So I'm pretty inclined to just take your phone for longer now, since you just decided you were going to go take it back without even talking to me. And she's like, so I was like, okay. So I was like, so are you caring to make a case? And she just like did some whatever she was on her phone and then handed it to me. I was like, what are you doing? She's like, here's my phone. I'm like, so you would really just rather lose your phone for longer than just speak to me and have a conversation. She's like, yep, pretty much. I was like, okay, whatever. So that's where we're at with that. I was so pissed, dude. I wanted to punch her in the face. I'm like, are you fucking kidding me? Like, I just worked my ass off all day. Come home. Go to the grocery store after work. Come home. Make fucking homemade chicken fajitas for you to be like, no, I don't mean I can't eat that. I don't want that. And then just respect me and go and jack her phone back after I took it from her. Like, what? You got to be fucked up. Few things that's going to fly. So yes. And then Ashton, she was just got her phone back after not having it for a week from all that other stuff. But she didn't have that last weekend when you were over. But yeah, whatever. Now she has it back, but she can't remember her passwords. She's still locked out of it. Oh, yeah. Because that's right. When we were at the house, she fucking she's like, I just changed my password. And it was like this fucking 12 digit fucking password. Yeah. What a dumbass. Gabby has to bring her shit when she comes like for her computer so she can hook it up to it and like unlock it through her computer. But yeah. Anyways. Well, we can talk more about this later. I got to get I'm about to be leaving here in a minute. And I want to talk to the girls before I head out. But yeah, but no, I didn't. I would have had her call, but I didn't intend on her doing things the way she did. I thought I was just going to give it back to her when she was done cleaning and she got her attitude back on track. But no. Yeah. So I don't know. How long do you think I should take it from her? Like a day? Like a week. A week? Yeah. Yeah. Fucking disrespect is disrespect. Make an example. Ashton just lost her phone for a week for fucking smoking weed and vaping and shit. Not doing her chore. Well, disrespect is fucking paramount. I told her, I was like, when you just don't do what I ask and you just blatantly do whatever you feel like. I'm like, it makes me feel like you don't respect me at all. Yeah. I mean, let's add it all up. I mean, so that's disrespect, insubordination, fucking what do you call that? Like lack of communication, fucking bad attitude, like not following directions. Unappreciative. Yeah. And fucking disrespecting you for your fucking cooking efforts. I mean, all those things. Those are fucking things. Yeah. Yeah. I suppose. I see what you're saying. I feel like maybe five days would suffice. Yeah. Fine. But then, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, explain to her why that is and then encourage like, okay, I would like you to fucking consider the effort that it takes to make food for you guys. Consider what communicating could have done to make the situation better and fucking following the rules, all these other things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to talk about it with her tomorrow because she's clearly in no position to want to talk to me right now. Yeah. And on your part, great job. Sorry that this shit stresses you out. Also, I'd like that protocol kind of followed the same way I did it with you. If it comes up and like the thing that you got to take their phone away, like immediately, okay, call your dad and let them know. All right. Well, I think if you want that for me, then you should include me on decisions that you make as well. You can suck my ball sack. Like I will never touch your ball sack. You fucking asshole. Yeah. Right, dude. If I wanted you to lick my asshole, you probably would do it. You're disgusting. I'm not. Ava just goes, I could have gone the rest of my life without hearing you say that. What did I tell you about putting me on speakerphone? You're not on speakerphone. Okay. All right. She just heard me say it. I gotta go. I'll talk to you later. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hi. I'm Rebecca. Brandon. What are you doing? I'm laying in bed. I'm watching this TV show. Dude, this TV show fucking got my attention, dude. I'm like sucked in. Like I can't stop. Oh yeah? Yeah. Oh, sounds interesting. It is. It's alright. It's okay. I mean at first I thought it was fucking wack, but back when I was like fucking super high, I fucking tried watching it. But anyways. Oh, and now that you're not? Yeah, now that I'm not and like my ADHD is like, like tempered, like I don't know. Yeah, it's got me. It's got me going. Got me going. Sounds high. You're busted. You can't hide it from me. Don't you lie to me either. Don't lie to me. Me liars. Nothing worse in this world. You're a fucking liar. No, I don't lie. What do I got to lie for? Are you my PO or my judge? No, I'm not gonna lie to you. No, no. I was supposed to fucking come over yesterday. Yeah, where were you? I don't fucking come over to people's houses that I don't fucking talk to first. Oh. And by the way, I've got a bunch of running around to do so now I finally get that. Yeah. Oh my god. Are you smoking? Yeah. Oh my god. That's terrible, dude. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I guess. My plan was if I can come over and kick it like today and tomorrow. Now you're probably just gonna have to wait until fucking Monday if I'm gonna come out to her. Oh yeah, I guess you don't have a vehicle. I'm sorry. Yeah. You're all the way up north. I forgot. Yeah. You know, you're more than welcome to come out here and get a hotel room. Yeah. You want me to tell you how my day went today? I do. How did your day go? I worked till five o'clock. Which is like an hour later than you usually do. No, I worked my normal time. But as soon as I got off of work, I had to fucking run home and then I had to go meet a couple people and then I had to fucking come all the way out to Zimmerman and then fucking I went and stopped at my friend's house and then I went to Walmart and I'm just finally getting done now and I'm so exhausted. I can't wait to go to bed. Yeah. So like you would have had to do all that running around with me and. No, I wouldn't have. I'd be fucking sitting at home. I'd be sitting at your place because yeah, when you go to work. Yes. I just like touching all my shit. No, I wouldn't actually be. I most of the time if I'm down in the cities, I can work. I'm just kidding. I want you to be. I want you to be my own body. I need to cook me food and be a wifey. That's what I'm saying. I was thinking if I come back, I'd like get some groceries for the week and fucking, yeah, just kind of be like your homie. Yeah, you can't. You can't fucking get a ride out or a fight. What are you talking about? Yeah, of course I can. What do you mean like tonight? No, not tonight. Tonight's too late. But like, yeah, on like Monday or even maybe even like Sunday night, I'd probably get dropped off. Why not tomorrow? Well, because on Sunday I go and I, Sunday's like my family day where I go and like all my kids meet up with each other and you know, we like have dinner. We do that every Sunday. That's cool. Yeah. So you're saying you don't want to leave for the week or get stranded? What are you talking about? No, I am going to be, I'm going to be stranding, I'm going to be stranding myself there Monday through Friday. Yeah. Yeah. And if for some reason you get sick of me, I got, I got other people in the area Yeah. Yeah. But the thing is, you have to answer your phone. Yeah. Oh yeah. And then I, and then I switched into a new phone. So my phone was down for a while because I don't get text messages and I don't ever go on fucking Facebook or Messenger. And I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I don't, I just, like, you have to call me. Okay. I'm sorry. I know I feel bad. I feel bad. But I just, I avoid the social media like the plague that every once in a while, I'd be like, Oh yeah, I got that thing about social media and I'll go back on it. I'm sorry. Yeah, no, I too am not, I don't use social media. Like, I basically use it so other people can get a hold of me. Yeah. So what's that? What else is up with you? Just been kind of a little bit more stressed out lately. Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm just tired. I'm on these meds and they just make me tired all the time. What kind of meds? Stuff to help you with your bipolar? Yeah, pretty much. Antipsychotics. Are you for real? Yeah. It makes me really tired. Why are you laughing? And I'm getting fat. Because you're right. Yeah. I mean, what does a psychologist or some doctor give them to you? What are they? Oh yeah, because I think I'm crazy. Expand. I went through a little issue where I felt like there's bugs all over me, which I still believe there was, but I don't know, they call it like Margillis disease or Margillis disease. Something like that. You have to Google it. So, I mean. I got really depressed there for a while and I was really stressed out and I think that triggered it. And you're. And I'm allergic to something that makes me feel like that where my skin just felt like it was crawling. Yeah, yeah. I remember like when you were still living in Elk River, you were saying something about like, you know, you touched the insulation and you just fucking. Yeah, well, I thought it was fiberglass. Yeah, well, no, I cleaned some metal fucking old tin thing off because it was like an old tool thing and I was like covered in all these like tiny little hairs, like microscopic hairs. I didn't know what it was, so I just assumed it was fiberglass. But now I'm trying to think that maybe it was like some sort of fucking bug or parasite or something. I don't know. So, are any of these, like, so have you been experiencing these symptoms while like completely sober or some like uppers have anything to do with it or not that I'm disappointed? Yeah, sure. Sure they did or do. Yeah. Is it something you've been getting into like consistently? Well, yeah, I mean, like I quit for like three or four days and it was still happening. So, I mean, it is what it is. And I started medicating myself, anti-parasite meds, and I was seeing things come out of my body that were just fucking disgusting. And it felt like there was something in my ear. I was ready to kill myself. And some things did come out of my ear, but no one will believe me. I still have them too. Yeah. Yeah, and it was just terrible. It was like the worst time of my life and no one would believe me. And doctors thought I was crazy and they were about to put me in the psych ward. But like my ear was clearly there was something in there and they just would not. They just they're like clearly it's swollen and all that. They said that I was making it up in my head, which was making my ears swell up and look like that. I'm like, you guys are fucking dumb. But I took the anti-parasite meds and I started feeling a little better and feeling like, you know, whatever. And then for shits and giggles, I just was like, OK, fine, I'll take your fucking meds. Because when they told me I could have Morgellons disease, I had like fibers coming out of my skin. The more I looked into it, the more I Googled it, the more I believed them. And hands down, I come in a couple of support groups and stuff that it for sure is everything that I'm experiencing or have experienced is exactly what like these thousands of people all experience. So I have shits and giggles. I started taking these meds and we're on the same time as the parasite meds. So I don't know which one is working and which one's not, but it's working. Yeah. So this is like so like the peak of this. So I mean, so it started so like the whole fiberglass thing, I remember was probably like close to like five or six months ago. And I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. I'm going to die. Five or six months ago now, but it kind of you're saying the whole thing kind of peaked about two, three months ago. And now, like, since your meds are kind of starting to balance out, I think you've kind of felt pretty normal the last like month or so. Yeah, pretty much in a nutshell. Yeah, it's all been going on since like May 10 is when I when I quit my job and all pretty much high related stress. And that was around the time where I had that incident with all the tiny little hairs. And then around that time, I was bit in the ear by something. And yeah, just all these things happened at once. And I don't know what to blame it on. But there most definitely was something in my ear. And but it looks like fucking it looks like thread, threadworms. Yeah, that's what they look like. And I was like constantly being attacked by like these silvery hairs. I see. And they were everywhere, like everywhere I went. And it's like, I know. And I was pulling hair out of my ears constantly. Yeah, like long hairs, long, long hairs that aren't supposed to be in there. And the second I touch them with like my bare skin, my skin burn. Like I like I got contact dermatitis from it. And when you are like allergic to something or whatever, like you can get the creepy crawlies. Yeah. Yeah, it was like the worst. Probably worse than prison. I don't know. Pretty comparable. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Yeah, like, again, I'm sorry that you had to experience all that. Not to like, I mean, it does kind of make. So in comparison, like, I mean, I guess obviously my troubles aren't exactly like that. But I did. I don't know. So like right around like fucking October. Yeah, like the beginning of October. Basically, I don't know. Kind of like when my transmission went out of my truck. Like there was like a few days where because like at first, so like the transmission went on my truck and then like I was like trying to fix the transmission like while it was like still down in the cities. And then my truck ended up getting vandalized. And then I moved it. I had it moved to like, you know, up north. Like I towed it from like the cities to up north. And I started and I fixed the transmission, redid the transmission at somebody's garage. So I mean, all the all that like took place and like probably about five or six days. And I didn't even really realize it. But like those five or six days, like I was like off of my meds. And I totally didn't even fucking think about it. But like, you know, I eventually brought my truck back to here in Mora. And I don't know. Then it kind of became like a little bit of a money pit. And long story short, like I fucking like just became so incredibly like depressed, like, I don't know, like, I don't know, just totally lost, lost for life, like hopeless, you know, just not firing all cylinders, like couldn't get out of bed. And like, I couldn't like fix myself. Like it wasn't just my normal self. And that was going on for probably like, I don't know, like close to two months. And like, it got like so bad. I was like starting to think to myself, I'm like, shit, dude, like, am I like bipolar? Like, do I need to like go into the doctor and like, fucking like start talking, having these sort of conversations? Like, am I like, do I have like some long fucking diagnosis that I've never really addressed or something like that? But then I like started taking my meds, my ADHD medicine again. And yeah, within like four or five days, like I started to kind of feel like my normal stuff self again. And yeah, so I mean, so yeah, probably about like last like three or four weeks, like I've been like feeling back to normal, but I had no fucking idea like what coming off of that medicine would fucking do. Like, it's crazy. Yeah, I don't know. It really had me fucked up. Like, because I like, I go to therapy and all that shit. And I don't know, I wasn't even going to therapy for a little bit there just because I was like, just so fucked up. But I feel better now. But I was like, really close to like checking myself in. Yeah, I like I had to take leave from work. Like, yeah, because I was like, just definitely not even fit to go to work. Now I'm good. Yeah, but now I'm good. Yeah, I'm good, too. But I'm so tired all the time, even when I'm up, I'm tired. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, I see. But I'll give you some Adderall and see if that fucking helps. All right. Oh, I got Adderall. I always prescribe Adderall. Well, he doesn't want to prescribe me Adderall anymore because he thinks that's what made me go crazy. Oh. Oh, sorry. So yeah, well, I mean, that does that would make sense. Honestly, chemicals work differently in everybody. Like, I don't know, over the years, like when it came to like smoking dope and all that stuff, like I always kind of counted myself blessed because like some of the normal symptoms that people get, like are some of those side effects like that I never got. Like, I never get like paranoid or like, I don't know, some of the other side effects that come along with it. I don't know. I feel like my body is like one of those, but like I need like that stimulant. Otherwise, I don't know, I'm just, I don't know, totally in a wheelchair without it, to be honest. Like, I can't do a lot of things that I want to do, like computer work. Like, I don't know, I can kind of gauge myself. Like, yeah, I don't know if I'm not, if I don't, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. It's kind of a long story, but I'm glad that you're doing much better. I'm glad that I'm doing better. I know that our things aren't very comparable because you probably sound like you've been kind of through a lot more. Yeah, it's been crazy. That's for sure. So what are you on your way back home right now or what? Yeah, trying to figure out how to get my contacts back on my phone without backing up all my data from my old phone. Use up all my data. You have an iPhone? Yeah. And you don't want to put on, you don't want to put your old Google account back on your phone or something? I did, but I just don't know how to put on my, get my contacts out of Google. How do you do that? Well, if you still have your old phone, then you just got to like sync like your Google account, like whatever it is, like on your iPhone. It's like, I know on an Android phone, like all I have to do is like go into my Google account settings and then like hit back up. And I'm assuming that you probably could do the same thing on an iPhone, like go to your Google account. And then once you put that, the same Google account on a new phone, like it, once everything syncs, then the contacts and like your emails and your calendar stuff, like goes back on the new phone. Yeah. See, I tried to back up my phone, but it was taking like four or five hours. Oh, really? Yeah. Like I was so close to being all the way out of data. I couldn't even take any photos and my phone slowed down so much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I don't know. And that's probably another thing. Like the downside about iPhones is like with your iCloud, like all your photos, like they either like take up room on your phone or they take up room in your iCloud. And with Google Photos, like if you just open up Google Photos and like sync it with that, then you can actually like free up all your space that your photos and all your stuff would be taken up. Because I have like, I have like 300 gigs of like pictures and videos and all that shit. But I, yeah, I obviously couldn't keep that all on my phone. I have to have it up in a cloud. Yeah, I got like probably the same like 4,000 photos. It's on my iPhone, but that's just a little sassy taking so many pictures of my ear, right? So you have like 1,000 photos of your fucking ear? Yeah, and all the bugs that I was seeing. Yeah, damn. Yeah. Huh. Just let them run. Still, that's like 45 minutes away. Yeah. That is. What? Oh, what? No, no. Zoom in. Well, you said you were in Zoom in earlier, but now you're on your way back to Minneapolis. Yeah, I just got back. Good. Oh, good enough. I'm doweling Avenue North. Okay. Close to north side. I could fucking spit, spit over north. Yeah, like it was. Yeah. Sure. I miss you. Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, I fucking miss you. Why, Anne? I can't believe you don't have a car. Huh? I can't believe you don't have a car or a ride or you can't steal someone's vehicle and do that. I can't believe you don't have a car. I can't believe you don't have a car. I can't believe you don't have a car. I can't believe you don't have a car or a ride or you can't steal someone's vehicle and use it for the night or tomorrow. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I kind of have to like plan, plan things accordingly, which is kind of shitty. Yeah. I could, I could get dropped off on Sunday night because that, that would make sense. Because I have to drive through the cities because I'm going to Rochester on Sunday. And then I could like make arrangements to just get dropped off Sunday night. That way I'm like, like in the cities and you know, available for work on Monday. Oh yeah. Oh. Oh, you're supposed to trust you're not going to bring anyone over to my house. Oh, I'm dumb. I'll be. No, it's fine. Yeah, you, you, you broke that last time I told you not to get anyone in my car. Oh my God. You're such a female, dude. Like. Yeah. Never forget anything. Well, that's how we go. I should be able to bring all the crackheads to your house. I feel like after all, that's who I work with. Is it? Well, I mean, people in recovery that is. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's not worth me working with people that are still fucking. But actually that's, that's kind of what the idea is. It's not, you, it's not worth me working with people that aren't sober, but what I've found out getting into this is it's actually kind of frequently frequent that like, you know, I'll work with somebody that's like an alcoholic that like, you know, they don't really have much success in complete abstinence. So, I mean, they'll sometimes I'll like meet up with them and they'll like be under the influence. They're not like sloppy drunk or anything like that. But I had to like talk to my supervisors about it. I'm like, yeah, this is kind of something I wasn't expecting. Like, and I kind of just made rules for myself. Like if, so if there's like somebody that I'm going to work with that like their drug of choice is like meth, then like I make like rules for myself where I'll like, like I'll only meet with them like at the office because I have an office like probably like six blocks away from, you know, 10 blocks away. I don't know. It's on like 12th and Harmon. Y'all, y'all know where that is? 12th and Harmon? Yeah. Yeah, I'm like so close to 12th street. Yeah, yeah, because if you live over by Derek, then yeah, I know, I know where you live. Yeah, you're like. Well, I live right next to the Lowry bridge. Yeah, yeah. So you are, yeah, you're probably not even 10 blocks away from my office. Yeah. What treatment center is it? I don't work for a treatment center. I work for, they call it an RCO, like a recovery community organization called Generation Hope. So yeah, I have like an office like right in town that I bring people to, but I don't know, typically that's typically like if I just, if I'm like worried that they're going to be high. Otherwise, you know, I'll meet, I'll like meet them wherever in town, you know. Yeah, it's most definitely not safe for you to come around me then. If I can come around you wherever I feel like, come on, whatever I feel like. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, and I feel guilty. I didn't go see my mom. I live right across here from Psycho Susie's, or the old Psycho Susie's. I guess it was spelled out. Oh, I know you don't. The big Ferris, the big Ferris wheel at the Lowry bridge, like, I mean, that's your apartment. Send me your fucking address, dude. It's 20 Lowry. Okay, hold on a second. And right on Lowry. Can I unlock my phone? I guess super cool, they're a cute apartment. And I got a gym in my basement, or in the downstairs, that bike room, and other bikes. Okay. Oh, yeah, dude, that's right. I've, wait a second. Fuck. This is not where I thought you lived at all. Or wait a second. Why is this my, my fucking shit upside down? Uh, oh, okay. 20 Lowry Northeast. Yeah, I got it. Yeah, you'll be pretty proud of me. I got all my old shit now. I just went and spent a bunch of 100 bucks at Walmart, and got a new car. I spent a bunch of 100 bucks at Walmart again. Every time I go, it's just a couple hundred bucks. I wanted to get new trash cans, even though I got a million trash cans. But I had to get ones with lids on them. Me and Andy ran out of gas on this, on this bridge. Can you hear me? Oh, shit. Oh, hello. Yeah. All right, can you hear me? Yeah, sounds like you. Okay, that's fine. I'll talk to you soon, okay? All right, bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello? What's up, Troublemaker? Nothing. Is that work? What's up? How long do you work till? Till late? I work at the first location till 4 and then I get off at 4 and then I have 30 minutes to grab some snow pants and get to Sartell to do the country lights or whatever until 7-ish. Okay. All right. I was just trying to figure out about like this dinner thing or whatever. Right? Yeah. I mean, I guess if you start making dinner at like 7-ish. I'll be home at 8-ish. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. All right. How's everything going over there? It's going okay. Um, I got me and the boys got all of our gear on and went outside and we went like on the side where that has like the thrift store and that church over there like next door is like putting on this event this Christmas event for like toddlers. So like a couple of moms and grandmas like approached us while we were out front and they're like, hey you there like you guys should come in like we're doing this event for toddlers and you guys are fucking more than welcome. There's food and there's toys and there's candy and games and cookie making and so after the second mom came out, I was like, okay. Yeah, I will come in. We'll come in. So like all I had to do is like point in the direction of like and both the boys are like, yeah, fuck. Yeah, let's go check that out. Yeah, and we went in there for a while and and we're, you know, kicking it and then in there and I was like talking to the couple of the old ladies, you know, flirting and whatnot. Yeah, and then it kind of seemed a little bit like I don't know little baby might have been kind of vandalizing some of the games a little bit. So I was like, okay, I think we probably get going. It was nice talking with you guys and then got all their gear back on and then we went outside to the usual Hill that we go to and we were out there for I don't know like another 15 or 20 minutes and then we just came back in cute. He was vandalizing. Yeah, he just I don't know. They had like they're doing like this kind of like bowling sort of thing. I don't know. It kind of looked like beer pong but with candy and in it and the cups like kind of lined up like bowling pins. So I don't really fully understand what the game was all about but he kept on like want to like run up to the cups and like take stuff out of it and then like run off and like that is funny. I don't know. I mean it and then there's like a bunch of little girls there that are probably like, I don't know ranging from like 7 to like 9 years old and they're like, I don't know. They just like play with the boys like their dolls. So they're helping him get his gear off and put his gear back on and like corralling them and chasing after them. So it kind of worked out nicely for a little bit. That's so cute. Do you take any pictures? No, no. No, I told you I was flirting and why would I want evidence of that? What do you mean evidence of that? Like who the evidence would go to me and you're already fucking telling me so you might as well have taken pictures. Yeah, I don't know. Okay. Well, anyway. Well, that's fun. You like this? Have some fun. Still. Where's your snowball? What's he eating? Snowball. He brought a snowball. Are you in? What? How would you let him bring a snowball inside? Now? It's all wet everywhere. I don't know. I don't see the snowball anywhere. So maybe here. There's a big puddle. All right. Well, clean up. I know it's probably a fucking mess in there. It's not. It is. It was already a mess before I left. You're a fucking mess. You're a mess. All right. Yeah, I'll be home around eight ish. Okay. All right. Bye.",

I'm on my way to my dad's because I can't get high after today. Because of what? I can't get high after today. So I'm gonna go there and he's gonna hang out with the baby for a night or two while I get some good sleep because the baby's teething and he's been up every single night. All night long. Like, no sleep. Oh really? I'm sorry to hear that. Terrible, dude. Like, oh my god. Dude, I seriously, Brandon, I shit you not, dude. The first night that it happened, I thought that he got, like, second, like, I don't know, second contact high or something like that because he was up all night and he wouldn't stop moving, you know? Yeah. I was, like, freaking out, dude. Like, I fucking had, like, a whole fucking freakout moment and, um, yeah. All bad. Yeah. I'm coming over tonight. Huh? I'm coming over tonight. I'm not home. Yeah. I mean, it's not like I'm coming over, like, right now, but in a couple hours. I'm gonna go to my dad's for the night. You gotta come see my new place. You gotta bring Gabby too. What the hell? She just helped me out really fucking. I really needed it, dude. Wow, what do you mean? Was she, was she borrowing you some money or something? Yeah, she borrowed me 40 bucks until fucking, so I could get my ID. I just got a job at Domino's. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. Yeah, but I have to get a valid ID, so I fucking, and it was $41 to renew my ID. Yeah, yeah, that's right. The price just went up a little bit ago. I couldn't even believe it, dude. I was fucking pissed. I had somebody who owed me the money, but they wouldn't be there till later on in the night, and I was like, dude, I fucking cannot wait. I have to get this ID so I can get working, so I can afford my rent. Did you hear I got into a place? Yeah, I know. That's what I'm fucking trying to, I'm trying to come kick it. I'm gonna be in the cities all week. Huh? I'm gonna be in the cities all week. Perfect. I have to get sober after tonight, so I'm gonna go sleep it off for like two days, and then I'll probably be back home. Do you want to meet up then? No, I want to meet up tonight. Well, I'm going to my dad's in Ham Lake for a couple nights. You can come there if you want. Yeah, and then like- Depending on what time it is, we can even go to my house, but we'll see what time it is. Okay. I have to see my bill in 45 days. I cannot get high up like I've done. All right, that's perfect. So I'll come over- I'm waiting for my final hot reel to wear off. Well, if there's hot reels there, that's when I get there, that's fine. It's been fucking a couple months for me, and I'm fucking totally jonesing. Yeah, I don't have anything. That's fine. I'm not segregating. It'd definitely be good to see you, and I want to check out your place, and I'm going to be down in the cities all week. Yeah, we'll have to plan something. Yeah, like fucking tonight. I'm coming over there tonight. Yeah, all right. Well, let me know. I'm going to my dad's. Meet me at my dad's first. All right, well, give me the address. Give me the address. Okay, I will. Oh, dude, do you know what fucking- Do you know what code is in jail right now? Ah, no, no, I don't know. Why would I be- I'm not surprised. He hasn't been fucking posting anything on Facebook lately, and he's usually fucking posting. Yeah, I know, but he got arrested for the post that he was making about me on Facebook, and he offered a friend of mine $400 for my address. Yeah, dude, that guy's always fucking posting some stupid shit. Dude, I don't know. Yeah, they fucking finally arrested him for all this shit, and then him just trying to offer people money for my address and shit. He's sitting in Hennepin County Jail. He's been there since Thursday. Damn, yeah. I don't know. That's not funny. It's not something to laugh at, but at the same time, I mean, like, fucking- Yeah, in order to fuck him. Talk like a little pimp on Facebook. Why don't you be a little pimp, then, in Hennepin County Jail? Fucking stupid. Yeah. Fucking Hennepin County Jail sucks, too. I know. Fucking 23-in-1. Huh? 23-in-1. Like, when you're- I don't know, whenever I've been to Hennepin County, like, they keep me locked down for 23 hours a day, except for one hour. I've never been there, like, long enough. I've never been there, like, longer than a week. You've never been there? No, I've never been to Hennepin County, no. Yeah, I've been there, like, twice, but I usually get out within, like, two or three days. Yeah, I heard that they don't even, like, arresting people to get them there in the first place when they're sober, but- That's kind of one of the good things about Minneapolis, though, is, like, you have to be doing something, like, fucking really ridiculous in order to get, fucking, police attention in the first place. Oh my god, do you remember my friend Ryan? Maybe, maybe. The fucking- the retard one, the one that's just, fucking, like, retarded, straight-up slow. Yeah. He's always causing some shit. He got shot, and he's like, He's always causing some shit. He got shot, and he's like, Oh, really? Yeah. Damn, that's crazy. Hey, I gotta- I gotta pull these kids out of the fucking bathtub. Send me the address, though. Okay. Hey, is Gabby there? Uh, she's not, like, right next to me, but yeah, she's gonna be dropping me off. Okay, well, tell her I said I love her. She's fucking awesome for helping me out. I really appreciate it. All right, I'll let her know. All right, bye. All right, bye.",

I mean, he's the nicest guy in the world, but I just feel really high right now. You feel really high? Yeah, like high off laughing gas. Like I just left the dentist's office or something. Oh, funny. Yeah, I'll probably call him after I get off the phone with you. Yeah. So, you're bored or not bored? No, I'm not bored, but I do have stuff on the list that you wanted me to do that I was gonna do. Oh, yeah. What are you doing? Well, I could do... I guess my next thing, I'm gonna do this phone call, but then you could either tell me where the nearest fuckin' flyers are or I'm just gonna start putting on this fuckin' showerhead light by hand. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, my drill is in the first closet closest to the door. Yeah, it's closest to the door. Would I find more than just that? All the tools are in that one spot? Yeah, well, it's in that... It's a clear plastic bin. That's where the tool, my drill is, and then I have a toolbox in there you'll see, too. That's where all my tools are. Okay. Yeah, pretty much everything you need is gonna be in there, but you don't need a drill for anything, I don't think. No, I don't. I kind of just need, like, a pliers and... Yeah. And my... Oh, there's a pliers in the junk drawer. In that junk drawer, there should be. In the kitchen? Otherwise, yeah, in the kitchen. Otherwise, in both of the spots I told you. I have a... I'm trying not to put any holes in the walls. So that's... TV mount and all that. Which, I need to buy a TV mount thing for my bedroom.

All that stuff outside I need to wipe down, but I can't show you my process. It's a little bit harder to understand now that you're on, like, Bluetooth. What did you say? All the stuff outside? Yeah.

So because you were out of the office for a number of times, an LABC meeting is required prior to seeing any clients. So I had to look up some of the documentation around that. And then the second thing is that you had an agreement with AVAC that your pay increase was subject to, or not subject to, was contingent to you working in St. Cloud. Is this still a possibility? Yeah. Yeah, I've been in communication with the two clients that were my repeated clients out in St. Cloud. Yeah. Okay. Then my other piece to it, because the requirement from what I'm looking at in the contract, or not a contract, but the agreement between you and AVAC was that you would be working in St. Cloud due to that pay increase that was instilled for the payroll. Are these two things something that you can be responsible for? Yeah. I guess I do want to kind of clarify just so to avoid any future disappointment, does this mean that he wants me to work in St. Cloud like Monday through Friday, like every single day? Or am I still allowed to keep my repeat clients that I have out here in the cities? My understanding is that the pay increase was contingent to you being in St. Cloud. Like just period. The clients have nothing to do with that, unless you are able to maintain clients within Mora, Minnesota. So Mora or St. Cloud, but no Minneapolis? So Mora, St. Cloud was because of that pay increase that you had asked for. The agreement between you and AVAC was that you would be working in St. Cloud. He's mentioned that he really was looking forward to me working in St. Cloud. He's brought it up a couple of times. Yeah, there's a very high need in St. Cloud. That is why. Your phone cut out. What did you? There's a high need in St. Cloud at this time. Okay. Yeah. I definitely, I just, I can definitely work in St. Cloud. I just want to make sure that I'm so I guess I'm sorry. I just need somebody to tell me, like, am I allowed to like have people like in Minneapolis or keep the clients, some of the client load that I have or just work in St. Cloud? I would state that. All right. If your folks in the city need support from someone in the cities, then coordinate with me to have a secondary peer be the main peer for them. And then the direction that I'm giving you is that we would like you to be working in St. Cloud. Okay. All right. Very forward. Okay. Okay. Thank you. That is very helpful. Sorry. I had to like ask you to repeat that a couple of times. I just needed to make sure that it was clear for me. That's okay. It's okay. I think like questions are always good. Like we're a community. You hear me? So that's just a part of the process. But, okay. Any questions, concerns, comments? So, all right. So I should start. So the clients are in St. Cloud. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So I should start. So the clients that I plan on working with in the, or that I have been working with in Minneapolis, I should work with Miles and some of my other coworkers to start to find secondary or new primaries for them or to transition them to somebody else's care. So that you can be able to support them as may be down the line and then transition to fully being in St. Cloud. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. And then, so, and then will I be able to use Percentive starting Thursday when I do my LADC appointment? Yes. When you're out of your LADC appointment, do not hesitate, call me. I'll reactivate your account right now, or like right then and there. Okay. And then Miles, Miles actually said that until I'm allowed back on Percentive, no hours, like I'm not allowed to clock in. Is that correct? No billable. I'm not able to work with clients. That makes pretty good sense. Yeah, that's correct. Is it okay if I call you? Are you talking to me? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's fine. Okay. All right.",

So that's I'm not like 100% Yeah Yeah, so the full motion the one that's for your TV is 60 bucks. It's like $59.98. So it's like 61 bucks No, not a you can hold a 65 inch up to a 65 Yeah Yeah, the full motion ones that like fit the 75 inch TVs they're like super heavy super like Like reinforced. Yeah, you've seen the one that I used to have where I still got Or Well, I think since the one that you have mounted right now is like It's like a no motion. I think you have one in your bedroom should be like a full motion one, especially because like Yeah, you you kind of need a full motion one And then Cord hider thing Like the one like where I put a hole in the wall or the one where It like you put like this plastic thing and it hides Sounds worse than it actually is I just got it with somebody Okay Yes I Should have grabbed a fucking basket or something Mr. Tire, we already got a mr.

Got to do with the alternator, and when I'm doing the alternator, I'll check to see if he needs to get it replaced. Then, um, he has his back brakes where after getting the alternator done, get it charged with the battery and shit like that, and drive it to a goddamn car wash, and I'll do back brakes there. Where I, he, I, I haven't, I sent him a message saying I had just left, where I, I haven't heard that from him. I'm at the checkout thing, and I'm, I'm not sure which card I'm supposed to use.

So, yeah, sorry. I'm just trying to get at something, and then I got kind of distracted or cut off, but ... So, what do you got down here for tools and, like, what's your level of interest in? Right now, I got the basic wrenches and sockets, I got a couple of heavy mauls, a lot of my electrics were stolen. I have a couple, but most of my electric impacts and all that were taken. My air compressor and all that was stolen. What about, like, scissor jacks or hydraulic jacks? You got that if needed? I got a big jack and I got little jacks for hydraulics. I do have a scissor jack, but I do not use them because I do not trust them. I've had them fail multiple times. Right. And I got a couple of stands. But would it be fair to assume that all of the stuff that you just listed is, like, kind of scattered throughout, like, your garage or something, or your truck or something? No, I put some of it's in my car, or my mom's car, some of it's in my bedroom, and the rest of it is all in the basement on top of a couch. Okay. What are you trying to fix? I fucking off the top of my head. I can't even remember. I think the last thing I heard somebody say was a 2011 Ford Escape or some shit. But I don't try to remember that. I write it all down, so I don't have to, like, think, strain my brain trying to remember all that shit. Was it a starter or alternator or brake? Yeah, I think he said a starter. This is just going off of memory. I could look at my phone. I could pull over and actually look at my phone at the conversation. But this is just one person. I think he said it was a starter and rear brakes. And then I had another guy call me who sounds like he's basically willing to, like, go wherever I tell him. And he's looking for, like, a tune up. But even though he said tune up, like, I guess I got to give him some further questions as to, like, if there is something specific he's trying to fix or if he just wants to pay me for, like, a predefined, like, plugs, wires, whatever, you know, for the tune up. And that guy, I think he has, like, a 2008 or 2011 GMC Yukon XL. Yeah, for something like that, it'll be filters, double check the belt. You want to make sure that the charging system is working properly. Yeah, plugs, wires. Yeah, that part's easy. There's a depends if it's got a coil pack or it's got a. Yeah, that's why I love AI. Well, actually, most of the stuff, like when I'm figuring out estimates, a lot of the times I'll actually just go right on, like, like, Napa, Napa, fucking dot com on their website and they like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, you see, like, like, you punch in, like, what, what you're working on and what you're trying to do and then it gives you, like, an average, like, shop rate and how much parts would be so, like. I go to parts, I'd never go to Napa because Napa always high bucks the hell out of it. Yeah, I wouldn't. I actually don't really favor napa. I just like the tool that they offer on their website. Usually, if I find the tools I try and look for other places where, where I can find it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But I mean, I just kind of wanted to figure out if, um, since I actually just got down, got off the phone with one of my bosses that, you know, I work like my regular job at and they gave me some, like, direction that kind of changes my, my game plan for the week. And my original game plan was to be, like, I was going to stay down here, kind of couch surf, you know, between a couple of different people that I have arrangements with. But now, sounds like I'm not going to be working my regular job. So I have, like, a couple of different people, probably like four or five people that I was going to return their calls and kind of get their information together. So I can kind of share it with you. And, you know, there's between you and there's another guy that I met back in October who kind of does, like, mobile mechanic things like his main source of income. His name is Miguel. He's from around here, too. Pretty cool. But I don't know. Maybe team up somehow and just make some money. Obviously, you don't have to agree to anything. I'm not going to sell you the dream. Anything I share with you, you're totally like, yeah, that's too much or that's too little or whatever. You don't have to do it, but you'll know ahead, before you start what you're going to be doing and how much you're going to get to, like, reduce friction. Right. Starters isn't that's fairly easy. Same with alternators, but water pump, that's a little more difficult. Radiators, those are as long as you drain it properly. It's not bad. Yeah. There's a lot of different parts, but for the most part, they're pretty easy overall because most cars are pretty damn close to the same. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I know that there's especially doing, like, starters and alternators. There's fucking I've had to do those on different vehicles where you need, like, a fucking special tool. But I don't know. I don't think I've ever needed a special tool. I mean, usually. Really? The Audis and the Jettas, I think, are the ones that you need, like, a fucking special tool where it's, like, I don't think you, like, 1,000% need it, but, like, they offer it as a special tool and it's, like, a flat thing. You basically don't have to. Oh, the belt tensioner so you can release the belt. Yeah. Yeah. Usually I just use a ratchet for that, or I got a long breaker bar I'll use for it. As long as you can get it in there. That's the hard part. Yeah. Yeah. I learned the hard way. So I actually just went and bought one of those flat fucking special tools. I did have one, and that disappeared. Yeah. Same with me. And with my truck broke down, I essentially don't have, like, any tools with me at all. I didn't. I got dropped off out here pretty much, you know. Oh, geez. So, yeah. All right. Well, I. Yeah, I'll save your number here. Yeah. I'd recommend maybe putting all your tools together, like, whether it's, like, in the garage or in a. Are you mobile to go places? Or are you only able to go to. I can. I can. I just got to. Right now, I've got to double check my charging system because my battery light came on and said, check charging system. I checked it. It was reading good volts, but the light stayed on like it wasn't charging. And I was like, all right, turn it off. Let's see what happens. Then I watched the voltage just plummet. Yeah. What do you. You know, I probably have to go get another battery. Are you driving the Silverado or something? No, I wish. I miss my Silverado. I miss my Ford. But no, I right now I got a Chevy Impala. Oh, it's not your mom's? No, I bought another one. Oh, OK. Because, yeah, mom's one down. I still have to fix mom's. I got to do the steering system on that one. That's a common problem with the Impalas. Yeah, it was the rack. First, it was the line went out and the line caused the rack to go and the pump to go. So I replaced all the lines, the pump, and then found out the racks are still out. And it's like, OK. And it was the rack went out because it was rubbing on the exhaust. The line was rubbing on the exhaust. The line was rubbing on the exhaust. And it's like, really? Just a slight flex and didn't have that problem. Well, hopefully. Yeah, it's actually really similar issues that I had. But yeah, I mean, you get it running, it's the thing runs like a champ. Well, I'm not too far away. What do you think now? Well, tonight I was planning on just hanging out with Becky at Becky's place. That was the, what did they call that? The nebulizer. Is that your mom? Yeah. Yeah, that was my mom, Rose. Tell her I said hi. Will do. OK, I'll give you a call back when I have more facts and stuff. All right. All right. Talk to you soon. Have a good day.",

Uh, I kind of, were you able to get something figured out to, to the tune up on your truck? Shit, I don't got no tools, so what I'm gonna do if you don't got no tools? Uh, I was just, uh, talking with a couple of guys that I've partnered with in the past and sounds like they're willing to, I don't know, they're open to kind of helping us all out while I'm in the area. So, would you be able to get the tools? Well, what we got to do to get the tools and shit? Damn, I wasn't gonna get off work till 6 o'clock today. But hell, you can have it. So, I just want to, yeah, we, yeah, tools are available, uh, I mean, at two different places or like options as far as, uh. Well, as I was finna say, um, the oxygen sensor too, the one that's on the top, I think that needs to be changed too or at least took out and cleaned. Yeah, yeah, um, we can try to clean it with brake cleaner, I mean, that's the best we can do. Otherwise, those things are, usually when I clean them, I clean them with, like, most of the time. You said what? You breaking up? Yes, sir. You breaking up? Okay, can you hear me better now? Yeah. It's, it's probably better to, uh, if we could try cleaning it? No, I ain't trying to clean it. The, the O2 sensor? Yeah. Uh, yeah, we can try cleaning it. I mean, you're supposed to clean those things with, like, like, supersonic, like, um, I don't know, take them to, take them in to basically get them cleaned. Um, uh, but anyways, was there anything besides, like, uh. So, I could tell you, like, what, what a tune-up usually covers and, uh, kind of text it to you in advance to show you what we've been doing. And, uh, parts. You, are you, is it the 2008 or the, the GMC or the, I can't remember because. Yeah, yeah, 2007 GMC, you, you got the dialing 6.2 engine. Okay. We can go back in. So, the O2 sensor though, and then, uh, on the top one, which is like super, super easy. And then sparks and plugs. Yeah, wires and plugs. And then the oxygen sensor. How much are you going to charge me to put that on? I have to punch some, all that information into my phone, but I obviously it's not going to, not going to try to get rich off you. Try to get done as soon as possible, actually, because I think you're like the third person I got to try to meet with between today and tomorrow. Yeah. Are you going to be able to, uh, would you be okay with driving it someplace or do we got to come to you? Yeah, I could drive it somewhere. I was going to stay to six today, but I get off at three 30. If you can, um, if you can go on and get it done. Um, um, I can't, I'm not actually available until like after five. So I can stay working for a little while. Yeah. Yeah, I think so. All right. All right. I stay working for at least about four 35 o'clock there. All right. I'm probably going to lose you because I'm about to go be pulling into this fucking big ass parking garage. So, uh, how much are you going to charge me to do it? That's what I need to know. I think I'm going to get this shit done. I don't know right off the top of my head. But you want to know how much for the parts and the labor, right? I can get the parts. I can get the parts. I just need to know how much the labor is going to be. Okay. I, uh, I can give you a call. I'll text it to you or both in, uh, like five minutes or less. Okay. All right. All right.",

Trying to kind of figure that what I was going to do the next couple of hours I'll write right now. But. It's awesome. Yeah. You got to talk into the phone or something or take me off of spirit or take me off your Bluetooth or something. Yeah. I can't now it's getting gotten worse. I can't at all. I did. I could hear you really well in the beginning. I even got 34%. Okay. Good. No. I am an uptown. So that might be a part of the problem. Oh, well, I mean, I can hear you now. Good. So I'm trying to like. Let me call me. Call me back. Hold on. I can hear you fine. Well, I can't. I can. Now I can. Where I got. Write a letter to wax County. Telling them that I tried to try at nine o'clock. I started trying to get on zoom. And I didn't get a hold of the sheriff's department until about 10 o'clock. And because the only number I had for the courthouse. Was their old number or whatever. It's like 2024. So I had to call the sheriff's office, the sheriff's office. Directing me to a courthouse. I spoke to the deputy court. Officer or whatever. And she said that I have to write a letter to the judge. And then I'll see what the judge does. But for it taking me an hour to get a hold of the sheriff's department, for them to have to direct me to the courthouse. It's bullshit. The whole thing is bullshit. So I got a warrant for my arrest for that. I'm guessing where that was Friday. I got a warrant for my arrest. And I needed to know what the conclusion was for that thing. This decided. I was supposed to be doing a competency. Assessment. But talking to my lawyer, like. That's not even something that could be because of the head injury. I shouldn't have to fucking do, do any of it. I knew that she was trying to get me to fucking. I don't even have a public center anymore. I don't even have a public center anymore. I got this new fucking public center. But. I don't even have a public center from last because of. I'm not giving me an opportunity to fucking get one. Like I said, I did. I saw a judge. And then on my way to be transported, I was fucking booked. Before I left the building. And I couldn't like, I, it took me. A little over an hour to get. Where I resorted to calling the non-emergency line. So I got to let you know. I don't know what the problem was. We get on zoom. I didn't have any links directing me. I tried to call. The number that was on. And that didn't work. Where I got to write a letter to them now. And then. Request a public center for up there. You need that for my last time. Yeah, for my last car, the one that you missed the. Zoom call that you missed. Yep. Okay. And then. I'm trying to think of what else I got. And I really can't think of everything. At the very second where I just walked into this. Okay. I was looking for. And this is not where they keep the bread. Hey, so tell me the vehicle that needs to be worked on again. Say that again. Whose vehicle needs to be worked on again. Some guy outside of my mom's place. He lives at my mom's apartment. Okay. And then check the surface belt as I'm doing that. And then the back brakes. What kind of vehicle is it? Beamer. Like a 2000 something. Okay. You know, if it was a Jetta or if it's a. BMW. Okay. Over here. And rear brakes for sure. Yeah. That's what he said where I haven't had a chance to look at anything yet. But yeah. Do you have like a way of getting ahold of this guy or do you. Yeah, I got his number. Okay. For the back brakes. The alternator. The alternator on this model of vehicle. You need to get a special tool. You have to get in it in advance. Otherwise it's like. Significant struggle. The. Thing, but it's like a flat. Flat. Flat, like kind of wrench. Extended to like. I don't know, like three or four feet. And then it has like the special. Special. Yeah. Yeah. It's a special tool. You can pick up. It's. Not like. It's doable. Like without it. But. It's. That's like a nightmare. Absolute nightmare. Because you got to actually. Like. Like. As soon as you start looking at it, you're like, oh, do I go from the top? To get this done or do I go from the bottom to get this done? And then you end up like struggling. Either way. It's not a struggle. It's not a struggle. It's not a struggle. Last time I did it, I don't recall having a problem, but it's. It's been a few years since I had to work on Steph's Beamer. You told him a 50 bucks for the alternator. And how much for the rear. Right. 150. Yeah. Right. You said one 50. Yeah. You need to stop it. Okay. Give me two minutes.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hey, how's it going? Doing all right. Yeah, I just wanted to give you a call back. Just kind of, I don't know, share two of the people that I talked with earlier about the different vehicles working on. You want me to text it to you or you just want me to fucking spit it out? Yeah, text it. That'll probably be easiest. That way I've got a record as well so I can go and roughly what and look it up. Okay, all right. I'll just text it to you then. All right. Yeah, I still have my arms and we're watching, uh, was it Tulsa Kings? No. Landman or... Uh, sounds familiar. He's like came out or something, right? Yeah, it's pretty new. Oh, okay. I think this is the second, I think it's the third time I've seen it. We watched a couple episodes a little bit. Pretty good. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll have to look that up. Have you ever seen Tulsa Kings? I don't think so, but it is on Netflix. Um, Tulsa Kings I think is on Paramount. That one's, uh, Sylvester Stallone. That one's, I recommend that one's really good. Um, oh yeah, so basically the two different vehicles I've heard back from yet is, uh, the first one is a 2007 GMC Yukon Denali and he wants an O2 sensor replaced and I told him, so an O2 sensor and a tune-up, which is, you know, plugs, wires, air filter and maybe an oil change. Yeah, and you don't know if you need coil packs or a rotor and the other dude. Well, he, he basically said that if, uh, like we're not, he's getting his own parts. So, which is a little different. Um, I mean, if you did have the coil packs, I probably would. Yeah, that's going to easily 150 more because the coil packs are here and spending, I mean, they're easy to replace, but depending on where they're at, that can be painful. Where's the cap and rotor? These ones just go right over it. The cap and rotor, yeah, yeah. They actually just like pop. The labor time, the standard labor time for like plugging wires. They like say an hour and a half to two hours just for that. And then it's supposed to be like an hour and a half to two hours just for, uh, one or two sensors. You pull it out like this. Depending on where the sensor is or what sensor, otherwise there's multiple sensors. Yeah, I know, I know that there's a, it like splits off into two on the exhaust. So if it's like, I don't know if he wants us to do both of them or like the one that's like really close to the engine. Yeah. With one of those, you're probably going to have to heat the exhaust up in order to get them to go free, but you might not. You might get lucky, but otherwise, yeah, they tend to get stuck in the exhaust pretty good. But if they are able to come free, they work pretty well. It's not too difficult. And a lot of times it's like, uh, you'll see a specialty school, like, uh, it'll be like a depot socket. And, uh, the little, like one of the sections cut out, that's where the wire will go. So as you, you put the, put that on there and then you put the wire outside. The other, you have to go with a, uh, not an open end wrench, but like a closed buck wrench, closed buck wrench or box wrench, which everybody's got them, but it just depends on the angles. That's the hard part. You don't happen to have any of those, uh, uh, those open box wrench for the O2 sensors do you? I got a ton of box wrenches. Oh, uh, oh yeah. And so on the other vehicle, totally, totally different vehicle. Uh, and I don't actually, I don't know if this second vehicle is mobile or if we got to go to him or not, but it's, uh, an 08, uh, BMW 2008 BMW. He needs an alternator and rear brakes. Uh, I'd have to look up a video on that, but it should be fairly easy. Yeah, that's what I double check because I never worked on a BMW before. Would have been the Beamer and the Jetta and the, and the fucking, like, they're the basically all sister vehicles where you need that special tool to get the alternator off. Like the flat thing, flat bar thing for the tensioner. Oh, your pry bar? Yeah. Or a, uh, yeah, or yeah, should the tensioner, that's usually, that's not usually too difficult. Usually that's fairly easy. Yeah, typically, but I've had to do that just before on the side of it. Actually, I was stranded on a hotel and I was like, oh, okay, there it is. And I was like, okay, it's like, should I get it up from the top or should I get it up from the bottom? And then like, as you get going, like you realize that the fucking nightmare to get to fucking do it either way without having that fucking tool. But it's free, the tool is free to rent. All right, I'll make sure to grab my long wrench, my long wrenches, just in case. Those ones are usually pretty helpful in situations like that. Yeah. And I actually didn't meet this person personally. So the person that fucking told him the alternator was $50 for labor, uh, I think is, uh, uh, fucking crazy, but 150. So basically $200, um, altogether for the alternator and the rear brakes on this BMW. And, um, well, the rear brakes, I would probably take roughly half an hour. The alternator that, again, it's going to take about an hour to fix everything. So that's pretty close to shop prices. Yeah. If not a little underrated for the prices, but being going to the shop, they're going to pay a little more. Um, uh, the rear brakes or, uh, disc or drum brakes. Yes. That makes it a little more difficult because you got all the springs and everything, all the hardware that has to come out and then put everything back together. Yeah. I fucking hate doing those. But it's, yeah, I always take a picture that way and make sure, okay, this goes here, this goes here, this goes here. Yep. All right. I don't know if that guy's like mobile or if he can come to us or something, but if he can't, for some reason, then he's that that's located in fucking, uh, Huntington place apartments. You know where that is, right? Uh, I can see the sign and everything in my head. I can't think of where it's at off top of my head. And it's like off of Broadway and, um, Dane right. Basically. Gosh, that's super close. Yeah. And then, uh, the, the Denali guy, uh, he said that he'll come to wherever we're at. I'm just waiting. Denali. That's the same thing as the Chevy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Denali and the Cadillac Escalade though. They're all sister vehicles. Yeah. There's the Cadillac. You need the premium parts. Yeah. Or you might need the premium parts depending on what model, because it may, you may not be able to do regular GM parts or the base parts. Cause it might, uh, might be slightly different than the other models, but we have to make sure on what model and all that, or they do. I should say. Yeah. Yeah. He's getting, he's getting some stuff this time. I would tell you to write, I'd rec, I'd recommend all of them to go to B&E for their parts. Yeah. So they should have almost all of them and they'd be able to get at a better price than, uh, like if you went to Napa or O'Reilly's. Um, yeah, I could tell him that. So I, I'm going to, I already texted both of the guys, the, the total cost and whatever. Total cost and whatever. And like, if we have to take out more than one O2 sensor, it gets a hundred bucks. It's a hundred bucks per O2 sensor. So if we've got to take out more than one, that's an additional a hundred dollars. All right. That's fair. That's reasonable. Um, and I think in both of you, that you got to be able to locate them and what access do they got to home? Yeah. So both of these, uh, Some O2 sensors, you have to loosen the exhaust off the vehicle to be able to get to them. Yeah. And that's the bitch part. Yeah. It's a manifold one. That can be a pain in the ass. Oh, I know. I hate removing headers. Um, so I think that we pretty much like the total cost of whatever their, their final outcome is, is we just split it in the middle. Um, I'm going to be like right there with you, I guess. Yep. Um, okay. Right now I'm in Oak river. Um, you want me to give you a call when I get home? Yeah. Yeah. I'll text you that information. And, uh, I mean, any more information if I get more stuff that pops up. All right. All right. I'll talk to you soon. Talk to you soon.",

    "transcript": "Other calls: Jay-c @ 4m 2s Hello. Hi. Hi. Sorry, I was at subway and I just so happened to run into Sadie there. And it was like, um, like fate or something because I just left her a voicemail earlier that she had not responded to. Um, but no, I got a call from my attorney earlier and she said that my thing, like, I basically won my case and that appeal is going through and stuff and so I should be good on my end. So then I contacted recovering hope and stuff and now I'm trying to figure out like if I can start next semester or what. That's cool. Yeah, on their website. Now what hiring an intern right now. Yeah. But yeah, it was just funny because I literally was like about to, I was planning on getting McDonald's for me and the kids and then I was like, my sister was like, Oh, you give me subway and I was like, I guess. And so I went to subway first and like right when I was waiting for these people I could see inside that they were like you know finishing their sandwiches or whatever and I was like about to leave the kids in there and just run in there. And then I noticed one of them was Sadie and I was like shit and so I had to like take the boys out of the car because I knew I would be like in there longer. And then they were just fucking running around subway crazy. Yeah, Alex is like, he like the first thing he does is run inside and grabs a bag of chips and he like is pointing at me and like shaking in front of me and I'm like yeah you can have that. I'm talking to Sadie. And then once we were like she was, we were done talking and I was ordering. He like grabbed a cup and like went up to the fucking fountain and like started like almost pouring himself a soda and I'm like you don't even know what you're doing. And the guy like didn't stop him and the guy was like uh and I look and I'm like my bad and I was like I'll buy that like. And so I ended up getting my sister a drink and these chips for the boys. And we went and got McDonald's. How was your day? Um, I don't know, kind of busy and overacting like slightly and irritating. What's irritating? Um, I'm going to be down here for the week and work. You know, get my Monday through Friday hours down here. Okay. Is currently not going to work out as smoothly as I had hoped because while I was on leave last month I didn't do my LADC appointment. Um, I'm pretty sure I was told that I didn't have to. But yeah, I'm pretty sure I fucking actually don't because I only need to see the LADC every like 20 hours of meeting with clients and I haven't had 20 hours. But, you know, basically the soonest I could meet with my LADC is Thursday, possibly tomorrow night. If they like cancel. Yeah. But until then, um, I came up with a great idea of calling back some of those people that needed work done. One of them is calling me back right now. Okay, call me back. Alright, bye. Bye. Hello, can you hear me? Yeah, I don't need no oil change or no motherfucking air filter. So what? A hundred dollars. Oh, no. Well, for the tuna, this was spark plugs and wires. Spark plug wire. Where the fuck am I? No, the O2 sensor. It's a hundred bucks. You don't need to do that. No. Yeah, and plugs and wires is 160 then. You put plugs, wires, air filter, and oil change for 160. If I don't need the oil change or the air filter, I have still 160. I mean, it's going to take us like two, possibly two hours to get all that shit out of there. Two and a half hours. To get spark plugs out? It don't take that long to get no spark plugs out. Spark plugs out? Yeah. I mean, yeah, the front ones are easy to get to, but the ones in the back, they're fucking ups a pain. Yeah, so what, 125? 125, hold on. 125 for the, and you don't need to do the O2 sensor though. All right, go do that. I'll wait to do that. All right. You want to do it tonight though? Yeah. Getting high, nigga. Yeah, we ain't wasting no bullets. And on top of that, nigga, I'm not giving nobody a hundred dollars to go to they club for two hours, nigga. I ain't doing that neither, so I'm going to be at somebody's house getting high and bringing in a new year. Man, you'll never believe it. You know, it's actually my birthday today. Huh? It's actually my birthday today. Oh, you got the same birthday as my bitch ass baby mama? It happens, man. It happens. I know, right? Don't be like her. Fucking already hitting you up for money? Nah, that bitch can't come in and ask me for shit. Oh, shit. Yeah, that shit over with. That bitch can't ask me for nothing. Man, that's going to open up like a whole, like 10 minutes of just... So you want to do it for the 125, man? Let me just run it past the guy that's going to be providing all the tools and all that shit. I know that he said that he's about 45 minutes away from his house right now, so... Well, I ain't getting off right now in no ways. I ain't going to get up to five, so... Okay. Now, 1.30 if everything goes smoothly. All right, sounds like a plan. Okay. Sounds good. I'll call you when I get off. All right. All right, bro.",

providing uh his tools and his assistance well in order for me to work on these two different cars nice whose car are you using uh i had his girlfriend what friends or his fucking aunts or something i don't fucking know carlish is going around in fucking minneapolis like some foreign car okay um don't touch that sorry basically what uh yeah yeah basically um work uh i can't yeah i can't uh can't work with any clients until uh like thursday at the at the latest uh because i need to have my ledc appointment before i'll be allowed back on the software are you still gonna be out there for all this week i don't know i'm the only way that that would still happen is if uh the only way that would happen is if i somebody canceled their appointment uh tomorrow night and i'll be able to get uh and to see the the counselor so um but here here's another thing um while having these conversations um um uh one of my conversations i had with uh azac the one of the admins that hired me um i don't know he's like i'm not really quite understanding that uh oh i don't know let me let me start over so this is a guy that hired me right of course it makes sense that um considering that i've never been in this field before i've never you know i have zero work experience in this um uh the starting wage for tip is typically like i think he said like 19 or i don't know whatever the fuck that number was um was different than uh the number that i had seen as advertised you know because when i applied i thought it said like 23 and um and then you know once he said that i was hired uh i seen like my contract come through and it said something different i i brought it up to him and i renegotiated with him and he's like and he was cool about it he's we had like a good civilized conversation where i had to explain to him the reasons why i thought it was necessary that i be handled differently and um you know i basically told him like you know the hour-long commute you know the uh you know basically my family size my you know what my bills are already and like the level of commitment that i would have doing this um and he's like yeah good good i guess i guess we could do that and i just want you to uh make sure that you are helping out in the same cloud like a lot basically he's been all about me going to st cloud a lot because i guess they're the people out there are like ship bags as far as like the people he's hired um so today when i i had that last conversation with uh one of the office ladies over the phone she's like so you had a uh an oral agreement with azac that i in order to um for you to get your pay rate like it was expected that you were going to be working in st cloud and i was like well yeah i i do work in st cloud i still have clients out there that i'm talking to and she's like okay and then she sounded like she was about to get off the phone with me but i was like hold on just so to avoid any like disappointment or miscommunication later like so does that statement mean that like i'm only allowed to work in st cloud and i i'm gonna have to like transition my clients that i have out in minneapolis to like somebody else and she's like what you can work in mora and i was like okay but just to clarify you don't want me working in minneapolis you want me to focus on st cloud and she's like yes and um yeah i don't know i feel like uh kind of irritated with that i guess i don't know mixed emotions because um this guy's kind of making it sound like i'm not holding up my end of the bargain but like it literally says in my contract that i can work anywhere yeah and the fact that i'm like driving an hour i don't know i just don't like the attitude that i was just given a little bit ago and regards to that like i haven't like 23 bucks an hour is like i should be super thankful for it yeah well they paid more than i will yeah i don't know i guess here are my thoughts um like i i'm seeing um um i don't know i'm just sensing that i i don't know i'm sensing that me in this company me and some of the admin people are not going to agree with my feelings that you know this is the lowest paying job i've ever had and i feel like maybe i'm ready to transition to another company that you know offers me 40 hours and you know a pay rate that i can you know take home yeah and i don't want to like i'd like to be able to use my experience here my time here uh as a good thing and not like and um you know on bad terms right i don't know that's what i guess i'm considering is like what my my professional approach to yeah yeah too bad you can't just work at recovering hope work at recovering hope um yeah no i mean i'm as i understand like i am uh they one of my office ladies did actually now oh my gosh why would you do that yeah no are you okay little baby like this little baby like straight up like disarm him and shoved him to the ground you okay you want to go that way okay sorry um yeah there it sounds like there is a even though they're on their website it doesn't say that they're hiring uh cprs's there was like a conversation between huda and uh annie thompson which is one of the ladc's at recovering hope yes i know there was talk of um we're doing uh working there of what um see i don't i don't know i freaking i'm really kind of like she never really gives me like the full like the full fucking conversation or like the full like pieces everything she doesn't she hasn't given me all the information i need to know in order for me to be like okay hey here's an email uh blah blah blah what what is this uh memorem memorandum of understanding going to look like yeah i don't know but i have been told that i should hit up annie i'm just very confused about what they want me to talk to her about i just asked them like hey like my boss said to hit you up i don't know if it's for a position i don't know if it's to fucking merge something like do you have any more information i don't know yeah yeah because yeah i mean that would be cool because then we would both be at recovering hope and like you'd be in the area and like um i don't know typically they have like they have those buses and stuff so like if you were to be taking clients like to appointments or like whatever your job role was like how jess takes them to the meetings and stuff like she just drives the fucking the bus so you don't even need a car but like if you needed a car and like i was at work and we're in the same town like you could just use my car and so we got you a car instead of like having to drive like an hour away with our only vehicle right right it would be pretty cool to uh work back close to home right yeah well and i know that i mean it's just winter time so like you'd probably still eventually want to do your other thing of like roofing or whatever it was right yeah that's not until like march or april right and hopefully like yeah i don't know i'm i was like semi talking to kiana about because like she was talking about or like i said something about taxes and then she's like yeah i mean me and brandon kind of discussed like me claiming the girls since i've worked longer and i was like well and i don't know if like they're going to try to take anything from brandon if he were to claim them so like it would probably just be smart if you claimed them but like work out some sort of like payment arrangement or whatever like um whether that's like paying stuff that you need paid with the money or like her just giving you some money because i mean technically like yeah they live with her now but they were with us the whole last year um yeah yeah um i know like last year i i let i let her claim or actually i don't think she claimed them last year because we didn't have them last year but yeah nobody claimed the girl last year because they were only with us for like three months and you're technically claiming them for the whole previous year or they were only with us for a month at that point when i did my taxes um yeah um but she told you that i she already she already is planning on me allowing her to claim them is that what you were saying yeah something like that but you guys had talked about it or something because like she's worked more this year than you have but i think i mean regardless of who works more i mean because that's like a separate thing i want to say or maybe it is all federal and or the kids are state i don't know i don't know where the funds go per se if it's federal or state but from my experience last year i know if you owe anything to the fucking state or whatever they're gonna fucking take it from you so and you owe the state money i owe federal money or state yeah i was state money yeah so i don't know if the kids being claimed goes on federal or state but just to be safe i would imagine just working something out with her like hey like you got this much money most of that is much money most of that is the kids like working out some kind of a payment plan of some sort well i mean technically you could claim like i mean technically you could claim the kids like so you'd have all five of them yeah i guess but i'm also like then i don't know if you have to be like per se a legal guardian or whatever like because i was a guardian but not legally like you know you guys are their parents yeah like i have i have sole physical custody and i just share legal so i mean what i was gonna say but like we're not like if let's say if we were married you're like the financial provider in the household so i mean that's it would make perfect sense for you to claim the kids it doesn't matter if they're not like biologically yours or there's no but like yeah i guess but i mean i'm not gonna i'm pretty sure that like you you can only like caps out after a certain amount of kids anyways so like there's like a maximum so i think you can only get like three i think you can only claim like a maximum three uh like kids or something like you can claim more but you're only going to get the benefits for like three no matter if you how many kids you have right well like i said i mean we're not you know on that weird like fucking i fuck you over you fuck me over shit i'm sure kiana will claim them and like you know do some like budgeting of like giving us money and i mean i claimed the boys and i worked all last year so like i don't really i don't per se want money for myself i just want money like so that you can get whatever you need completed so like it would it's really just between you and kiana like i don't really need to be involved i i would just get involved huh shut up gabby what i i you don't have to do any of the thinking i will figure it out all right if i'm going to claim the kids then it would

Um, I was actually gonna wasn't sure if you were going to be available or your phone was working or not, but I was going to propose an opportunity if you're interested. Um, I don't, I don't have my truck or any of my tools out here. And, um, feel free to say no to this, but there's a couple of people that I've done work for in the past, like mechanics stuff. And they've been, they've been fucking hitting me up like crazy. And my plan was to be like down in the cities all week this week. And like, you know, do my regular person job, but now I'm kind of improvising a little bit. And wanted to see if you were interested in assisting me and doing some repairs for like, um, I mean, I know that there's two people right now that are like, well, I told him I was gonna meet up with him tonight. But then my buddy who has tools, uh, he wasn't actually able to be make himself available for the tonight. So I figured I'd see what you were up to if you're interested in tonight or tomorrow. Um, uh, so, uh, one guy's got a BMW and a BMW and he needs an alternator and his rear brakes, uh, replaced and, um, and, uh, then the other one is a 2007 GMC, uh, Yukon Denali. Uh, and he, uh, just wants spark plugs and, uh, plugs and wires. And that was it. Yeah. He did want like, uh, to have me do like an old two cents or two, but I told him it was going to be a hundred bucks for every old two cents I replaced. And he was like, fuck that. Right. Yeah. Those are, those are a pain in the ass. Yeah, they can be. Yeah. No, no, it's not. Um, yeah, um, I got, um, Christie's got a court tomorrow. Um, so, um, I, I can, uh, make myself available after that though. It's at eight 30 in the morning. Eight 30 in the morning. So after that, I can be available. Okay. I'll, uh, I'll, uh, yeah, I could try to make that work. So if she has court in the morning, uh, what time do you think you'll be like back from that? Like, like 10 or something, nine or 10 or some shit. 11. Yeah. You just hit me up. It's an Anoka. Oh, I love Anoka. Okay. Yeah. All right. Well, it was good talking to you. You, uh, I hope you're doing well. I miss you. Yeah. I miss you too, dude. I know where you live. But like, yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, well, unless you moved in the last like two weeks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, I've driven past your place a couple of times just because I was in the area. Now, you know, I have another friend that lives out that way, but it was just as creepy. It was just as creepy. Yeah. No, I thought about fucking stopping by, but I was just too chicken. I was like, shit, I haven't talked to these guys and recent enough to like, just fucking come by unannounced. And then I talked to Marina. She's like, hasn't stopped you before. Okay. I guess so. Okay. All right. Well, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Yeah. All right. I'll talk to you soon. Okay. All right. Bye.",

No, not that break. Just a small break. Oh, okay, okay. How's it going so far? Good. I'm tired. Yeah. Tired, but not, if that makes sense. I feel like you deserve to be more tired. Yeah. Mm-hmm. I know. I should really take a rest. Mm-hmm. I don't know. I mean, it's just like different stuff, but normally I can't stay awake if I wanted to, and I feel like I haven't slept very good, like hard. But then, I didn't think I slept really at all last night, but apparently I did because I don't remember you leaving the room at all. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, you little dick ass, little dick in the booty ass motherfucker. These are way too many sex words. I don't know if you know this, but I'm like about to have a medical crisis, a health crisis. Why? Why? What's going on? Because I'm a fucking young teenager in his prime. And you got a dick in the booty? I mean, it is my birthday, I'll fucking, yeah. I guess we'll party, yeah? I guess that sounds a little weird, like the context of it. I should have really put the emphasize that it's going to be your booty. Of course. And I'm already super thankful. I'm just kidding. Did I leave my cigarettes there? I don't know, what do they look like? They're red, in a red case. I mean, I don't see them, but at the same time, I'm not jumping from counter to counter. Yeah, you are, I've been watching. Are you able to talk through that camera? I don't think so. Because I went out into the living room to throw something away or something. And I could see that that camera was super fucking eye-fucking me. And I flicked it off. And I wasn't sure if I could hear you talking through the camera, or if it was the TV. But I don't know, it wasn't really super clear. So... Yeah, I got a fucking Zoom appointment in like a half hour, I think. Okay, I'll let you go back to your thing. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. If I wanted to record it, I gotta use my money. Use money. Yeah, that's why you put in the SD card, remember? Yeah, but I don't need one. I know you don't need one, but it's, like, good to have it because... Oh, backup. Because if the internet goes out, then it stops recording, because it only records stuff to the cloud, or saves it to the cloud. But if you have an SD card in there, even if the internet does go out, it'll still record, because it's being saved on the internal storage, you know? And when you're trying to watch smart people, because if it was me, I'll just fucking cut the Wi-Fi off, and I'd become invisible. But if you have an SD card in there, I can't do that. Oh, I see. See, you're learning stuff every day. Yeah. I'm proud of you. How much is Amazon Prime? Like, 10 or 12 bucks a month. That's not a lot. And you still gotta pay for the fucking... You still gotta pay for movies. For movies? Well, I'm talking about shipping. Yeah, so you get, like, a fucking Netflix sort of subscription, and you get, like, premium shipping, like... Oh, really? Yeah. It does, like, save a bunch. Like, almost everything that you purchase will be, like, I don't know, like $10 less, because of, like, some sort of Amazon Prime shipping scenario. Yeah, Dan said that he's not specifying how much money he has, but he's pretty much already told us that he's gonna take whatever we have, like, when we go out there. You following me? Hold on. Oh, yeah. Just call me on your next break, okay? No, no, no, I'm here. You said what? I talked to Dan, and he said that, like, he hasn't specified how much money he has, but he said that he would basically take whatever we had. Oh, like you want some dope? Yeah, yeah. So I would recommend getting, like, a QP. Okay. Yeah. And then we go on a little road trip. Would it be the same price as VidaFound? Unfortunately for him, yeah, it pretty much is, because I tell him that I pay $900 for my quarter pounds, so that's what I have to pay, but he has to pay me, like, more than that. So it's usually, like, $1,200 or $1,300 that he'll give me in return. Oh. Oh. Okay. So, basically, if you give him that quarter QP, then you'll have the money to pick up the pounds, and that'd be all yours. That is actually, if you, yeah, you'd have to probably actually pay back the QP money, so I don't, or I don't know what you got worked out, but I just figured I'd provide resources and fucking check you out. Yeah. Possibly. Okay, I gotta go. Yeah, I couldn't see how much I have in my bank account, but I don't like spending my money. You what? Oh, dang it. I don't like spending my money, so. You don't like spending your money? I already got my money, but it has to wait. Yeah. I understand what that maneuver, yeah. Not my money sort of thing, yeah. So, yeah, you gonna introduce me to this guy? The guy that I could get the pounds from? Yeah, yeah, I fucking, I don't know why you, yeah, I fucking, every time I brought it up, I said that. Well, I know, I know, but like, let's do it. I know, that's what we're doing. Okay. Then I'm gonna tell my friend I can get him a pound for 18. You should. And tell him that you'll have it every week. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay, okay. See, I believe in you. This is good business. All right, I'll talk to you soon, okay? Don't work too hard. All right, bye. Bye.",

Thanks. We just got back. So, where are these cars? Well, I think that it's kind of a variable because I'm pretty sure that both of them are mobile. I just need to get a hold of them and tell them to go someplace specific relative to the cities, I guess. Okay. They wouldn't want to go out to the Maplewood house? Well, I wouldn't have a way of getting there myself, I guess. Oh, okay. I get you. But the Maplewood house, you probably got the bulkier tools there and everything, I imagine. I got enough in my trunk to work on stuff. Yeah. But if I got to do breaks, we'd probably best bring it over to the Maplewood house. Well, I mean, I can do breaks anywhere, too. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm glad that you answered because my first step of getting this going this afternoon was just getting a hold of you. And then I was going to get a hold of those guys next. So about those two cars, I'll call those guys and I'll give them your address and see if they're cool and if so, when. And then also, there's two other, I think maybe three other people I'm supposed to return their call and I'll basically just kind of get their information, whatever the fuck it is. These are people I've worked with already. Okay. So, yeah. It's kind of cool, though. Otherwise, I mean, I mean, I know one guy for sure. He's got like a 2012, 2011 fucking Chevy Denali or whatever the fuck, GMC, whatever the fuck. Basically, like a sister vehicle of my vehicle, my truck. And he wants an aftermarket backup camera installed. Yeah, and I think I quoted him on that already. But I remember what it was. I think it was like, I don't know, something close to like $300 or $400 or some shit. Does he have an aftermarket deck already? I don't think so. I don't think so. Oh, wait. Actually. Oh, yeah. The monitor, the display is actually a mountable monitor. Okay. Because I think with his model, he does already have a backup camera, but the display is in the rear view camera, and he says he fucking hates it like that. I get you. Yeah. Okay, so I'm going to make a few more phone calls and I'll let you know. I'll get back to you. Okay. Well, I look forward to fucking seeing you, man. I hope I get to kick it with you for a little bit. Yeah, definitely. Regardless, I can come out to you, too, to work on these parts, too. Yeah. Yeah. If you... Yeah. That would probably be optimal because I know that I'm getting closer towards dark time. I need to go on an adventure or a journey. Oh, yeah? So I'm only able to do this until dark, basically. Okay. But luckily, all these things are pretty small, and I kind of doubt that they're both going to want to do it at the same time. But I am willing to bet that they're probably not going to come over until they're done with work, which is like 5 o'clock sort of time. Right on. Yeah. Okay. I'll make those calls, and I'll call you back. Okay. I'll talk to you soon. Bye.",

That's what they did with my mom's property They did Yeah I can't remember 60,000 or over 100,000 behind in taxes Yeah, and some of those were property taxes I think a big portion of that was property taxes but then also when my dad died and she got all of his like pension and life insurance money Like yeah Yeah, she opted to get it like, you know, just cash out Yeah once and so she was supposed to pay a fucking tax on that money and she Was like, oh, I don't know what taxes So great Yeah, what a dumbass Yeah, 30% tax on everything Yeah So, what are you driving then?

So, obviously, I brought that orange thing up. So you want that to be, like, cleaned or whatever? But yeah, yeah, if you could, uh, video call me, I'd like to see what's inside there. But like, I'm very particular, like, I want to keep it outside until it's all clean. Yeah, it's outside right now. Okay, so like, when you do bring it in to, um, kind of seeing how I did it last night, like, when I pull it out, like, if something has a bunch of hair on it, don't even wash it, put it back in the bag and keep it there, which it's typically going to be black something. Where do you keep on getting rubber gloves from somewhere? Where do you keep on getting these little gloves from? What? You got rubber gloves? Yeah, they're in, um, my drawer in one of those drawers in the kitchen. I think in the kitchen drawer that I have the towels in right below the, um, in the middle. Second drawer in the middle. I can, uh, I can call you on, like, a Facebook video call or whatever the fuck, but, um, it looks like there's a, I mean, just peeking at that orange tub, it looks like there's fucking a big ass tarp. It's like a big ass tarp. It's a black bag. Yeah, black bag, but inside the black bag, it's like a blue tarps. I don't know. Oh, really? Oh, they're not closed? I mean, I, there might be clothes inside the tarp. I'm not exactly sure, but I don't think so. I did that. Yeah. Yeah. I see that. Open it up outside. Uh, so I'm going to open this thing up and see what's inside the tarp while it's outside. Of course. Oh yeah. Actually, I was going to ask you, uh, so there's other bags of clothes, like kind of along the wall, but kind of down further. Like, do you want me to do like that black bag that was already out here? And then those two other bags? Yeah. I don't know. I've already went through that stuff. Um, I'm just afraid. I'm just afraid of getting this hair problem again. I don't know how to get past it other than just throw it all away. I mean, donating is a good kind of thing too. Yeah. Oh yeah. No, of course. Donating. All right. Let me shut the phone down and I'll tell you what's inside this tarp. Okay. I did find my pack of cigarettes by the way. No, you wouldn't. They're in my purse. How did I miss that? I can't believe that would be tarp when it was, it felt really heavy. When tarp felt really heavy, I was like, oh my gosh, I can't believe that would be a tarp. I can't believe that would be tarp when it was, it felt really heavy. When tarp felt heavy. Yeah, it's a black bag. It's a, it's a, it's a, and then there's two bags of like regular clothes. So you said you want this to sit outside? Yeah. Sorry, I didn't hear what you said. What did you say? So did you say you want it to sit outside for a couple hours before it goes in the wash? No, no, I didn't say that. Okay. Well, you can wash it right away. Just the only thing I said is if it's, seems like a lot of hair or a lot of lint on there, don't even wash it. Cause I don't want it in with the rest of my stuff. And it's going to be like the black stuff is really what it clings to. And I'm talking that hair that looks like cat hair. It's like, but I mean, there's, they start out small like that. So any white hair. Okay. Thank you so much.",

At Hennepin dot U-S. Dot U-S. Yeah, you can always tell when somebody has some military experience when they're also using the phonetic alphabet. So. Say that again, I'm sorry. You're a veteran? No, I worked at the airport, so we used military. We used the alphabetic. Yeah, yeah, that's usually like a dead giveaway when somebody else is using it, and. I know, yeah, I know. I wish I could say that, right? That's cool though. Yeah. Okay, so it's Antoinette, your first name, dot. It's Antoinette dot Stewart. Antoinette dot Stewart at Hennepin dot U-S. Yes. Okay. Then I should send that over to you. You should have it in just a few minutes. And again, my name is Brandon Gillis. Okay.

    "transcript": "Oh, yeah, yeah, so I talked to two of the guys and one no, actually, I just talked to one guy. I don't know why I said that. But yeah, he said he'd be off work at about three. Yeah, he's, he's pretty much down to, yeah, come out to your place. I just hadn't, I didn't have enough time to confirm the price or what exactly it was that he needed because it's been a while since I talked to him. But yeah, I was gonna say, um, if you want to do it at your place, I don't have a problem with that. But would you be okay with coming and grabbing me from the cities and bringing me back out there? Or what do you think? Yeah, I could potentially do that. What needs to be done on this car? So let's see, I actually this is a I'm pretty sure this is the guy that so he wants a door. So his fucking passenger seat doesn't move like back or something like that. And so I diagnosed it as I have a potential symptom is like a switch. And I like sent him the part number and all that. So he might have that, which is like pretty much right under the seat, whatever. Oh, yes, here, here it is. So I'll just copy this fucking thing and I'll send it to you. Let me know when you see that. I got a backup camera. Your seat control. And as long as that those are the things that he still wants, like there's no like there's no like me going lower on that specific price, because I already like went lower. I would definitely go a little higher on the backup camera. Yeah, that's actually yeah, that's kind of yeah, I mean, I could have charged like it is like fucking eight hundred dollars to do the backup camera. Right at that price, I mean, I don't think we'll even pull up the panels, you know, tuck in the wires. I mean, yeah, yeah, I think like the big thing is, I mean, the wires don't have to look pretty. I mean, like as long as they're not visible, they don't have to look pretty. I mean, I think the big thing is like putting that protector around areas that they like with stuff, you know, like around the corner, you know what I'm talking about? Yeah. And then I figure it wires into the battery and then he probably wants it to turn on when he puts it in reverse, right? Yeah, yeah. So the the wired into a into the fuse box. I'll have to usually they connected to a reverse light, so it turns on whenever the reverse light comes on. So I'll just have to find the reverse light. And yeah, yeah, yeah. So I've done it before, I've wired mine on my car. Yeah, I got I got like the fucking I don't know, I only I paid like 30, basically 30 bucks for for like a digital technician version of like my car, my truck. And it's actually super cool. I can see why people pay like fucking hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month or a year for it or whatever. But I just paid 30 bucks for one VIN number. And and that's I think that might be pretty helpful with some of these sister vehicle things. Maybe you'll see what I'm talking about, but what does it do? It's like a it's like a manual. You know, OK, yeah, that the OBD scanner, the the gear one or whatever the fuck. Yeah. Yeah. That app offers like an online tech technical manual for and I went and purchased it through that app. OK, I know which one you're talking about. Yeah. But yeah, I'm right in fucking like downtown Minneapolis. I think I could probably be ready, I guess, whenever you get here. OK. So you'll be off at three thirty. Yeah. Yeah. OK. And then is he going to come straight from work to the house or. Yeah, I'm going to fly. I sent you another message like, is that an address that I sent you? Is that your address? Is that correct? That's the house we're staying at. I would send them to the other house. I'll send you a. Yeah, I'll do. I'll do very well. Yeah. Oh. Because that's where all my tools are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's a good thing I didn't send it to him quite yet. We got I got power there and everything, so it's all good. All right. I guess last I'll send it, so I'll send this address over to him and I don't really expect him to get back to me until he's like done with work, I guess, but if he did, that'd be cool. Do you need any upper up speed, anything like that? Not that. Yes, I'm not. I do. Somebody. And I partner with is. Oh, yeah. How much for a T-shirt or a ball? I'll ask her. I know she's got like two zips left before she runs out, so I'll ask her quick. OK, if a ball is 60, I'll take a ball. Very good. Well, yeah, I mean, I haven't smoked or done anything in like, I don't know, like two and a half months. So obviously when I smoked, I had basically been like fairly odd, Thomas. I don't know if it makes sense. No, I get you. Yeah. So, yeah, I'm pretty good. It's pretty good. OK, Mark, on navigation channel. Yeah. Either a T-shirt or a ball. And then, yeah, freaking out probably if you're around 230 ish to 40 ish. Oh, that sounds about right. Right. You get to about three and then and then yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, they give room to if something changes or something comes up, then yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah. All right. Yeah, I'll let you know the price on that. All right. All right. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Cool. All right.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hi. How's it going? It's going good. I'm just laying on the couch. So, you're lying on the couch? Yeah. You just got back from running errands. Yeah. Running errands? Running errands. Is that what you said? Yeah, we got a car wash and we picked up a package at mom's old place. I gotcha. Cool. Yeah, sorry, I'm kind of going from one thing to another. I just sent that email to that caseworker and I talked to her. She seemed pretty nice. What? The caseworker for Emma. Right. What about her? The caseworker? Yeah, she seemed pretty nice. I just made sure that I had her email and made sure that she received it. Right. I just kind of wanted to double check with you to make sure that that is still relevant. Yeah, I mean, I'm pretty sure it is. She's still staying at Dina's, to my knowledge at least. Okay. Next subject is, I feel like, I don't know, we've been, there's been like a break in our communication or something. And I think I understand why. And I just wanted to talk to you about the school thing. Right. Yeah, I guess it was because of our lack of correct, properly communicating. You know, it's kind of delayed us a little bit, which is frustrating, of course. I think I just, I think I understand, I guess, like you kind of feel a little bit of pressure that you don't want to like hurt my feelings or me to feel some type of way about it. And, yeah, I mean, I just wanted to let you know that I'm not mad, of course. But, you know, it's not your responsibility to, you know, worry about my feelings. It's my responsibility to worry about yours. To a degree. So, yeah, I guess if mom is is okay with them, and she doesn't mind enrolling you like immediately. Yeah, then she can go ahead and do that. Sounds like Emily from playful healing is like, is going to continue to work with Ellen Ashton. But I think I couldn't really fully understand if you've missed too many sessions that you like you are canceled or something like that or you still have like one more chance I don't really know. Yeah, I think I have like one more. Like one more chance. But otherwise. Yeah, I've missed like four sessions. What are you wanting to do. What do you mean. Probably down here. Okay. Yeah. Are you okay. I just haven't been feeling the greatest today. I have a headache and I've been lightheaded all day. And, yeah, my stomach's been upset all day. Yeah. I'm sorry I hope you feel better. We all just get out. Yeah, hopefully, maybe you'll feel better after you take a long shower or something. Yeah, I think that's what I'm going to do after I eat something, try to eat something. Yeah, actually, that's what I got to do right now is warm up some food and. Yeah, what are you even doing. I'm staying over at a friend's house and basically couch surfing. And what my plan was to, you know, work. You know this whole week. But then on Monday, there was like, I guess kind of a change in plan, because, because I took that administrative leave. I guess they, I was supposed to do like a mandatory appointment. And I didn't do it so I have to, I can't like work with clients until I, you know, complete that appointment, that requirement. As soon as I can, I can do it as possibly tonight, but for sure on Thursday night. I was. Yeah, when I found that out. I was like, Okay, so do I go back tomorrow, or do I like try to make this work somehow. And I figured I'd be resourceful because I had like four different people, five people hit me up within the last week to do car work. Even though I don't have any tools with me at all. I think I'm able to work it out where I'm able to meet with somebody that does have tools and split the money with them. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah, that I'm also looking for, like, I'm going to start applying it at some other places and kind of thinking about leaving this company. Brandon. What, why don't if you have time today why don't you call here and see what's going on with that money. Yeah, I've seen the text thread I could do that. Like, I mean I know you obviously need money but like I could definitely use that money like because that was kind of like the money I'd set aside for like moving in and like getting things for here and like. But now with being being so slow at work like I'm, yeah, I could definitely use. You've been watching the news at all lately about Hennepin County DHS. No. They just uncovered like an extravagant like fraud fraudulent thing with some of the Hennepin County Department, DHS, like administrators people whatever. What was like the Somalis or something. Yeah, some Middle Eastern cat like basically, it sounds like he embezzled like $80 billion or something like that. That's probably why they keep denying your money. So I'm thinking is like, obviously they've got like some fucking holes in their, in their system. It's pretty crazy that it's been this long, I think I might even hit up my attorney and just tell her what's up. Maybe this could fucking spark some additional fucking court. Well yeah because I feel like there has to be something it was court ordered like they don't have a choice that has to be paid. Right. No, we're not going to do that like the judges above you. I think courts, it's okay for the court and the judges to not show up to court and reschedule things and not tell me but when I do it, I go to jail. Right. No, I know I agree it's fucked up. I did see her number or text message whatever I'm gonna hit her up and do all that stuff. Okay. My lunch. Well I just picked up Ashton's gift Eva's is ready, and Ella's will be here in the next day or two like for their big gifts. Okay. And me and Gabby are going to go to five below on Sunday to get some like stocking stuffers and whatever pick out some stuff together. When you guys come down. Okay. All right. Sorry I don't have much longer to talk, but I only have a little bit of time to eat some food before I have to like, go and get dirty. Okay. I'll talk to you soon. Oh, you gotta let me know as soon as you get that fucking insurance card to do. I know okay I'm trying and like it's really starting to piss me off because I like did the application I submitted it I turned in all the proofs like I took pictures of my pay stubs like everything. And then there's like no I can't find my application on the app or like on the portal so then I called yesterday, and then they said some weird shit and they're like okay but we'll transfer you to your caseworker and then I left a message and I've called like three times and I'm still can't get in touch with anyone so I'm trying anything in the mail. No. That means you didn't try gonna. What about if you go to the, your email, and you look for something like, like an automatic reply. No, I didn't but it's like I have something from them but the lady said something about like I already had an open case so they didn't take my application but I don't have an open case because I don't have anything going so I don't understand that's why they were trying to transfer me to someone like my caseworker who could help me. Because when I go to try and apply again it says I can't apply because I already have an application submitted. From like when you were getting food stamps or some shit or cash assistance when you're still in treatment. No, for the insurance the insurance is separate than the food stamps I applied for food stamps also I'm waiting for a call back from that as well but don't do that. I didn't do that I need the food stamps brandon like the girls that you make. What. They're not going to give you any food stamps because the amount of money that you make. That's not true I I submitted all my income and they said I qualify, and that I am expedited approved for expedited benefits. So maybe mom isn't really Bill Gates, no I'm not Bill Gates that's why when you're always like oh you have all the money like I literally don't. I went to Sherbourne County and we applied for benefits and food and whatever. And because I made like, like, 280 or $400 a month from my, my weekend warrior thing. They're like, you're going to get like 100 bucks a month. I don't really remember that. But no, that was also because we only had like what we didn't have any kids we only have like one kid or something on there. So like four people is under the poverty guideline. Yeah, you're going to get me if I can investigate for fraud. Why, obviously I'm already collecting food, food benefits for all the kids. Well, they will I'll just tell them that they just moved in with me so you're not going to be getting anything for fraud. You guys can still have for the boys and then I'll get it for the girls here. I'm staying there to stay and where with me. Yeah. Although I didn't give them an address I just told my caseworker that to what the fuck. That's why I told you to fucking get ahold of me. That made no sense Brandon but I'm not telling them that you're living with me that's crazy because then you're working and you're going to go off your income and I'm not going to get anything. The thing is you shouldn't apply for food stamps because with the amount of food stamps that I get. It takes care of everybody. And it doesn't go because you guys bring food on Sundays and then I have to pay for food every other night of the week. You guys have get all of the food stamps that doesn't help me. I mean well you do get some of the food stamps but anyways, like I said it's easier for me to probably share the card with you. Because, yeah, I mean I forgot I knew having you apply and doing all that shit was going to be a fucking headache. I'm probably like, if they if you can't get ahold of somebody about the medical stuff resubmit new application. Brandon that's what I just said it won't let me submit a new application because it says I already have one processing for the family but you as an as a family not an individual. Correct. Weird. I haven't applied that's why I've been waiting to apply for myself because I knew the kids are moving in with me. And since I made too much money for just myself for insurance I knew that once I had the kids that I would qualify again for insurance for myself and for them. You would have qualified for insurance. Like, under any circumstance. I wouldn't know, Brandon you act like I haven't already gone through this I know what I'm talking about. What do you, what do you say, are you, you're saying they wouldn't give you a county insurance. They said I made too much money I would have to do one where I paid per month and I wasn't trying to do that so I waited a couple months until the kids moved in with me. And now because I'm a caretaker of minors under 18, and my income I qualify for county like Minnesota care or whatever and the girls will as well. So that's what I'm trying to figure it out. I've been calling I've been doing everything I'm supposed to be doing like there's only so much I can do, though. So yes, I'm working on it I'm going to keep calling up and I'll let you know as soon as I have more information, Milo, you will set up your Christmas. Yeah, we're gonna have to circle back to all this because, yeah, we're gonna have to talk a little bit more. But you guys have a nice day. Thank you. I'll say a little prayer for you. Okay.",

Hello? Hi, this is Birdie with Gateway Northeast. I'm giving a call back. Oh, hey, how's it going? I think you spoke with Charlie, our AI assistant. I'm okay, how are you? I'm okay. So, yeah, that kind of caught me off guard talking to that thing. Yeah, it's a little iffy. Who is this? So, my name is Brandon Gillis and I am calling on behalf of Rebecca Aspinmall, who is a resident, and I could actually get her on the phone in a three-way call just to kind of confirm that we're cool to talk, but she was explaining to me that she just moved in to this place and she basically has been working during the hours that staff here has been trying to finish her onboarding and her enrollment and energy and stuff like that. We just had some staff changes and I'm not totally familiar with the situation. I can give you a direct number that Rebecca gave me a call back at so I could answer her specific questions and I could also reach out to my colleagues who are now working at different properties. Okay. I've got a paper and pen. Alrighty, so my direct phone number is 763 233-6152. I had to change pages at the last minute. 763-263 No, 763-233 and then the last four is 6152. Okay. I can actually get her on a three-way call right now if that would be helpful. Sure, no problem. One second. Okay. What's up? Hey, I'm going to add you to a three-way call real quick, okay? Okay. Hurry up. I'm at work. Okay. Is everybody here? Can everybody hear me? Yep. Hello. Hi. How are you, Rebecca? I'm good. How are you? He didn't tell me who this was. Okay. Hi. How are you? Good. Hello. Hi. So what is going on exactly? I'm not sure that I understand. Oh, yeah. Sorry about that. I was going to actually call and leave the message. So just because I work weird hours, I'm here until five and then it's just really hard to get anything done or to be able to sit down with you guys. The other lady, other gal, which I can never remember her name. Taylor? Yeah, Taylor. Yes. She had said that she could sit down with me one day to kind of go over everything because I never really got the official move-in tour and that kind of stuff or what to do. So I don't really know too much, but also I really need help setting up my electric. And so my friend, I was wondering if you guys could explain it to my friend that's there and he is going to help me set it up. We already set up your electric for you. Okay. We send a message directly to Xcel Energy and then they would start the billing. Right. But is there some sort of app or something? I'm just not really good with apps and all that. So that's where my friend kind of comes in. Sure. Is there like an app that goes with that? Yeah. So we use Xcel Energy. So once you get your first statement, you'll have your account number and you'll be able to go online and manage your payments directly online. And I do think they have an app. I don't use it, but I believe they do have an app. Oh, okay. Yeah. See, I must not have gotten my first bill yet then. Yeah. Which is weird. Sometimes it does take a minute. Okay. Yeah. You moved in in October though or was it November? It was November. Early November. So you might be getting one very soon here. Okay. Good. All right. Yeah. Because it was November 10th, maybe 7th or 10th. Yeah. Somewhere around there. November 7th I see is your lease date. So that would have been the date that we would have requested of Xcel to start the service. So you should be good to go there. I'll check your file and make sure that we have that confirmation in place, but I just paid last month's bills for our vacant units and yours wasn't on the list. So that does tell me that it is at least not in Gateway Northeast's name currently. Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to cut you off. I was just going to say so that I could double check. Sometimes I think we get in the confirmation email, we get an account number, which I would be more than happy to share with you. And then I can also send you a link to the Xcel Energy website if you'd like. And then I would love to schedule a time to do an orientation with you. I just need a little bit of an advance notice. And then also I am going to be out of the office on holiday until after Christmas starting Thursday. It might not be until just after Christmas, but I will be in the office on the 26th and then every day except for New Year's Day the following week. Okay. Yeah, see I get off so late. It didn't add up with any of the other two's hours. So I don't know what your hours are. Yeah, I mean as long as we arrange it in advance, I'd be more than happy to adjust my hours for you is what I'm saying. Okay. So if we need an appointment I'd be happy to. That would be great. I have bowling on Thursdays. That's my only thing. That would be the only day that I couldn't stay a little late for you. Yeah, that would be great. So after the holidays, you're thinking? Yeah, so when after the holidays I'm available. I'm pretty much open any day. I wouldn't make time for it any day after five. Yeah, Monday at like 530. Yeah, that'd be perfect. Get it done with the beginning of the week. Monday the 29th. Yeah, that'll work. I'll send a calendar invite to you. Is there any other questions that I can answer while you've got me? Yeah, in the bathroom is there supposed to be like a fan that's running at all or how does that thing work? The exhaust should just be running at all times. Okay, because it's not. Yeah, if there was like a fan or something you know that to get all like the moisture out or you know take a shower. I'll just make a note that I'll make a work order that the bath exhaust isn't working. Would they be able to maintenance come when they're able to get to it? Yeah, absolutely. I mean if it's Yeah, absolutely. I mean if they could give me 24 hours heads up would be awesome. But if I'm completely open to them going in without me there. Yeah, I think the soonest it would be would be this week Thursday. That's their assigned maintenance day at the property. They're here on Mondays and Thursdays. So it would either be this coming Thursday or the following Monday. Perfect. Yeah, that would be great. And is there anything well, I guess they'll go over that with when we do the orientation, but my friend that I was on the phone with said that I might that door lock thing might be able to be remote. Is that a thing an auto lock? Yeah, are you guys able to turn the adjust the settings on her on her door so that it auto locks like after 30 seconds. No. Yeah, that would lock me out because I forget my keys all the time. But that would be cool if there was like an app or something where you can lock it from your smart, but they're not that smart. Everything has an app these days. It sure does. Except for our lock. Anything else? No, that is it. I believe we're going to put an appointment on my calendar for 530. I'm going to check your resident file and see what I have on record for your electricity account. And then I'll enter a work order for that exhaust fan for your bathroom. Okay. Thank you so much. Appreciate that. You're welcome. And then I've also going to email you my direct email. So you don't have to talk to our AI assistant in the future because it can be a little confusing. Thank you. Appreciate that. Yeah, you're welcome. Well, let me know in the meantime if there's anything else. Otherwise, we'll be in touch. Okay. Have a great day. Thanks, Birdie. You too. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye-bye.",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? What's up, Brandon? Oh, not too much. Just kind of being productive and yeah. How are you? How are things going with you? Oh, it's going. I've had a couple little run-ins but I'm alright. Uh my headlight went out. I ended up putting that in myself. Yeah, on the passenger side but uh I'm gonna have to uh I gotta take this up to Valvoline Friday and uh get an oil change and uh I should have did it before it got caught. I just didn't have the money, right? Mm hmm. But uh I was wondering how much would you charge me to do uh my uh you remember I told you about the portable GPS I got with the backup camera. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, how much you would you charge me to uh hook that up for me? Okay, I remember I put it in. So, 1 second. So, for the wired backup camera, uh that's two to 3 hours maximum uh time that two to 3 hours it would take maximum and it's $170 labor and um yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's it's actually pretty pretty good cuz I'm considering like all the the wiring stuff that we put on there and yeah. But you would do it right, right? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, it would be it's it's done correctly. It's done like the way like that standard. Yeah. Well, II need a couple of weeks here and then I'm gonna give you a call cuz I definitely don't need that. The seat on the other hand, the part alone costs like 140. That's gonna take me a minute. Um I thought that the the part that you needed was uh only uh sixty uh 72 bucks. Oh, I thought it was 140. For the last power seat switch. Yeah. Yeah, it says seventy-two unless um unless there's a wrong part or something different part, but I'm pretty sure that's the one. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna do the uh yeah, I need that camera set up. Yeah. Yeah. How much do they charge you to do the oil change at Valvoline? How much do they charge you to do the the oil change up uh on Friday? I don't even know II think I've seen a price check. I think it was fifty some something like that. Yeah. The change of oil. Uh I'm gonna give him a call. So I'm gonna show him as high as 100 and some. Yeah, usually they charge pretty **** high. Um we could do it. Um if you just buy the the oil and the filter, if you get it from Napa, you get the filter for free but the oil is like thirty-five bucks and uh yeah, that can that'll give you some relief. You say what now? Instead of paying them uh uh Valvoline 100 bucks and we could just do it for you tonight and all you just got all you gotta do is pick up the oil in the in the filter from the Napa. Yeah, I don't get paid till Friday though. Oh, that's right. You said that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Alright. Well, you got the address that you're not you're not a very good texter. Huh? Well, all this stuff is new to me, man. I've 20 years, man. So, yeah. I'd rather just talk to people myself. I totally feel you. I I I kinda got that idea. The text message I was sending weren't really doing it for you. So, yeah, yeah, no problem but yeah, um I I'm actually gonna be in town uh all week. I I usually live out of town but because I'm having some car troubles myself. Uh I'm actually just staying uh like, you know, local and we're working with some other people that are in the area. So, um on Friday, um yeah, assuming you get off work about the same time, 330. Uh I get out around three, three thirty. Depends on how much work we have to do. Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you can, if you work it out, um yeah, uh I'll I'll send you that address to you uh another time just so you know what it what it is um but on Friday, if you wanna give me a call sometime before you're off of work just to make sure like there's a spot for you and then come up there where you can do the yeah the the the backup camera, the oil change, and uh and uh I mean, actually so I'm now that I'm thinking about it, if it's like Friday and I can, I can probably find either myself or somebody else go and get that part, that replacement part, like for my um I used part part and that way it'd be basically, I don't know, I don't even know how much they would send, sell it for, maybe like twenty or thirty bucks. Mm hmm. Cuz if it works, it works and if um yeah, it gets you out of having to spend seventy-five bucks. Well, like I said, give me a couple of weeks and uh I'm definitely gonna, I definitely want you to do this stuff for me. It's just, I got to be able to uh sort the money and pay the rest of these bills too. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I missed your call a couple weeks ago. **** I was not in a good spot. My that my truck went out. Yeah, I called uh my daughter's car problem. Uh the battery went bad, right? Oh, I was trying to find her another battery. Yeah, you end up getting her sorted out, getting her. Yeah, she ended up getting the battery and stuff. So, that's all her problem. Yeah, that's good. I didn't want her to be without a car in the winter. Yeah, of course. And then we had that freezing biting cold. So, that definitely one of the good things to have your car not run. Yeah, I know. Yeah, my my transmission went out on my truck and uh I've I've replaced it with uh what I thought was a good transmission and turns out it was not. I I was lied to whoever who I bought that from. Why? And uh so I had to go buy a second transmission and put that one in and what what happened with that? Uh no, actually, it was just the one transmission I put in. It was bad. Well, when I get on the other side of maintenance of this vehicle, I'm going to have to do some other things for me. Uh you know, I want some cognitive stuff done. I want to uh automatic cue start. I mean uh car start. I want a car alarm put in there. Okay. You don't already have it. Huh? It already has it, doesn't it? No. You're so you don't have it. So, you got a key fob though. Huh? You got you got a key fob though, right? Like uh oh yeah, I got a key fob. Because um I mean if you if you maybe you're right but like I myself, I actually didn't even know how to use my my my auto start remote start until somebody else like showed me and even uh but uh it's like uh I'll I'll look it up real quick and maybe I'm wrong and you don't have it but uh you gotta keep in mind this is 2012. So, Chevy or GMC? No, it's the GMC 2012. Uh Yukon XL. Okay. Press the lock button on your key fob then immediately press and hold the circular arrow button for two to 4 seconds until the lights flash and the engine starts. Oh, it actually do have one? Yeah. I'll I'll I'll **** I'll copy and paste this thing and and you're going to have to look at the text message. But I believe in you. I think you can do it. I think you can do it. Hey, so you're saying that this is was that the auto start or is it? Remote start. So, you can start it from inside the house, right? Yeah. Yeah. It'll it'll stay running for like 10 minutes and then it'll like shut off. Okay. I didn't even know that. Yeah. I really didn't know that. And that's what you were asking about, right? Yeah because I was going to, I was going to put the automatic start in there and then I was going to put the uh the car alarm in there. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Car alarms are. What's your name again? My name. You done working? No. That's yours. No, I said, are you done working? Is this yours? Oh, you just show out in front of company, huh? I see what you're doing. I see what you're doing. Go ahead. Yeah, I was looking at this uh this avalanche, man. I like it. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I got a thing for cars, man. It's uh I I I get sick with it. You and you like the avalanche? I mean, I like the avalanche because it like looks a lot like uh you know, my truck but II **** I love the extra passenger room and all that. I mean, to me, that's just super luxurious. I love it. Yeah, I like a little little you gotta like a little like a little short body bed in the back. Mm hmm. Yeah, I I like this. I like this. Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah, I like this. He purr like a kitten too. Uh huh. He purring like he want me to drive it. That's it's purring like he want me to drive it. Yeah, it's really doing it. See but but since you got Packers on the car, I ain't gonna probably gonna be able to do it. I'm gonna have to pay it. So, Alright, man. Take it easy. Uh yeah. Yeah. See, once I get that, see, the the thing of it is is that the backup camera I got is in my my my rear view mirror, right? Mm hmm. And it seemed like I got a whole lot of room I really don't have, right? Yeah. That's how it shows, right? Right. And uh I can be up on the bumper and then it still tell me I got all this space, right? So, I got the portable one and I was gonna mount that next to the original one and it should be able to give me the right vision. You know, I was actually just talking to my buddy about about your um about your truck. Uh huh. And um I was gonna, he actually asked a good question. Um on your radio unit, your your radio unit's the one that's got like uh a small screen. Like, it doesn't even really have a big screen, right? We don't even have a screen. Yeah, we got a small screen. This is, you know, for the radio and all that. Yeah, yeah. But it's not like a like a four inch display or some **** No. Yeah, he mentioned and I don't know if this is, I mean, it seems like this should be like a possible but he mentioned that you should just switch out the the radio unit with the the model that's like got the bigger face for the display and that way you use that like you basically just switch for the camera to from like the rear view to the and he mentioned that being a thing and um I that I hadn't thought of before um but yeah, I mean, cuz uh you know, with my my backup cameras like in my like when I see it in my radio, not in my room. Yeah, see, the portable one I got, it's got a screen on it, right? So, and it's it should be a easy fix, right? I just don't know how to do it. Yeah. That's the that's the that's the thing. I got all the parts for it but I I just don't know how to do it. Yeah. And I really don't wanna uh tamper with something and and and it's electrical and then knock out a whole bunch of **** Right. Yeah, it's better to have somebody else do it. That's yeah and I yeah, I know what you mean. Some of those things. It's like when you got the money, it's better to just pay somebody else that's you know, so you don't have to worry about breaking something. Right and then it once if it's done right, then I'm alright. See what I'm saying? You know, a lot of guys have had these uh Tesla screens put in their car and they're knocked out all kind of **** You know, they didn't took like Tesla screen and put it in a Chevy, right? Right. And and they done had all kind of problems. You know, I had actually got the uh portable for my car, right? Uh huh. I just don't know how to put it in. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That does look nice. Um yeah, I was looking at the cost of that other people charge to put the something like that in. Uh huh. Like people charge like minimum like 400, 400 to $800. That's like pretty much the going rate like and it's not that it's like super difficult. It's like just a lot of uh kind of tedious like you gotta really be uh careful about where the wires are going and how they're sitting and yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, that's the that's the important part. Okay. Well, like I said, in a couple of weeks, I'm gonna give you a call and then we'll work from there. Yeah. Uh yeah. I'm I'm I'm patient. I'm yeah and I'm also pretty resourceful. I don't know if you have um any side gigs. Maybe I can I don't I don't like smoke weed or anything like that but I know people around me do. I don't know if that is something. I don't know. I don't do. I don't do nothing. I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't do that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't I don't I don't smoke or really drink either actually but yeah, some of those things I guess but whenever whenever the time does come uh I'll be ready for you but if you know anybody else uh yeah just give me a call. Are you gonna? I think uh JC might be coming out to that place tonight. Are you gonna be with him? No. No. JC. Let me and JC uh we work different jobs now. He's still at second chance. I I I got a different job now. Yeah. Yeah. What's that? What do you switch into doing? What are you doing now? Yeah. I work for uh a paper production company. Okay. Is that over by seventeenth or something? Seventeenth. No, it's out in Fridley. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. It's like some sort of recycling thing. No, actually, they uh cut and put uh paper and ship it. Internationally at that uh locally, internationally to different other companies. So, they basically cut the paper and put it on skids and they and then I guess they sell it to different companies. Yeah. Yeah. I think I'm without looking it up on my phone. I'm pretty sure I know which building you're talking about but I have to pull up the GPS but I I've had to meet a couple people there for my like actual work. I know a couple of kinda younger guys that work there. Okay. But you like it? Yeah. It pays more. Yeah. I never I should never be mad at being paid more. Yeah. Is it is it like actual? I mean, you don't actually have to tell me what the dollar amount is but is it actually **** good? Well, it's more than what I was being paid. You know, and uh it pays every week. So, that's a good thing. More than twenty-eight? No, no. Okay. Oh, hey, look, I gotta call you back. My wife on the other hand. Sounds good. I'll talk to you later. Alright, appreciate you. Yeah, bye. Alright, bye-bye. That didn't work.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Can you hear me? Yeah. Can you hear us? Yeah. How's it going? Fine. How's it going? I'm just about to, I'm just getting a drink and I'm going to be heading out the door in a few minutes here. How was your day? Where is it? I don't even fucking know. Maybe Johnny's old place. I don't know. But I'm going to be doing stuff. Okay. I might be, I might, I might come back like, I don't know, tonight or something. I'm not sure. You might come back tonight? Most likely tomorrow. Fine. I just picked these guys up not too long ago. We're sitting at the car wash waiting to get a car wash. And then I have to run to the fucking, whatchamacallits, the family services or whatever to pay my, my monies. Um, I think whatever you were talking about earlier, cause I called to see about Alex's services at the county because we got a letter saying that it was like not denied, but like, because we never followed up on it, like that they like closed the case or whatever. And so I had to like ask to reopen it or whatever I had to do. And, um, Alex, calm down. So that's probably what that email was about. I was talking to the lady and she's, I don't know, something. And so I'm also waiting on the Rosenberg center to send us the stuff so I can send it to everyone. And my teacher or the lady, she seemed pretty confident that I'll probably get a B on it. And then my grade will be like a B like for the math class. So now I just got to finish this fricking paper that I'm writing right now. That was due on Sunday, but since I've never turned in a paper late, I can still turn this in by tonight and get full credit. And then I have to respond to two other people's things tonight. And then I'm done with school. Huh? What do you mean? It was hard. I don't think it was hard. You didn't do it. And then I went to Walmart after school and I went and got diapers and some more diapers for daycare and some paper wrapping paper and stickers. I bought a bunch of gifts last night and I got a few like, I got some stocking stuffers, but I only got stockings for the boys because I don't know, I need to go to school. I need to go somewhere else to find some good ones for the girls because Walmart didn't have like a very good selection for the girls. You want to know what I got Kiana for Christmas? I don't know, what like promise rings or something? No, I got her a vacuum. And a candle. This candle that I saw it was like light when it's or something about like mom's last nerve. And it's like, Oh, wow, look, this candle is low. Yeah. Yeah, but I got her a cute little small like not small but like one of the like skinnier vacuums and it's pink, white and pink. And that's supposed to be coming I think tomorrow or Thursday. And then one of your guests is supposed to be here before Christmas but your other gift isn't going to be here so like the 29th so Yeah, you're only getting two gifts for me because they're expensive gifts. One of them I didn't have to spend any money though because but I used all my fucking points at work. Because at work we get like, basically like it's like, it's like so that they don't have to give us like cash bonuses but basically you could buy stuff for free. And I had like 22,000 points which is like 200 points really because I think 1000 points is like $10. Yeah. And so I got you something for like 20 20,000 points. Cool. Yeah. But yeah, I think on Sunday, Kiana said that we'll go to like go shopping really quick and get some like stocking stuffers and like the last bits and ends of the kids gifts and stuff. And then I think we should be good. And I still I need I got my brother a gift. I got Ricky a gift. I got my mom something and my sister something but like I need to get them like a few more things because like what I got them wasn't like big or anything. And so I just got him I like looked up like canoeing essentials. Can you hear me? Yeah. Oh, that's good. Yeah. Oh, I looked up canoeing essentials. And like basically it was like one of these like pads for your butt or something to sit on while you're in the canoe. And then a bag. And I was like, Oh, that's cool. I didn't know what to get Ricky. And so I just got him I like looked up like canoeing essentials. Can you hear me? Yeah. Oh, I looked up canoeing essentials. And like basically it was like one of these like pads for your butt or something to sit on while you're in the canoe. And then a bag that's like a waterproof and like it's buoyant. So like if it were to fall in the water, your stuff would be okay and float. Hopefully he likes that. But yeah, that's what I got him. And then I got my brother just like a running tracksuit and a beanie that has like a light on it. And also is like headphones. Yeah. Yeah. My sister asked her what she wanted. And she goes money. And I was like, Well, I'm not gonna give you money. And I was like, anything. And she's like, Well, I wanted $300 to do micro needling. And I was like, girl, what? I'm like, I'm not mom. Not spending $300 on your gift. Yeah. And then she just said, like, clothes or skin stuff. I don't even know. But I don't know. I'll try to find something. I've got to make like, two more phone calls before Johnny gets here. So hold on a second. All right. Well, don't be too fucking weird when you get back. Your face already looks weird. Okay. Nice to see you and talk to you too. Well, don't get offended at me. Like, you know, you shouldn't be doing drugs. Okay. All right. Bye. Be safe. Make good choices. Don't go to jail. Say bye. Alex, say bye. Alex is pissed. He doesn't want to go in this car wash. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Bye. Bye.",

Is there like a special place where you keep all your unused hangers, or are they all being used? My unused hangers? Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah, no, they're probably all being used. Dang, I can't believe I used all them hangers. There's so many of them. I'm gonna have to get more. Yeah. That's right. I almost bought some more at Costco the other day. I wish I would have. You never have enough hangers. That's right. I know that's right. Well, I'm... Shoot. Because I ran out of hangers, unfortunately, so the clothes that your original clothes that were in the dryer that came out, they're like... I was only able to hang up two of them, and the rest of them I put I kind of stacked them flat. I don't know. I don't know the best way. I didn't actually fold them. I don't really know. But in this next load, you'll see what the hell I'm talking about. This next load of what do you call that? Ambiguous clothes? You know, like the bags that... Mm-hmm. That first load just came out the dryer, and... How did it look? Was there a lot of hair on them? Did you see any? No, they actually looked like whoever had put them in the bag folded them, and they were all clean, super well, nice. Oh, yeah. Everything is super clean, but it's just like those... Yeah, the hairs. I lint-rolled front and back, inside and out, and fucking put them back in the bag. But I don't know. You might not be keen to see in those white hairs. Yeah, I didn't have like a blacklight. Yeah, I didn't have like a blacklight or any like forensic equipment or anything like that. Right. Well, I just ordered some off Timu, so we'll see. Oh, really? Dude, if you buy a fucking microscope, dude, that'll be legit, dude. Then we can fucking get down to the bottom of this detective UI in me. I know, that's what I want. I mean, I got that ear microscope. It might work. It's an ear camera. That's not like a fucking microscope. Microscopes, they like... They look at... Well, I know, but it does make it nicer, I would think. You're adorable. I love you. Yeah, well, I mean, I could see things way up close in my ear. Yeah, I'm not saying you can't. I might be brave enough to take a gander in my ear tonight. Who knows? Your idea of a scary movie is so weird. Like, why not? Why not? Saw 5, you know, they go to roller coasters or some shit, or maybe they go cow tipping, and you're like, you want to go stare in the mirror? Yeah. What's the plan? I was just kind of waiting to hear from you. Johnny said he was going to send me that money, but he also said that he was leaving here early, so I think he's on his way. I told him not to come here until 5. Yeah, that's all I got for now. I'm just kind of standing around here, almost all naked except for my socks. Nice. No, I'm not actually, really. I should have, but I thought about it. I was like, man, what would this chick do if she, like, came home and I'm, like, you're painting, and I don't, like, have any clothes on. It probably wouldn't invite me back. Yeah. How was work? It was good. It was good. It was a little slow. It was pretty slow, so I ended up ordering a bunch of shit on Vine, which I should have done, but T-Lo suckered me in. They got big, suckered me in. Talking about I got a $100 coupon to spend and this and that, and I don't think I even got any coupons. So I don't really know what I did. Yeah. That's funny. We'll see. I shouldn't be spending this kind of money, but. You remind me of, like, the old sweet lady that gets, like, scammed by every, like, phone scam caller and, like, is so darn cute, though. Oh, thank you. All right. Hurry back so you can take your medicine. Yeah, what medicine is that? You know exactly what I'm talking about. Sorry, I'm just kidding. That's the aggression coming out again. Sorry. It's totally natural. No, your actual medicine. I didn't actually think you took it this morning, but then again, I'm, like, I'm not her mom, so. I did take my medicine. It's in my car, remember? You were talking about the vitamins, but what about the prescriptions? Yeah, I got the I got a prescription in my car. What, you only take, like, some of them out of the bottle? What? What, do you, like, only take some of them out of the bottle or something? Because the bottles are on the fridge. No, I have my previous prescription I still have. I still have a lot of it in my other bottle. Well, let me call you back, or I'll see you in a second. All right, sounds good. All right, bye.",

I thought you were going to be in the cities for a little bit. Yeah, it was kind of the plan, but things were getting kind of hectic and I wasn't making as much money as I needed to. So yeah, I miss my family. I wanted to go back. Okay, for sure, for sure. So I'll make a deal with you.

Yeah, we'll be back tomorrow or tomorrow most likely. I don't know. Whatever is kind of the best game plan for making money. How are you getting up north? Basically, I try again and then Gabby's coming. No, your mom's bringing me to 65 and 22 and then I'm getting picked up from there. Okay. Yeah. But can I call you after I'm talking to your mom? Yes, as soon as you tell me where my light bulbs are. The closet on the shelf that's next to the door. The front door, you know? The colored light bulbs? No, because, well, there is actually like one, no, all the colored light bulbs is either in some place. The only colored one is like, that's not in some places on that little fucking mirror table thing in the living room. Oh. All the other light bulbs that are in boxes are all like regular light bulbs. Yes, I thought. But then, like, all my light bulbs were moved around. So, there's one lamp that only had one light bulb in it. Yeah. Which had two or three colored ones in it. And then my bathroom one has the one in there. No, all the ones in the bathroom are Wi-Fi ones. They're all are? Yeah, you told me to put it all like that. Well, how come they're all not changing? You just gotta re-sync them to the app. And actually, I would recommend taking them out of those fucking specific outlets and putting them in someplace else if you're gonna re-try to re-sync them. Because I was having a hard time getting them to fucking connect at all. And the only reason I got the one right away was because I took it out and put it in someplace else. But, yeah, it's kind of a headache to learn. If you don't know how those light bulbs work, then it's a little bit of a fucking stressful thing to kind of learn. Yeah, I know how to pair and all that. I just didn't have the box for the other ones to do it. And so, yeah. Okay, yeah, let me know if you need any help. Okay. All right, I'll talk to you soon. All right, bye. All right, bye.",

And I was making a joke because you said I'm at Max's bar. And I was like, oh, damn, you should have said something. I wouldn't have brought a kid with me if you were at a bar. Would not have? Yeah, I would not have brought him with me. Oh, okay. That's the opposite. No. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you. I got you.

So I was like, yeah, let's just throw you in the car and now he's sleeping. I'm regretting wearing company clothes on my way out, because I feel like, when I'm wearing it, I look like a homeless person. Yeah? Yeah. Well, I mean, it's just Tuesday. It's not like it's packed there. Yeah. Um, I am just passing Cambridge. I'm passing that quick trip. Oh, man. So, like, another 15, 20 minutes. Damn. I think. In that case, I don't think I have a choice. I think I have to go in there and sit down. Oh, you were just, like, outside? Do you have your stuff with you? Yeah. Well, I mean, it's just sitting. Yeah. I wasn't really sure how far away you were. Yeah. I was finishing up my paper and writing two responses. So now I'm done praying that fucking it doesn't have too much AI. 25 minutes. Is that what the Google says? Yeah, you're 25 minutes away. Yeah. Motherfucker. What? I don't know. I just don't really. I don't know. I don't think I really want to drink, but. Are you there by yourself? Yeah. Oh, who dropped you off? You think. You're not going to bring people back home? What? No. You obviously got there somehow. So I figured whoever drove you was with you. Yeah. Phoenix. Oh, damn it. I wanted to see her baby. Okay. I do have my wallet. Okay. Okay. Huh? Yeah, I got all my stuff. Okay. I was going to say, I mean, I wouldn't want to, but. If it means seeing that baby, I would go back to her place. Yeah. I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'm not sure if I'm going to. I'm not sure if I'm going to have time for the baby. And. Yeah, it's like wherever. It's not like. Where they're at. Like her uncles. Yeah. That way you had to leave so early. Oh, no. I mean, Honestly, if I. I don't know if I was going to be down there if I wasn't going to be. Yeah. Right. Not what I wanted to do. Right. All right. I wonder what I should do with my bag. Yeah, I think it's fine. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. What if someone steals it? He's going to steal my shit in the parking. Yeah, they would. I suppose. It's a bar. People are drunk and they're like, oh, a free bag. Cool. Hold on a second. I don't know, but I. You're supposed to be getting it back right away, but I guess I'm not getting it back until tomorrow. And you can blame that on Johnny. You borrowed money to Johnny. What do you mean? Yeah. Johnny's Johnny's paying me back. Yeah. I don't really want to overcomplicate it. Yeah. It's not your money to under complicate it. What? I said, it's not your money to under complicate it. I mean, what is money anyways? Isn't there? Aren't they just like federal notes or something or IOUs, but I don't like a federal scale. I suppose. I mean, right now, the way I'm spending it, it is. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Alice awake. No, he's asleep. I thought you were like kind of coming down towards the cities earlier. I don't know. I think I looked somewhere. No, when you called me and video called me earlier today, you were driving. I thought you were said you were in Cambridge or something. No, I just picked up the boys. I was that quick trip, but I did go to Cambridge earlier to take my test. Oh, for school. And it's a last thing for school. You got to do for a while. Yeah, kind of. I mean, I next semester. I mean, I'm going to do my practicum and a statistics class, but statistics is also online. So, I mean, unless I need to take exams in person again, like it's going to be like the math class I just took, but statistics. Like mostly online test in person. Yeah. Yeah. Hopefully I can get my practicum going and stuff. Which consists, you just basically need to get hired and start putting an hour someplace. I already got hired at recovering. So, so then technically you already have started aside from putting in hours. Yeah, I guess I just, I wasn't like they said. So basically the way that it went was I went to court for my thing. I went to my interview. For like, I went to court, I got that submitted, whatever. I did my interview with recovering hope and I had to let them know, like, I have to wait for that to clear itself. And they're like, okay, cool. And then they emailed me like, Hey, we would love to have you. Like basically you're hired, but like what, so what's going on with your court thing. And then like, I was like, you know, like, I might have to, like, I would like to start like as soon as possible if you guys have openings, but like, if that's not the case, then I guess I'll start in the summer. And then I was starting to like make plans to do it for the summer. But then my attorney called me and said that I could, that I got that shit all turned around. So then I talked to them and was like, Hey, like, can I start it sooner? Like I got that stuff cleared up. And so I'm in that middle process where they're like, they said like, Oh, that's cool. Okay. Like we'll work on that. And, but they haven't confirmed like, yes, you can start next semester. So, yeah, I understand how that works. You need to basically submit like for your license or your like pre license or whatever. This is my practicum. That's like if I were to get a job job after school, this is like, this is technically still school, but it's on, on job training. So it's a class that I'm taking, but it's called practicum and it's literally just work. Yeah. Did you get a drink? No, I don't want to socialize with anybody. It looks like you're pretty close now. Yeah. I'm on 237th Avenue. You want to like stare at your phone or do you want to keep on the phone with me? I was looking at my map. No, you're okay. I just didn't know if you felt awkward, like you wanted to stay on the phone with me or if you wanted to hang your phone. No, I'm not going to get raped or anything. I can get. Are you okay? What color is the pizza? The pizza is on the table. No, it's okay. I'll see you in a few minutes. All right. Bye.",

I called you pocket dialed you or something like that. My bad. I don't matter. Yeah, I was actually gonna probably get ahold of you tomorrow evening if or maybe sometime in the noon and just kind of check on you. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it turns out things have changed. Yeah. Okay, because it said I didn't have no money in the bank and I would the bank $300 and then I would taxes yet. Turns out I got money in the bank. Okay, but I don't know the bank $300. That helps out. A lot is now I got to the 31st to pay the taxes. Oh, yeah, that's good. Well, it's nice that you're not stressing out about that. Well, I wasn't stressed out about it. But what can you do? Yeah, what can you do? No, it was definitely a little money. I had was all spoken for. Yeah. No, it's not. I got you. What is but it isn't. Right, right. I understand. So then do you have a figure or something like that or some sort of idea in mind that now or that you want me to pass along? I suppose around. I don't know. I can count it right now and maybe get some more but probably it could be much. Maybe. Maybe a grand at the most. That does anything or not? Yeah. Okay. Well, let me well, yeah, it's kind of I believe I try to try to get I guess whatever you can in order. I know that nothing's going to be happening tonight, but I think tomorrow when I go back to that area, I'm going to be available on you to help out. It is still that you got to get the money and go down there and come back. No, no. Well, I mean for that amount, no. To be larger than that. Then yes. All right. Is that you know? Really when? It ain't worth it running back and forth and shit like that. I mean it is but so I'm fucking around. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's been on. Yeah, I was back in the days when I enjoyed driving now. I yeah, I can't do all these extra trips. You can drive. We know you can drive legal now, right? Well, technically any vehicle that I drive has to have that breathalyzer machine in there. For three years, you know, and that's a good question too, because I'm not I got to talk to them and see how much time I actually have left because it's got to be like I have a couple months to go now. I don't know, but they're the ones that determine that shit. Yeah, they change it. Yeah, I know one guy's been on it for 13 years. Really? Yeah. That's weird. That's bullshit. That's bullshit. Ain't it? What does he have? Like, do you know if he has like 10 fucking DWIs or what? I don't know how many he's got but he's got to have a couple at least but then he's just about off. Fucking they do something. Another guy had to do it for an extra year because they just said, yeah, you better do it for another year. Mm-hmm. Fucking bullshit deal. Yeah. Yeah, if I can it is crazy. I just recently found out that there's like some form that I can file that like reduces my fees because like right now I'm haven't even driven since October and I got like a $450 bill. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and yeah, what else was I gonna see is fucking yeah. But yeah, I'm not going to be driving and it's going to so yeah, that way I avoid getting into trouble that sort of thing. I like to stay in law abiding as possible. Yeah. Hold on. All right. Well, let me let me finish up what I'm doing. Yeah, right. So tomorrow I'll probably like tomorrow afternoon. I'll touch base the and kind of make sure that things are kind of still in order. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. Take care. I'll talk to you soon. All right there.",

Well, I was actually just about to take his temperature, but I got like kind of distracted doing other things, but he's about to fall asleep. So yeah, let me go do it quick. He's chill for the most part. Right. Did you give him any medicine? No. You should like, if it's a lie. I'll let you know what's going on in a second. He really doesn't seem to have really any symptoms besides being like slightly like a little lethargic. Actually, I wouldn't even call it that. He's literally just laying sprawled on the floor. You're like, there's like no symptoms. He's just slightly lethargic. I mean, if you remember, like we, he took, they took his temp like right when we got there and it was fine. No, not really. He just walked in. I just told you that he took his temperature this morning. I'm the guy that holds him every day. So it was fine then and then it like comes up hot later on. I think it's in one of the pockets on like, you know, by the changing table because the kids were playing with it. Yeah. Did you find it? Hold on a second. Can you talk to my brother about picking up Alex later? I can't remember how to use this thing. Okay, so go to like, go through the settings until it says like Celsius or Fahrenheit, like C or F, and then you hold it down on that setting and then it'll change it to Fahrenheit. Um, Here we go. So how do you get it to fucking scan like, uh, like you're so put it on one temple and you hold the button and slide it across his forehead and let go of the button once you get to the other side. Okay. So I'm 98.5. 98.5, baby. Okay. Does he feel hot? No, he looks fine. He's fucking he's fine. He's like 100%. Well, I would give him some Tylenol just to be safe. Why? Because you only give him Tylenol when his body's hot. Yeah. Yeah, but I did tell him that, but we were talking about a large, a long variety of things. I don't expect him to remember that specific detail. So you, if you want to like give him a call, text him, uh, ask him 15 questions. Okay. I'm just kidding. No, I'm, but I actually, uh, kind of, I moved the router to, so it's like at the, in the fucking utility closet right across from our room. And, um, what else did I do? Cleaned up a little bit, cleaned up that fucking, uh, wagon that was in the bedroom and, uh, like vacuumed it out. Did you find another present in there? In where? In the wagon or behind the wagon? Cause I just remembered, I do like remember seeing a certain present that I got Alex and I could have swore I remembered like it coming, but I don't know where it is now. But if it's wrapped, how am I supposed to know? No, it's not wrapped. That's what I'm trying to say. Like when I was wrapping their gifts, I don't remember seeing it. There is no present in this area that is not wrapped. I put everything on the bed and that's where it is right now. Weird. Well, I guess I'll look at my thing and just, I don't know, I guess look later, but yeah, my boss is technically here and I'm supposed to be shadowing with someone, but okay. I'll talk to you in a little bit. Okay. All right.",

You told me to get up and get my steps in and then you're going to comment about the rude thing I said to you like it was unwarranted. I don't fully understand how that expression could be taken in such a terrible way. I didn't imply me basically having you. It could imply that you were calling me fat. It could imply that you're calling me lazy. Dude. That's you that did all that and you should know that I don't think of you in that light and I don't ever use it in a derogatory manner. I'm just letting you know that's how it could be perceived so maybe don't tell people to go get their steps in. Maybe I should tell people to fucking fly Atlanta and who gives a fuck?

To report an absence or to speak to someone in the attendance office, please press one. For the counseling office, please press two. For the athletics and activities office, please press two. For the commercial high school counseling office, this is Teresa. Hey Teresa, this is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Hi, good thanks. Appreciate you calling back. Yeah, yeah, I almost, I almost forgot and then I seen you on my voicemail. So yeah, how's your day going? I'm kind of slow actually without students here, but it's going. Yeah, it's much quieter than usual. I'm just wondering, is there a time on Monday morning you'd like to come in and meet Ava's counselor and get a schedule made? One second. I actually am not allowed to make decisions on the schedule without somebody else. Okay, let me just put you on a brief hold, okay? Okay, one second. Okay. Okay. Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. Okay. What's up? I'm going to put you on a three-way call. Can you, did you hear me? Teresa? Yes, I'm here. Hey Teresa, I was able to get a hold of Ava. So Ava right now, this is the guidance counselor from John Marshall's high school. Hi. Hi, I'm just wondering a time that might work on Monday the 5th for meeting Ava's counselor and getting a schedule made? Yeah, Ava, I need you to kind of look at mom's calendar if you could real quick and kind of help us determine a time that you guys can go in there on Monday. She has to get up. I know, I'm sorry. It's all good. Mm-hmm. Would some time around here see that working? Just find mom. What? I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you say, Ava. I'm next to mom now. Oh, okay, perfect. Could you put her on the phone then or let her know what time we're looking for works? He's on the call with the guidance counselor at John Marshall. I must be letting you know when it works. That's not going to work right now. Not right now, on Monday. Monday the 5th? I don't care when Ava works. Anytime before tomorrow, anytime during the day before at 4, except for tomorrow, I work double. Okay, the counselors are actually off for two weeks break. So would Monday morning the 5th, like 8.30 work? Would that be okay? Yeah, that would work. Okay, we can do that. And then just checking, do you know, are you within the busing zone? I do not know that right now. I know that for the middle school, we're not within the busing zone. Okay, they don't automatically assign bus routes for older students, but I can give you a phone number if you'd like to call and check to see if Ava would qualify for transportation. I'm probably just going to drive her because I already dropped the other two off, so I can just drop her off after that. Oh, sure. I mean, that's fine. If that works, that would be all good. So we'll plan on 8.30 Monday morning the 5th then, if that works for you. Sounds good. Okay, sure. And then just park in the visitors parking lot closest to the main entrance of the school, door one, the flagpole circle drive entrance there. There will be someone at the door to greet you and direct you down the hall to the counseling office, okay? Okay, sounds good. Okay, wonderful. Thanks so much. Have a great holiday break. Take care.

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? Hey, good. How are you doing, Brandon? Okay. Um, that was tricky. For some reason, I couldn't just click on it. I had to like download another app to be able to play it. Um, yeah. So were you just asking who that person was or what you should say to them? Yeah. Um, cause they, okay. Yeah. So that, so his name is Mahad. He, he deals with outreach with different programs. And so he is the person, um, that is in charge of like establishing and then, um, continuing those connections. If that makes sense, like on an official level, which is what that MOU process is and stands for. Um, and so, yeah, I mean, he's accessible. I could go see if he's in his office right now. Um, or if you have like a specific question, I guess, I'm not really sure about, uh, um, you know, where the conversation was taken after that clip was, you know? Okay. Um, so I guess, uh, this is in relation to that, that email, uh, that you and I were working on. I actually, I thought that I swear to God, I thought that I had sent it already, but as I was looking today, I was like, oh my gosh, it's still in my dress. That's embarrassing. So I actually, um, I had Heidi look at it real quick and she helped me make one last change on it. And, uh, and then I was reviewing the conversation with Huda, you know, with that phone conversation and she said that, and I was looking in the directory on connect team and I couldn't find like a Mahad in our, in our directory. So I was like, damn, if I'm going to CC the, like somebody besides you, because I did see like a blind copied you in that email. So you have a forward to that email. Um, also, uh, you know, blind copy, uh, this Mahad person, but I didn't know their contact information. Yeah, sure. Um, here, let me find it for you. Um, give me one moment. Cause I don't know if I can speak while you're looking for that, but on top of Lacey, well, thank you for that. Um, it was also mentioning that there's a female, um, she gave me her, her client number, but I don't know her name off the top of my head, um, transferring from some other place, uh, to, uh, okay. Her client ID is 2206, uh, she's transferring from, uh, someplace else, uh, to, and it's going to do like an inpatient, uh, recovering hope. And so if that's the case, like, um, I don't know, I just figured it was going to be kind of like kind of building on this communication between me and recovering hope and our organization. Yep. Yeah, absolutely. That's a perfect segue. That's like a, definitely a natural, um, starting point and, you know, from that interaction, you'll definitely build, build traction, build trust, you know, build ease. Um, you know, I'm really glad that that will, will, will work out. Um, do you know when that client is being transferred there? Um, um, she needs transportation on Monday, uh, yeah, potentially it'll be on Monday. Okay. Um, and is, is this client without a phone or have you made contact with her? Um, or were you just contacted or like notified from Lacey? Lacey did tell me that she doesn't have a phone. Okay. That's what I thought. Yep. Yeah. Okay. Um, okay. That is good. Um, good to know. Uh, so were you made aware about the client 1173? Um, just before I got on the phone with you, I seen that started between you, me and Lacey and the information about that at this time, what, what, what could you tell me more about that? Yeah. Um, so I guess he met with, uh, one of our peers named John the last, the past two days and that he no longer wants to go to St. Cloud and that he wants to quote, face his problems and not run from them. Um, she said that she suspects the same pattern of events in a couple of weeks, um, and just wanted to let us know, um, let me pull up what she sent me personally yesterday. Um, yeah, this is, this is a job person. So yeah. Yup. Yup. So she said this client's in full blown psychosis. He was evicted from a sober housing. He goes to treatment and the next day for intake, he cancels and he's chronically using. She said that he has schizophrenia and other mental health conditions along with the psychosis and that he's hearing and seeing, believing things that are not accurate. Um, so with that being said, it was, uh, I mean, I don't know, I guess in ongoing developing situation, as they say, you know, um, if for some reason he, he does have the intention and actual follow through, uh, to move, then by all means, I, you know, I think supporting him, you know, in any way you can is helpful. You know, I do think in some ways that while you're getting back, back started and back on track, like, you know, on a personal level, like not having to deal with that situation right now might be a blessing. Um, you know, and that there, there's also a blessing that there's a peer and a team of peers down there, whereas, you know, up there it would kind of potentially fall on your lap, whether directly or indirectly or consciously or subconsciously, um, you know, so, but just to update you on that, yeah, that he's right now going to be staying where he's at. Um, and if I hear something, I'll, I'll, I'll reach out to let you know, I'm sure Lacey will already probably be on top of reaching out to, you know, as well. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me, I think that 22 or six would probably be a better, um, better fit, I guess for right now, you know, and seeing as she would be like right there and in Laura, that would help on you, you know, for, um, you know, ease of access purposes. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. About the person. Yeah, I, I, that's the person I talked with you about, uh, over the last couple of days and I'm kind of like glad cause at some point I remember I, I tried to three way call Lacey with him on the phone and I didn't get through, but then she called me and she's like, yeah, John Gertz. And then she's like, kind of, you know, that'd be what she just told you that he's kind of in a psychosis right now and that he's, well, she didn't, she didn't use the word nuisance at all, but like me summarizing, um, you know, it's, it's been a little bit of a struggle with him getting into treatment and setting it up and then the last on the day of he'll like back out. So yeah, I can see if they're, if they're willing to, if they're able to make things work down there for him, that's, that's fantastic. I would like to see him successful wherever he goes and you're absolutely right. It may be a blessing in disguise for myself. Um, but the, so the two, two Oh six, um, and then, um, also reaching out to this Mohammed person, uh, so we're going to like, uh, like take a forward, the email that I just sent that forwarded you, I like forward him a version of it, like the, what I sent. So as like a little bit of a story or whatever, and then, um, and then I'll also in the email that I send them on Mohammed, I'll also add into that email, I, okay. We also have an additional client that's going to be transferring to recover and hope doing either an IOP or an inpatient program. And I just want to keep you in the loop, you know, just kind of give them just that little email. So that's, would you, would you concur to that as the correct? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Cool. Cool. I'm going to shut my door for a second and take you up to your phone. Okay. Dude. Um, I got a, so, uh, a little bit slightly not work-related, um, I was gonna, I was gonna ask you, cause you know, I, I super respect you as like where you're at in your recovery and there's like, you as a person and all that shit. And I don't know, I'm just going to like ask you, so like over the last two weeks I had and I don't fucking want to keep on banging this drum saying this shit, but like I had another like two, uh, close people of mine pass away and one was a suicide. And then the other was actually somebody I went to treatment with and they like, you know, as far as I know, they were doing really well. And then they had like, you know, like a one-time relapse and that relapse led to their untimely demise. And yeah, no, it's, I mean, um, I dunno, I just assume like, I dunno, I kind of feel like, I dunno, you, you, so you have been, you've obviously experienced the same thing I'm going through because like, it's like a common thing, but I dunno, I was just kind of hoping to hear your insight on it. Maybe like, I dunno if you got some like positive feedback or something like that I could like work with, cause it is kind of bothering me a little bit. Yeah, it's tragic. Any, anytime anybody dies, um, you know, I had to attend my best friend from high school, his funeral three weeks ago, um, fuck me, dude, that's so hard. Listen, his body was found half at another high school friend's house and half at a park. And so there was like six months since he was missing for two years. And then after they found his body at the park and then at the house, then they still haven't released it because of, uh, the investigation. Um, so, you know, that was tragic. He was one of the people that, um, you know, I hope to one day be able to bring back into the fold, you know, like he had struggled with his addiction, his addiction, his whole life. And, uh, you know, just when he went to prison, it kind of broke his spirit, you know, and when he got out, he wasn't saying, um, and, you know, he, he died, I'm assuming homeless on the street for a long time. You know, I want to say by choice, but he had a loving family, um, you know, so he was like probably like the seventh or eighth person I know that died from addiction. Um, you know, some people, like you said, they get clean for a little bit and you feel like there's hope and then something happens and they slipped at one time and, you know, they can't come back from that. Um, what I know that, you know, every time I think about them, I think about the decisions that I make on a daily basis that keep me away from that, you know, um, and it reinforces my own recovery and my own, you know, um, gratitude for life in general, you know, and the fact that I'm still here and that, you know, it's my mission to pay it forward every chance I get, um, you know, because everybody deserves a chance at life, you know, but we're also not the ones that like make the decisions that take them away. Right. Cause if it were up to us, we would save everybody, you know, um, Fuck man, damn, that's really sad. I'm really sorry to hear that, dude. That makes me sad hearing that what you, what you experienced and that shit really sucks. That's definitely a fuck. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, again, like we're, we're here, we're, we're alive, we're healthy, you know, we have families that depend on us that are the motivation, you know, to make the world a better place. Right. So, um, you know, we can, we can continue to do all the good work in the world, um, you know, in their memory, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I suppose that is the, that is the, probably the good, the good, uh, positive energy that, that I needed to hear, you know, like to try to convert this to like ammunition to continue to do the good that we're doing in this, in this role. Absolutely. I mean, that's kind of like this, like the, the ethos behind our job, right. We're able to take the pain and the negativity and the hurt that we've, you know, caused on ourselves and our loved ones in society, and then be able to like, learn the lesson from that, extract the positivity, and then only put that out, you know, um, in a ripple effect, you know? So hopefully we're planting seeds out here with, you know, our actions and our words that continue to, you know, benefit society in ways that we'll never know the true effect of, but. Yeah. We know that we're trying, you know, um, you know, and as far as that goes, like trying to like, again, like support our loved ones and, you know, teach them the lessons that we wish we knew, you know, teach our clients through our own experience and relating that like, you know, and showing them how to navigate through these situations and, because they do happen, you know, like, especially in recovery, you know, in long-term recovery, yes, people will die, you know, loved ones will die, um, you know, every situation is different, every relationship is different, you know, um, and everybody's relationship with death is different. So these are all like super ambiguous terms and things that, you know, probably until the day we die, we won't know exactly what's up with death or, you know, our relationship with it will change, you know. Yeah. So. Damn. I, I, I claim to be no expert, you know. Yeah. Yeah. You know, I don't think I've ever asked you this, but are you a veteran? No, no. Oh, okay. Yeah. You just used some terminology a minute ago that I was like, damn, dude, maybe, all right. But yeah, that's okay. Okay. Damn. Well, thank you, man. Fuckin. Yeah. I don't know, man. I got your back, dude. Like whether it's work or fuckin life or due to. I got your back too, Brandon. I got your back too, man. Yeah. For sure. I appreciate that, dude. Thank you. All right. I'm going to try to get back to work and I'm going to be productive yet today. And, uh. Oh, last question. Last question. Um, and I, I assume, so I don't really know the office etiquette for this and I assume that like Huda doesn't need to be like, like filled in on every piece of like, you know, literature that goes through this organization. But like when I email Mohammed, should I, uh, CC her? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Yep. That'd be perfect. Yeah. No. No, I, uh, I think that anytime, you know, you are at that crossroad, just go ahead and send it to her because it's not, uh, you know, it's no sweat off her back. I think just keeping her updated or having, you know, giving her the option to, to stay on top of the situation as it developed is a good thing, you know? So. I got you. Cool. Yeah. Yep. And then also CC, also like CCU as well. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Keeping, keeping me updated is good. I, I, I think keeping her updated would be also just as important, you know? Yeah. I just wasn't sure like what the protocol, like if it's like overkill or if that's an appropriate behavior. Nope. Yeah. No. Something like that. You know, if, if it was related to any like single given like service line, of course that would be like an enormous or gargantuan task, but she's the program manager. So everything is technically under her purview, you know, especially something new would just be good to keep her, you know, aware and abreast of. Got you. All right. Yeah, for sure. Yep. Thank you for asking though. Yeah. All right, man. All right. You got a busy day today or what? No, not really. I mean, just catching up on some supervisions. Sometimes people wait until the end of the week. But other than that, I don't have a whole lot planned. So just taking it easy, I guess. Okay. I got you. Oh, and this, does this qualify? Should this be our supervision thing? Yeah. Yep. Yep. Do I clock in for this? For our supervision for the week. So. I clock in for this. Is that correct? Yeah. Proper line to phone call has been. Yep. So we're at like 20 minutes. It's 1145 and just, you know, you can backdate your clock to like 1125. That's what I'm going to write down that we started. Okay. Copy. Yeah. All right. All right. Well, thank you. Thank you. If I have anything else, I'll reach out and I'll try to limit. So I don't call you fucking 10 times today, but. Don't worry about it. Feel free to reach out. I'm here to support you. All right, man. Thank you. I appreciate it. I hope you have a nice day. You're welcome. Yes, sir. You too. Have a good weekend. All right. You too. Bye.",

Yeah, well, I was, I was going to rent it, but then he ran into some money troubles. So he has to sell his house. So I, I have to move. Oh, I see. I see. Yeah, that's unfortunate. Yeah. How much are you paying there? Is it like a good deal or what? Well, no, I haven't been paying any rent. I've been looking for a job. I haven't had much luck with that. So it's just been setback after setback. And it's just, yeah. So, I mean, he was nice enough to let me stay here, you know, pretty much rent free, because he knew I was looking for a job and, but it just hasn't worked out. Yeah. Are you driving right now too? Well, I don't, I don't have a vehicle, but I do have a valid driver's license. Okay. Yeah. Because I was going to say, I do actually know of a place that's hiring, but I suppose you would need a vehicle to get there. Well, so he's, he's thinking about going to rehab and he might let me use his vehicle while he's in there. Okay. Yeah. Really? That'd be a good opportunity. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, because I, I have a valid driver's license. And so, I don't know, he wanted me to go to rehab with him, but I just, I kind of don't, I just want to start a life, you know? Yeah. Go to work, make money, get a place. Yeah, I know. Be like self-sufficient. I totally understand. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And I'm tired of being at homeless shelters and like depending on other people. Yeah, I know that can really like kind of take a toll on like, I don't know, your, how you kind of view yourself and how you're feeling, feeling about your goals and everything. Exactly. Well, yeah, I mean, you know, I sit around all day and watch TV. I mean, yeah, I look for jobs, but I mean, that only takes up so much time, you know, so then you have the whole rest of the day and it's like, what do you do with yourself, you know? So, does this gentleman that you're living with, that's getting, that's trying to get into treatment, if you were to start, if you were to get a job someplace, would he like be, like, would he allow you to use his vehicle to get to and from work? Yeah, yeah. I mean, he said, because we were talking about it, because I didn't, I didn't want to go to rehab. I think if I'm just, I can quit drinking on my own. I've been to rehab like three times and it's just being with him and he keeps getting like bottles, you know, but I mean, there's been like weeks where I went without drinking, but then, because he keeps getting bottles and brings it around me, you know, if it's around me, then yeah, I'm gonna give in, you know, I just need to not be around it. I need to have a job for something to do. You know, and, and he said that he was going to give me the, the car and, and some money, you know. Yeah. Well, so I could tell you a little bit about this, this place that I know that's hiring. I don't know if you're familiar with the company at all. It's called RTS and they're located right on Highway 10 and, shit, I forget what county road it's called, but it's like, got like, it's basically in like Becker. It's on Highway 10. It's where that Holiday is. I'm not sure if you're familiar with the area over there at all. But RTS is, is like a manufacturing company. It's where they make gun parts. And I actually have a friend of mine, like an old work colleague of mine from a different company. His wife works there. And I guess like the pay is pretty substantial. Like they start you out at like 18 bucks an hour. And yeah, and it's basically like, from what I've understood, it's like a great, great company to work for. Yeah. I don't know if you need to pass a drug test in order to start. I could find that out. I could find that out. But okay. Just based on like the location, the pay and the, the, the idea that I know that they're hiring right now. Yeah, we could look into that if you're interested in. Oh, really? Wow. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm, I'm somewhat familiar with, with, you know, all that. Yeah. The manufacturing aspect of it. Yeah. I mean, Okay, cool. That's kind of funny. Yeah, no, that's actually really super, really interesting. Yeah. I mean, because in my mind, like when I think about manufacturing, like I think it's like some of it like involves like working with your hands or your fingers and it could be like somewhat labor intensive, but sometimes you're like able to sit down for like the duration of your shift and do it. I don't know, like a lot of it kind of varies. There's so much like variables, but yeah, what you're explaining kind of sounds like that sounds like a good gig. Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. So where, so where is this place that you're located at? Like you're living at? Like, is it in St. Cloud or is it just outside or what? No, no. So I am, I'm in St. Cloud. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Um, yeah, you know, um, yeah. Well, I would, I'd like to be able to meet it with you sometime soon. I apologize the other day. You know, I think I, I called you or I messaged you somewhere in the middle of the night and it was like a wrong number. And because I thought that somebody, there was like, I had gotten some notification about somebody in crisis, and I think I called the wrong Colette. Oh, yes, that's right. Yes, I remember that. Yeah, sorry about that. No, no, no, that's totally fine. Yeah. Well, um, yeah, I mean, actually, if I also if I remember correctly, when we that one time that we did meet, I was able to actually successfully set set up your, your, your stuff for billing so like we can, we can actually work together whenever you want. And, you know, I don't know, pick a pick a day of the week. And that can be like, so usually the people that I work with, like the clients, like I, I like, I let them choose like, you know, I can meet with you, you know, three times a week, and I let you pick the time and, and then like, basically, it's a four hour block. And, you know, all I'll show up, and we'll work together as much as you want. And we just kind of like we identify what your goals are. And we like we work at it together, kind of like I was describing that one day, I'm just like, like, I work for you. I'm like your copilot. And I'm, I'm just here to kind of make sure, like, we're working together and on like, you know, what's this little obstacle or what's this little obstacle or maybe my insurance is is about to lapse, or maybe I need a car or find work. And that's, that's what I help with is. And as much as I don't like to advertise this part, but like, if it comes down to like me giving you a ride someplace or to a food show, like I'm also, I'm also that guy. Okay. Yeah. Although I like to be I like the more cerebral part of this job where I can help you with connect those bigger dots. But yes, if you need a ride to the grocery store, I'm super there for you. Okay. Okay. No, that sounds that sounds great. Did you know that though? Did you know that? No, I didn't know that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm like, I'm your homie, and I work for you. So it's honestly, I wish I wish that I when I was going through all my shit. I wish that I had somebody that was able to like kind of keep me on track because, you know, you know, for yourself, like, you know, life fucking sucks sometimes. And Oh, yeah, it does. It's hard. Yeah, dude, adulting is terrible, dude. It's fucking terrible. It is. It is. And I don't know, just having somebody like a homie that you know, isn't gonna fucking stab you in the back. And it's gonna like help you keep you on track. And it's gonna like help you meet your goals. That's priceless, priceless. Yeah, yeah, definitely. So, um, you so when I called the my number come up is like, I don't know this person, or did you actually say my number? No, it just came up and I just answered. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, well, definitely definitely save save my number. I can like text you my like my first and my first name and my title or whatever. Just so you can like save it in your phone. Yeah, yeah, definitely do that. And, um, yeah, I guess kind of wherever you want to go from here. If you have a couple of days in mind that you're available that either I could come to you or you can come to me or something in between. Do you have anything available on like Monday because I know I know today's Friday. Um, yeah, I, I do have. I have a tentative thing that I might be doing on Monday but that's super tentative and, but I can I can set aside time on Monday. Okay, or we can do Tuesday too. I mean, I'm not picky. I mean I don't I don't really have a schedule so. Yeah. Or, yeah, or we can do both days whatever's clever. Okay. And, yeah, we would you want to me to come out to where you're at, or would you want to like, like I could pick you up, we'd go to like a coffee shop or I could come over your place, or you can come, I can bring you back to my office, any of those options are out there. It's kind of whatever you're most comfortable with. No, I can, I can meet you at your office. Yeah, are you sure because I know you said the vehicle thing is kind of a obstacle I don't want to know no no I can, I can, I can borrow it. Okay, I'm over there. Yeah. Okay. And, um, um, so on Monday, and then, and then I know you said so just I've been taking notes since we've been talking. Maybe, maybe on Monday or Tuesday, whichever kind of works out best. And, and I don't know if you want to do like, like a soft like set aside that time on Monday, whatever that time is, and then we'll, we'll meet like every week, or. Yeah, maybe Monday, Monday, because in my select the clients that I do have. Why actually I just had to transfer a couple of my clients out to other people, because I was working out in the cities. I was working in the cities like the first half of the week. Oh, okay. And I had like three or four clients, and I would meet, like, I would meet with, like, each of those clients like Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. And so it would be like, you know, every Monday, I meet with that person, Tuesday I meet with that same person, Wednesday I meet with that same person. And, and I just do them like back to back. But, um, um, see, what was I going with that. But yeah, so right around like, uh, yeah anytime for like 11, 11 to like two o'clock is kind of like the best times. Okay. Probably, I could probably actually just maybe around 11. Is that, is that okay with you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, let's plan on that. Okay. Yeah, that works. Oh yeah, that's what I was gonna say. Um, um, so the work thing. Uh, yeah, so on Monday, I could probably plan to meet with you at that time, and then I don't know if we want to like ride together. So about this application, I don't know, I can't remember if it's an online application, or if it's an in person application, but either way, like if it's a if so if it's an, if it's an in person one, then we could meet up, and then we could like drive out there and grab it. And, and, and if it's an online application, we could just do it, like, you know, wherever, wherever it is we're meeting. Yeah, yeah. Okay. All right, well do you have any questions for me. Um, no, not right now. I'm not overwhelming you am I. No, no, no, you're fine. Would you even tell me if I was. Yes, I would definitely tell you. Yes. Well, I look forward to working with you and meeting with you again, I really enjoyed the time that we did have in our in my little last, you know, office when we were hanging out. Yeah, yeah, me too. Yeah. Okay, well I look forward to meeting with you again, and I'll give you a call probably like early Monday morning or maybe even Sunday night just to kind of confirm our appointment time. Yeah, yeah, that sounds good. Okay, cool. All right, well I'll talk to you soon. Okay. Bye. Bye.",

All right, so I was just I was just going through connecting and I seen in the jet all-generation hope cat a Message from a Zach saying only 18 people have filled out the scheduling form every CPR. Yeah, fill out this form today and That is a red flag for me because I know that I have not filled out this form and I was wondering if you just kind of Bring me up to speed like quickly What what it is? Yeah, so it's just a classification form. It's gonna ask you Are you a full-time employee or a part-time employee and you're a part-time and it'll ask you for your Availabilities as far as like morning noon or night Or I think it might even be like in four different four-hour blocks like 8 to 12 12 to 4 4 to 8 8 to 12 And that's just something that we can have on file for the state of Minnesota so when they ask or When they see, you know You know, that's like another tool that we have for the PTO so that then if somebody is asking for full-time Pay for what they usually work that we can say. Oh, yeah. Well you are you know Scheduled, you know for you know Shift every day of this week or or you typically have work. Oh You know four to five days a week for the last, you know, four to eight weeks or whatever and then you would qualify for Certain benefits, you know, I think that also has to do with like Sick time, you know earned family and sick time as well as like this new family leave law Etc. Oh You know, so yeah, so it's not Not to like confuse you or be like a big Big thing It's just kind of like a formality, you know, they want to know You know who they can call on during certain times, right? So if we have like a list of like people that we know would be available Early night or late morning or excuse me? Yeah late night or early morning, you know, then then we'll have like an idea, you know Mm-hmm, so it's not meant to limit you in your hours or capabilities whatsoever. It's not you know Like if you say you don't want to work on a Sunday, but you happen to like, you know Take a call on a Sunday like that's fine, you know So, yeah, all right. All right. Yeah, cuz I was just I I know that with one of my last conversations with a bag was kind of revolving around Getting my fit together and making sure that I have at least my 21 hours or 25 hours and 20 hours, but yeah, yes. Yeah 20 hours, but yeah, yeah Yeah So, okay, so but that doesn't have much to do with this form No, no, no no, so no matter who you are with the company whether you're part-time or full-time the expectation is that you won't get get to and Up to and then keep like a 20 hour average, right? And so the people that are full-time or people that work 40 hours on average, which is very few people That deal with strictly clients, you know as admin have 40 hours because we have Dual roles or multiple roles within the company. Mm-hmm. So it's like a salary thing and it's not hourly But Yeah, I mean, yeah as far as you're concerned, you know, you You know been working towards getting up to that 20 hours this whole time. So we're still here It's important to you in that, you know so Nothing. Nothing changes for you on a day-to-day basis. That's like what you're asking Okay, I got you Okay, all right. All right. Well, I'm just just uh, I'll fill out that that That form real quick. Okay, and I'm just an update I've still got one more client that I'm trying to reach out to this morning this afternoon But I did get just get off the phone with one of them Colette Available client that I had onboarded, you know months ago and I think she kind of like lost my contact information and But I like just got off the phone with her and kind of you know had a great conversation It sounds like every Monday and Tuesday I'm moving forward. I'm gonna meet with her And she's out in this area as well Nice. Yeah. Yeah, so that's a that's a huge plus Yeah, cuz yeah, I'm I don't know I'm like kind of like on the edge of my seat like man I need to get my fucking hours up because like if if I don't a Zach's gonna fucking can me cuz I don't know that last conversation I had with a Zach was kind Of like it was a little dark. I don't know. Yeah Well, I think that there's putting forth your effort and showing up is what's asked of you You know, like we'll eventually get the hang of it and get the follow-through and get the engagement Um, I think it's just you know like I was explaining last week is it's It's not meant to limit you and what you do But but what it's asking you to do what you said you're going to or what was asked of you You know, so as long as you're showing up three times a week in st. Cloud Then you can do what else you want if that makes sense, you know Mm-hmm, like it's a client-led program. We're at their kind of whims as far as like Availability or engagement is concerned, but there still stands to like You know, there's patterns of behavior or or signs of effort on both sides if that makes sense So, you know if there's continuously presented opportunities that aren't followed through on then that's like where the problem lies it's not so much like You know meant to like scare you or definitely not meant to deter you from you know meeting clients or from creating service lines so Okay Yeah Okay, I understand Okay, and you know you telling me about these different people is is good, um And in signs of good progress and good faith Um, it's just a matter of following through on them following through on creating the documentation for that So that then I can point to that and and and advocate for you if that makes sense. Yeah You know Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, thank you, I appreciate that but like as far as that is concerned like you told me the other day Like on monday that you met with the client and I asked you to create the note and when I looked this morning I didn't see it there yet So like that's an example of like even if you're doing the work you have to create the the paper trail or the breadcrumbs for it to like Be real if that makes sense, you know Because I could say hey, well he met him but You know, he didn't do the service line, but then it's like, okay Well, did you why didn't he do the service line? Did you ask him to do the service line? And then why didn't he do it after you asked him? You know what? I mean? It just creates more questions. Oh, so yeah. Yeah, you're talking about that Yeah, I understand Okay, I did I did actually you know, like I said, I hear you like absolutely like about these, you know Different people places and things and updates on them. It's just like a matter of like making something You know making it resonate, you know, and again like you have to like Do the documentation otherwise it you know, it doesn't matter what was happened or what was said or what we've done you know Totally understand Um, but you got this you're you're you know, I mean tackling a couple things at once and so I understand there's you know, um You know a priority of things I also understand it's been uh the holidays and I also understand like You feeling sick. I also understand like being like mentally, you know still trying to like smooth things out so I want you to know that you are understood and that your situation is like Taking into consideration for sure I appreciate that a lot. Well, thank you. Yeah, you're welcome. You're welcome Okay. All right. I'll get back to it Okay, sounds good. Well, thank you for calling to ask and I'll talk to you later. I'll talk to you soon Okay. Bye",

    "transcript": "Hello this is Brandon. Hey Brandon, it's Mahad for this Mahad call. Hey Mahad, how are you doing? I'm good, I'm good. I saw your email that you sent me earlier. I was out of the office today, but I definitely saw it and I just wanted to get some context and some updates for you. Okay, cool, cool. Yeah, yeah. So my main thing was, A, I know that you live in Mora, correct? Correct. I spoke with someone on their team, it's kind of, someone in the same kind of similar role as me. It's kind of their community outreach person, I suppose. And it was maybe, what, two weeks ago? And they were telling me about, I don't know if, correct me if I'm wrong, but they have peers that work there currently. That is true, that is accurate. Yeah, they do have like one or two, I think they have like two CPRSs that they keep on staff. Exactly, so my biggest thing was kind of, hey, there's two angles for me to look at it, right? It's A, I would obviously want them to say, hey, once someone gets out of treatment, to make sure that we can go and have the transition over to a CPRS from our team. That's kind of something that I brought up to them about a potential partnership, as well as kind of say, we could reference some of our people that we work with, our partners, et cetera, for treatment, if need be, in the area where we, obviously. You there, okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm there. Sorry, I'm trying to take you off my Bluetooth so I could hear you better, I think. No, that's okay, that's okay. So, yeah, I'm just really just trying to see kind of where that, like, you know, that partnership would fit. They seem, obviously, they seem kind of, you know, interested in it, but it's just the biggest thing that kind of struck out to me was the fact that they already had peers there, so I was like, well, it's not like I can transition peers to work inside the facility, you know? And I immediately was like, okay, Brandon lives in Morris, so that would obviously be a great, you know, thing to do, but I don't know if that's something they would be interested in. Right, yeah, yeah, and honestly, this is all pretty new to me, too. Like, I mean, I've got some, like, entrepreneurial background before getting into this kind of role, so, I mean, I can understand how, like, two companies can kind of, like, partner and work together and have, like, but then there's, like, HIPAA and, you know, all these other things, so I do understand the obstacles and, I don't know, I've heard, because I've had these conversations with, like, my supervisors and, you know, CUDA and just trying to, like, learn and gain more understanding of, like, what these sort of relationships look like, because there's more than one treatment center out in the Mora area. Oh, there's another one? Yeah, yeah, there's one in Pine City called Project Empower, and I have actually had, like, a video conference with them in the past to kind of basically kind of make an assessment if there's anything we could do to, like, help each other on a professional level, and at the time we, I think she explained to me that she had, they also had CPRSs that they hire, and that, I don't know, it was a learning experience, honestly. Right. So, maybe you could explain to me in some other scenarios that, like, we do partner with other companies that, like, what do those memorandum of trust look like, partnerships look like? So, really, so it could be shelters, treatment centers, shelter, I mean, sober houses, all types of different things, right? But the biggest thing, really, that we look for is to be able to provide those peer recovery services in those facilities. If, for example, like, Recovering Hope, there's a situation where they already have peers, the biggest thing that we would, A, target is, hey, those certain peers that work at Recovering Hope aren't going to be able to provide peer recovery services for those folks after they complete treatment. So, the biggest thing for us would be the continuum of care and making sure that those people still have those peer recovery services within their, you know, obviously, something that they can use. Like, those clients can actually have a peer available to them because more of Recovering Hope wouldn't be able to do that, provide that service anymore. Right. So, obviously, that's the biggest thing. That's one. Secondly, really, obviously, I would say, hey, I could always bring up the fact that, hey, this is something that you guys are paying, it's an expense that's coming out of your, obviously, your accounts on a month-to-month basis to pay these peers. We can take over and make sure that you guys don't have that problem. It's not an expense anymore. We can take over. But that's something that people may not be inclined to offer off the bat, and that's more of a trust-based relationship with a treatment center that we already have a connection with. So, that's something that I don't push heavily unless there's already a relationship there. But with that being said, those are the two biggest things. Also, really having a partnership in the sense of, hey, we're offering the ability to bring, we have, we work with well over 300 clients in the state at any moment. So, if there's someone that may need to go back to treatment, someone has a relapse, someone has a person that they wanted to refer for treatment because they wanted to get sober, we would offer that treatment center, hey, when we get these clients, we'll reach out to you so that we can provide these clients to you for treatment services. And that's what a partnership would usually look like. Right. Okay. Yeah, yeah. All right. I'm starting to get a better idea. So, it's kind of parallel in the sense of they're helping us, but we're helping them too, you know? Right. Right. So, I can understand. So, let me run an example. I'm just kind of thinking out loud. So, in the event that you had mentioned earlier that Recovering Hope, they have CPRSs, but once their clients move either out of network or are done with their programming, like their IOP program, then like their services cease. Yep. And so, in a partnership thing, we could be, we could like approach them and offer to assist with clients that are, that already have plans to move outside of their network or plans that are or work with their clients that, you know, are going to be like finishing up with their programming soon. I mean, so that's one possibility of working with another company like that, right? Right. Or what else? Somebody else actually said something when I talked to him the other day. I think it was my supervisor, Miles, mentioned like maybe they have like, they have like a need in their organization where that involves like onboarding people and they would be willing to have us, like a CPR, one of our CPRSs assist with their onboarding processes for them. And I don't know if that's, I mean, it sounds like a thing. Definitely, definitely. But yeah, yeah, so I guess, so it sounds like I'm on the right track. No, you most definitely are. Okay. Yeah, man, I love the idea of being able to partner with other recovery community organizations. And yeah, I'm just very new at it. Right. But you, correct me if I'm wrong, just to clear my, help me get my understanding. How long have you been a peer at Generation Oak? I started, I got hired in June. Fair enough. Yeah, yeah. And this is a career change for me. Like before this, I was a contractor and a realtor and yeah, basically an entrepreneur. I've been an entrepreneur like my whole life, pretty much. Right, right, right. So actually, so what was my last question? Wait, say that again. You had a last question you said? Yeah, yeah. I was just kind of thinking out loud, like what was my last question? Go ahead, take your time, man. So where do you think things should go or like how the conversation should go from when I respond to that email? Because I'm going to follow up with that email that I sent to that LADC. Was it Ann? Was it Ann Thompson? Ann Thompson, yeah, yeah. Yeah. I mean, she hasn't reached back out to you yet, right? No, no, she hasn't. Okay. So once she does, obviously, just really, like I said, I kind of brought up the continuum of care for, how was that? Let me see. Let me see what I said exactly. If I can pull it up. Recover earning hope. Let's see if I can find it. Recover. Let me see if I can just find it in my logs. Three, two, zero, 12, 17, incoming call, nine minutes. Incoming call, 17 seconds. I'm trying to see. Bear with me a second. No problem. Let me see if I can find it in my email. Recovering hope. I don't have it, but what I will say is this. I talked to that other person, that community outreach. I think her name is Christie, if I remember correctly. But I kind of just brought up the continuum of care, and that's what I'd recommend you'd say as well. And also, if they have any questions, really, to go deeper into it, they can always reach out to me. I just don't. I just am kind of someone who's a hard person to get hold of sometimes. So I just saw that from my experience, because I reached out like two or three times. So just be wary of that. But yeah, really, the continuum of care is definitely something I would push. So I'll just go from there. And then I can have that conversation of what we can offer as well as, hey, if there's ever, we see a lot of clients that we work with that might potentially have, like, we see people have relapses and need to go back to treatment. And that's something that we can reference for you guys and refer to you guys in the future within a partnership. Okay. So, you know, one of my co-workers, Rami Strong. Yeah, I don't know. Um, actually, I was just kind of, I've known Rami for a couple of years now. And, but I just was made aware that he's one of my co-workers recently. And then I thought I learned that he actually is kind of specializes in some of these partnerships, like one of these, it was, I forgot the name of the organization, he kind of leads the connection with some sort of church organization. Yeah, something. I'm not sure exactly what the name is, but I know what you're talking about. And, uh, yeah, I guess I haven't connected with him yet, since I've kind of learned that he's a co-worker of mine, but I was kind of interested to hear more about some of his endeavors just so I kind of get a better idea of different sort of connections, like, aside from, like, the one at Recovering Hope. Exactly. But yeah, well, I'm really glad that you reached out right away. And of course, so far, I've gotten a lot out of this convo, and I'm going to follow up. And when I do mention the continuation of CARE. Of course, please do. That'd be good. And if, like I said, if they ever have any questions or anything that's deeper, like they can always reach out to me, they can reach out to Huda. But really, this is like, this is the biggest role that I play in, because I'm big on bringing in partnerships. That's really, like, my biggest thing in working in the organization. So, I spend a lot of time out in different shelters and different facilities, just kind of working with the folks that work in those facilities to kind of bring Generation Hope on into new, you know, new places. Right, right, definitely. Okay, well, I, and is this number that you called from? Is this a good number for me to get a hold of you back? Anytime. It's my personal number, so feel free to reach out to me whenever. Well, obviously, just shoot me a text if you have any questions, context, you know, I'm here for you, man, so. Okay, cool, cool. I super appreciate that. Of course. Okay, well, thank you, Mahad. And hopefully, I'll be hearing, you'll be hearing from me soon. Most definitely, man. I appreciate your call. I appreciate you reaching out to me with that email. Just once again, if there's any kind of context or update you have for me, just feel free to shoot me a text whenever, man. Okay, perfect. I'll do that. All right, brother, you take it easy and enjoy your weekend, okay? All right, you too. Thank you. All right, man.",

Let me step away for a second. Yeah, man, how you been? I'm alright. Yeah, yeah, man, sorry, I I haven't been, like, ignoring your Yeah, Brandon, Brandon. What up, dog? I just, I was, like, trying to think about Brandon. I'm like, what? What is, uh, what are you up to, dude? Uh, right now, well, right now, uh, well, I got done with work and then immediately after that I had to go, I had to go out to Bolero. And, uh, do, like, a family thing with the extended family and all that shit. Oh, yeah, yeah. Like, white people shit, you know. Yeah, yeah, I know that. I just skipped it this year. Fucking, uh, fucking, uh, what was I gonna say? Um, so, I don't know, have you talked to Amigo? Uh, the last time he sent me a message was on Tuesday, I seen. And then, uh, but, uh, I did talk to him, like, right before that, right before you, like, kind of before and after you hit me up the first time. Yeah, well, um, so I talked to him and he was, he asked me to fucking, uh, to talk to you or get a hold of you. He doesn't know what you're up to or, like, um, I don't know, are you fucking, are you trying to, like, uh, fucking get to know me or what? Yeah, absolutely, I am, yeah. And, uh, well, the thing is, like, so, uh, I know, I know the fucking, the gist of it, like, we don't really mess around with shit that's less than, like, less than a full bird, you know? And then, so, like, uh, and I've had, like, some of my old clients and then, like, uh, like a new client that, like, I was, kind of, willing to work with, like, I've been, like, kind of in touch with them and then, like, like, trying to, because it sounds like, I don't know, like, I was, like, basically, like, one, one a week just for this one person and, and that would have been awesome and, but now she's, like, I don't know, not in a great mental state, so, uh. Oh, yeah, you don't add to that, dude, in terms of liability. Exactly, so, like, but there's other, other people I've been speaking with just even today that, like, are good opportunities and shit like that and then I have, like, so, I mean, I have, like, and some, like, long, I have, like, a long-distance client that is, like, a long-standing person that I've, like, worked with that's, like, it's always, like, super fucking beneficial for me to work with and he's been waiting on me to, like, hook him up for, like, probably, like, close to two months and I'm, and I could kind of fill you in more about that, in case. Anything more than what we're talking about, it's about being personal. Copy. So, I don't know, I fucking tend to see him, like, twice a week or whatever. No, not him, but, per se, but I understand. Oh, yeah, so, so, like, uh, I don't know, I mean, you want to fucking, you want me to, see, I'm trying to think, where are you living at now? I live out in Mora. Mora, okay. Yeah, which is a fucking hike and... Yeah, but it's a lot closer than where you were staying, right? Way the fuck out in, uh... Right, yeah, yeah, yeah, because I did move, I moved fucking really far away for a while there. Yeah, that's what Phoenix was saying. I think she might have even been staying out there, I'm not sure, but, fucking, uh, I know it was a hike because my dad moved to New London and it was way past that. Yeah, yeah, but it's in that same area, though, you got, you got the right idea. Yeah, okay, so, my dad moved to New London and I don't see him nearly enough, but... Yeah. So, um, you say you meet with his, his, uh, workers like about twice a week? Yeah, yeah. And that's good. Um, uh, let's see, I... What was my turn? Sometimes more if need be, you know. Okay. Well, um, I mainly just wanted to, like, you know, I seen you put, you dropped your phone number, so I wanted to give you a call, so you had mine. Yeah, yeah. And then, uh... Yeah, when he asked me, he just, so one thing he was, he was, he asked me about was, uh, sometimes it, there's a long time goes between messages that you send him. Yeah, he doesn't like that. I know he doesn't do it, he fucking, he says to me, dude, you can look at my message, he's like, why don't you respond? Why, why is it taking so long to answer? Yeah. I'm like, that's the same shit I say, but, uh, fucking, uh, I don't know. I guess, like, why did it take so long to get here when you called me an hour ago? Right. But, uh, yeah, it's still, I mean, if you want to work something out with him, dude, otherwise there's only, you can fucking, uh, you can always fucking, uh, jump in the car with us or whatever, dude. Yeah, well, I mean, I've worked out a price with him in the past, and I don't know, I assume that working with you, the price would be the same. Is that an accurate statement? I'm not sure what he agreed with you on. Okay. Well, I'm standing in my bowling lane with a bowling ball in my hand. Tell me when you get some free time or if you're ever in Anoka, dude, I live right on the river. Fucking, uh, I got a nice place right on the river, you just feel free to stop by, dude. Alright, copy that. Thank you. Yeah, so hit me up when you're in Anoka. Alright, I'll, yeah, I'll call you when I can talk more. Alright, sounds good, bud. Alright, thank you.",

Yeah, my supervisor didn't come in today, um, because I guess she's dog-sitting. Okay. Yeah, she sent me a couple pictures. It was kind of cute. I was thinking about maybe stopping over there, but then again, like, I've never been over to her place, and I don't really know if I want to, like, entertain that all those dogs are so cute that much that I want to go fucking visit her on a Saturday. Right. Have some decorum, Brandon. She's your supervisor. She's not your friend. Actually, technically, she's not a supervisor anymore. She's just the lead for this area now. Oh. Is it the one chick, the fucking one that you were talking to, and she was telling you her whole life story? No. No, no, no. No, that's her. That lady, that chick that was telling the life story, that's, uh, she's, uh, the program coordinator. Oh, okay. For, like, the entire company, so she, like, actually, I don't know, she's basically, like, one of the most in-charge, I don't know how to put it, she's like the fucking boots on the ground. She, everything goes through her, essentially. Yeah. Okay. But she has the hots for me, I'm pretty sure. Yeah. Yeah. Do you want to see a picture of her? Sure. Here. Hold on. Yeah, I, uh, onboarded this person, and then, uh, he was saying that, um, he's got this, he's got, yeah, he's... Alright, I'm sending that picture to you right now. That's her, that's her company profile picture. I did not know that. Oh, it's cold. Yeah, basically, uh, I spent, like, 15 minutes, essentially, like, 15 minutes onboarding them, because, like, I'm, like, pretty quick at doing it now, and, like, the rest of, and I built, I was, like, on the clock for admin time for, like, a little less than an hour and a half. Yeah. And, um, yeah, most of the time I, we were over at, like, his client's, like, because he does, like, construction work. Uh-huh. He had to do, like, a bunch of, like, touch-up and, like, small repairs at this group home. Yeah. And, um, yeah. So he's, like, yeah, if you want to help me, he's, like, I'll pay you, and I'm, like, you don't got to pay me, but, like, here's the deal, like, I'm going to enroll you, like, today, whether you like it or not, and, uh, you don't have to pay me for any other work that I do to help out. So I was, like, painting and doing some, like, drywall and mudding. Yeah. Yeah. Just kind of bringing some of my construction knowledge to help him in his situation. Yeah. I just realized, fucking, so I ran into one of my old coworkers, Aaron. He, like, stopped by because he was getting his necklace fixed or something, some jewelry fixed across the way from where my table's set up. There's, like, a jewelry store, and he was talking to me, and he stole my pens. What, did you only have, like, one pen? No, I mean, I have, like, my personal pens, but, like, these are the, like, work pens that I leave out on the table so people could fill out those sheets, and I had two on the table, and I just looked at my table, and I'm, like, they're gone. Both of them? Yeah, both of them, and so I just, there was more, so I just pulled out more from the box that we have here, but it just threw me off. I was, like, where the fuck did the pens go? That's fine. But, yeah. I just got the picture of the, your lady looks exactly like I thought she'd look. Yeah? Is that exactly how? Yeah, I was envisioning someone looking like that, and I was, like, dude, I'm going to be so thrown off if she doesn't look like what I think, and then it was exactly what I thought. Dude, actually, I'm kind of curious, and I want to, like, just out of pure funniness, I'm going to... Huh? Just out of pure funniness, I'm going to fucking have Google, like, do a thing, like, Google Photos do, like, one of those remixes or whatever you call it. Yeah. I want to see what she looks like as a cartoon character. Oh, my God, you're weird. Do you think it'd be, like, I don't know... So what are you doing now? Are you just waiting for me now, or are you still working? I'm at a stoplight. I'm following Dagan back to his place to, like, get rid of all the garbage and stuff we loaded into his truck, and I'll probably spend the rest of my time with, like, waiting for you with him. Yeah. Kind of, like, just taking notes and kind of getting, because, like, I'm not allowed to bill for him my time with him, but... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Huh. I need to go to the bathroom again. Yeah. Are you hungry or anything, or...? No, I ate. I had to take a 30-minute unpaid lunch, so I went to the food court and got a burger. Oh, God. Damn, I was expecting you to, like, be off at, like, 3 or something like that. No. No, the mall is from 10 to 6. That's why I said that yesterday, kind of. I was like, we're gonna be gone all day tomorrow. That's why I told them, let's meet up yesterday instead of today, because I knew I wouldn't be off work till, like, 6. So I was like, I'm not trying to meet up, like, 7, 8, and then we're gonna be gone all night. Yeah. Ugh. Look at that. Look at the image that Google created. Yeah. Don't be weird and send that to her. She's gonna be like, why is he fucking doing weird shit with my photo? Yeah. Yeah, maybe I will not do that. That is good advice. Ugh. But yeah. Ugh, I still got two hours. Hopefully something happens in those two hours to make today productive, but I have not really been working. I've been kind of walking away from my station and sitting on my phone. I've gone to the bathroom, like, four times. I got my eyebrows done. Yeah, do you want me to bring Dagon over there so he can apply for, like, fill out one of those... Yeah, does he have a house? Yeah, he has, like, he has, like, a bunch of houses that, like, he has to, like, he's got a client that he's working for, like... No, but he can, like, still get the estimate done and then, like, you know, provide that information to the property owners. Why not? Of course it is. No, it's not. Well, yeah, but you have to own a house. You can't, like, register someone else's house. It has to be your house. You can't register somebody else to have an inspection, even if you're, like, a relative or something like that? No, the only, like, way that that kind of works is, like, let's say you're, like, my mom and, like, you lived in, like, your son's house. Like, if you lived in the house, yeah, sure, I guess, like, you're, like, a relative, like, family member. Like, you could potentially set up an appointment, but... How do they, like, like, screen for that, like, because... Because they call and then they ask. Ask who? The person that they call, like, whoever's on the fucking paper. Okay, so maybe I'll just have him do it for the place that he's actually staying at, this place that we just pulled up to. No, no, it's fine. He lives here. He lives here. Yeah, well, and who is he to the fucking actual owner? Um, well, he's the, I guess you could call him the maintenance guy or the contractor that's doing all the remodeling here, and he's also a tenant. And, uh, yeah. Yeah, no. No, because, yeah, you'd have to, like, put the, like, owner's name. That's weird. Well, I guess we could actually, maybe if you just give me a couple of the slips, I'll have the owners, the property owners actually fill out the slips themselves. That would make sense. As I'm understanding, like, all these properties that Dagan's, like, being, like, hired to work on and fix up, they're all, like, properties that are, like, pretty much being converted into group homes. Like the property that we just, the address that we just left was actually already a group home. And the one that I just pulled up to, which is, like, massive that I was telling you about. They want to make this a group home, but, like, it, like, keeps on failing inspections because, like, the windows and fire alarms and all this stuff needs to be, like, updated and remodeled. Right. Wait, I just realized after you said his name, like, for the third time, is this, like, Breeze Dagan? Yeah. Oh. Yeah, yeah, he knows you too, yeah. He's like, oh, how's it going to be? I was like... Yeah, I know. He was at our house before. I don't remember meeting him. Like, I know that, like... What do you mean you don't remember meeting him? To our house. Huh? Yeah, I mean, like, I remember she brought him over, but, like, I don't know. There's a lot going on. Yeah, I guess. So, he's sober now or what? Um... But, yeah, he's basically as sober as I am. Okay. Yeah, he doesn't, like, run around and do all the hip-dibby stuff, like, you know, whatever. Yeah. Um... Yeah, hold on. I'm going to kind of put your... I'm going to put you in my ear. Dagan!

Basically, I actually didn't clock in right when I got out of the car. And I clocked in, like, 13 minutes late, but I could still clock out, like, at 6, because I have so much time. Like, it's not going to interfere with, like, 6 hours plus 30 minutes. I got you. Okay. I'll talk to you soon, then. Okay, bye. Bye.",

I haven't even seen her face or made eye contact with her. She's like a stranger. I'm just kidding. Well, she is like a stranger, but she's like right next to me. I don't know. None of that really answers any of your questions so far. When are we getting up and coming that way? I tried calling her last night and this morning. You tried calling her? Yeah, I tried calling her last night and this morning. Yeah, I think she's like, I don't know, maybe she's like depressed or something. Shut up. Yeah, I don't know. It's weird because like I know that her phone is like always in her hands. But if she doesn't like answer your call, then I don't know, maybe if you like do something that she doesn't like you anymore. I mean, can you shut up? I'm just kidding. Can you hear me? Okay, yeah, I'm sorry. My humor is not great. I think Gaby doesn't think your humor is great. I thought it was funny. Well, thank you. Gosh, at least somebody. Yeah, you know what? I miss you, by the way. I miss you too. Yeah, gosh, I remember you. Yeah, I remember you now. Can you tell me you forgot about me? Yeah, yeah, man, I kind of forgot about you. Like, you know, we were like out partying with Vega and Victoria. And I was like, where's Ava? And I don't know, for some reason you're like, I don't know, you must have found a different disco ball or something to hang out with. No, I just stayed at home. All right. I mean, I wasn't invited. I would have gone. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess in my defense, I can't say that I fully, like, knew that's what the plan was. Like, yeah, I mean, yeah. I've been kind of busy with work lately. And then, yeah, so when I found out we were going over there, I think I found out maybe like the day of or the day before maybe. Yeah. And I thought Devin was going to be there. And then it turned out Coco was actually there. Yeah. And did you hear about all that? You called her after. I did. Oh, yeah, that's right. We talked through that right afterwards. Yeah. Hey, I'm going to call you on Snapchat. I want to see you. Oh, okay. Well, it's kind of dark in here, but sure. Then turn the light on. Okay.",

Um, my alarm's gonna go off in three minutes to get up and start getting ready. So I'll probably leave here in like an hour. I have to wake up Ashton, make sure to clean up your room a little bit, and then I have to go in there with a fucking trash bag and throw all your clothes in a bag. You need anything else? Yes. I think I just want like the rest of my clothes. Loki, yeah, that's Loki all I need right now. My clothes. I don't particularly know where I'm gonna put them all, but. Are you excited to start school tomorrow? Oh, not particularly. I don't know my schedule or teachers or anything. Oh, actually, that was one of my questions. Did you ever get an email from the school saying like, like giving me a schedule or something like that, like a follow up? So, I mean, I remember there was a phone call that took place like, like last week, like a week ago, probably like a little over a week ago now. And the lady was like, yeah, we need to know when can you guys come in? And so, yeah, I think you guys were supposed to go in at some point. I don't know. I think I I think I ended up like three way calling you or three way calling mom and got her on the phone. So she like had to figure out a time like on the spot. And I don't think I didn't like put that time in my calendar. So I don't know when the day was. Yeah, I was actually going to ask you if you guys ever made it to that appointment or if that appointment's like, I don't know, still coming up or something. I'm pretty sure it's still coming up. I'm pretty sure it's tomorrow at like 830. Yeah, let me check. Maybe I did put it in my phone or something. Oh, yeah. Well, actually, no, I just I just have a first day. But I don't know, it actually does say it's in there twice. So it says 830. And then it's got Deanna. Yeah. Did you even look at the did you even look at like the thing on your on your calendar? On your calendar? I might open it up once. Now I'm looking at this, I remember I put a bunch of information in this calendar and it's like jam-packed full of information. It says it's in there like five times. Jesus. Are you reading the description or whatever? I'm reading it. Read it out loud so I know that you're reading it. I just broke my back. Okay, sorry. I'm blocking. Okay, so there's like five of them here. It says Ava school first day at John Marshall High School. And then Ava school first day, John Marshall High School. And then Ava first day, John Marshall High School. And then Ava first day, John Marshall. And you don't have one that has like a big-ass long description? I'm looking at it right now. Well, read that shit. Ava is officially enrolled at John Marshall High School and can begin school on January 5th, 2026. Their student ID is 1034889. We're so excited for you to start this journey with us. We believe that a strong partnership between our school and our families is key to successful enriching educational experience. So we work hard to build a stronger sense of belonging. We're also committed to providing a safe, supportive, and engaging environment where every student can thrive. In the coming days, you can expect to hear from your school, John Marshall High School, with MomSuck, specific information regarding class schedules, student or teacher assignments, and important upcoming updates. Huh, interesting. Huh, that's weird. It's almost like I've seen some like subliminal messaging in that messages. Like, you didn't catch on to that at all? I can't see. I said there was some subliminal messaging in that. You're so funny, you didn't even read it. You just read it out loud and you're like, dads are better, moms suck. Yeah, I know. I knew that wasn't actually in the email and you just put that on there to like say something. Prove a point. Oh, so you did notice that? That's okay, I got the point. Yeah, I was kind of hoping that mom was going to like maybe read it and if she did, she's going to be like, what the fuck? Yeah, Loki, that probably would have been her reaction. Yeah, but um, something that I guess this email, I mean, this thing is helpful. This thing is helpful, but still, I kind of remember them like giving us an actual but I don't think I recorded that because I don't think I was like busy when that phone call happened. Great. Yeah, I don't know, that's all I got for that for now. Really? I figured he would have gotten like some type of email or something. Oh my god, I suppose I mean I could check my email just to kind of see if like something did come through. What's it called? I'll just type your name, maybe that'll come up if something does come up. Google unsubscription. Something, something. You ain't got no chia pet, pussy. I hope Gabby gets that reference. Is Gabby next to you right now? No, no, no, she's not. Yeah, you ain't got no chia pet, pussy. Yes, I'm familiar with that. Yes, I'm familiar with that. 1219. Now this is still just the email. I don't know, maybe if I go into my phone log, my phone log, it will tell me the last time I um, let's see, last time I talked to Kiana. Uh, not going anywhere. Is that just what like goes through your mind? What? Gabby calls you, I'm not going anywhere. Right, yeah. I'm not going nowhere. You guys are telling me Ashton's still asleep. A blue song. I can hear that little baby crying. Yeah, no, it sounds like, uh, it's super hectic out there. Okay, all right, I just went all the way back to my, what? No, what about Ava, maybe I was talking to Ava and that's when the call came through. December 19th, 33 minutes. Well, it didn't transcribe this call, but I don't know, I can look at, wait, other calls, Ella. Uh, I don't know if that's the one. You did not call Ella. I don't know, I can look at, I can like look at one of my phone calls, but I don't know, I can look at, I can like look at one of my phone calls, but I don't know, ask mom, because mom, why doesn't mom know? I think mom knows that we just need to be at the school at like 8 30 tomorrow. Yeah. Right, okay. Yeah, they're all crying and shit. I have no idea what's going on. I should probably go. Yeah, I'll call you back. I don't know when we're coming out there, but it's probably good. God, you said like an hour. Yeah. Okay, all right, I'll let me give you a call back.

    "transcript": "Hey Antoine, how you doing? This is Brandon Gillis. Hey, how you doing? I'm doing okay. Did I catch you at a bad time? This is who? Brandon. We don't talk often, but you sold me a 2007 Chevy GM, Chevy fucking Suburban like, I don't know, like three years ago. Oh, yeah. Hey, how you doing? How are you? How are you? I've been good. Yeah, I've been good. I've been great. I actually just retired the Chevy just recently, unfortunately. Okay, what happened? The training went out, which is typically not a big deal for me because I could just replace it myself. But like, the first training that I got that was supposed to be rebuilt, like, it wasn't actually rebuilt. So I ended up having to get a second one and that one was like messed up. And so I just like, yeah, but my baby mama, my partner or whatever, Gabby, I remember I hit you up a couple months ago, or I don't know, probably close to a year ago when she wanted to get a new car. Right. And she ended up getting a car like, and I wasn't like with her that day. And, and I don't know, I wish we would have gotten with a better choice. But I think that we're actually kind of looking at trading this vehicle in that we have now of hers. And for like, like kind of a more of a third row seat sort of thing, something that's got E85 gas. Okay, what year is the car that you got? What year do I got now? Yeah. This is a 2016 Chevy Trax. Yeah, and it's got 107,000 miles on it. How much does she pay for it? I think she paid 14 for 12 or 14, 13, 13. Thousand, of course. And how much do you want for it? Well, I don't know. I've seen, I don't know. I was looking, we were looking at on car hop. And like, basically the vehicle that we wanted to get in is like, they're trying to sell it like a 2011 or 2013 GMC Denali XL for like 14 or 15 grand. And that's like crazy because, you know, you sold me like that 2008 for like, I don't know, like a little over five or something like that. And I mean, obviously it seems like going through you would be like a way better deal because we're just looking to get like something that's like better than. Right now I have a 2016 GMC Arcadia Denali with 130,000 miles on it. I don't know if you guys are looking to finance, but unfortunately that trade on that tracks, that'll kind of be hard for me because the value of those things you're definitely not going to get. And you're probably in a loan, right? Or say the last part again. Are you guys in a loan with it? Yeah. Yeah, we are. Yeah. She put a bunch of money down towards it. Like how much do you got left on this loan anyways? You know, 5,000. Yeah. So we got a bunch of equity into it already. Are you guys looking to finance again? Yeah. I mean, yeah, basically, like I was explaining to her, it basically would be a trade in this vehicle. And then probably like, um, you know, doing like monthly pay, like still, it'd be like still paying the monthly payment for this vehicle. So, man, then what's that? Um, I would pay that off and sell it out. And this is just me being a good guy, bro. Because if you bring that tracks to me, I'm not going to give you what it's worth. And if you owe 5,000 on it, I would just pay it off and sell it and then get a new loan. Yeah, because if you look at it, like, I will. Sorry, give me one second. Yeah. Thank you. Um, you know, a Yukon and a Denali and an Acadia are two different models, though, right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. You said you had a GMC Acadia or a third row. I didn't know. That's what you said. You want a new, a newer Denali, basically. Yeah. Denali or a Chevy or something like that. Or even if I don't, I'm. I don't know. Just based on my experience, like, I'm kind of trying to lean her towards something like that's got E85 and a third row. So, I mean, anything that has those two, like, features is like. Right. So, the Arcadia has the E85 and a third row. It's the new. It's the new. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a 2016. Yeah. Denali. Acadia. Denali. I didn't know that that was a model. That sounded like two different models, but. Yeah. It's GMC Arcadia. It's the Denali version. It's just like. Okay. You know what I'm saying? How much are you trying to get rid of that one for? I can give you a good deal. Probably like. They're going for like 11, 10, 10, 11. I can probably give it to you for like 9, 5 or 8, 9. Somewhere in there. 8, 5, 9, 5. Yeah. Somewhere in there. Going for 11. 11, 12. Yeah. What was the last thing you said? She was saying something. Yeah, they're going for 11, 12. Okay. Going for like 11, 12. Okay. And then. And when. Are you. Are you going to be getting anything new in the next? Like, I don't know 30 or 60 days. If you tell me you want a. Like, I don't know how you guys are financing. But you want, what year do you want? I mean, I mean, we're cool with anything from like 2010 and up. But yeah, mainly like, yeah, those two, those two features, like the third row and like the 85. It's got those two things like we're interested in whatever it is. OK, so if you give me to this week, I can get you one for sure. I mean, preferably, yeah, that'd be nice, but. But and then I know that she, like, so it's the first of the month kind of right now. And towards the middle of the month is when she gets like kind of a bigger paycheck. And if we were going to, I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Because we're at the finance and basically get rid of this vehicle. I don't know how the fuck I know there's like a million ways to do the transaction. I mean, really, like, I don't know if we're working with this company, but. I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if there's any other way to do it. But I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Really, like, I don't know if we're working with you. Well, honestly, take, like, your best advice. And let me. Once you do this, send me a van and I'll see how much is worth and what I can do for you. I could do that. I'll text you now. We can go from there. I'm going to hit you tomorrow. All right.

I apologize. You know, I'm one of the last times I well, when I was in town last, I had mentioned and I don't I don't blame you if you don't remember or because we all had like a bunch of stuff going on. And I wasn't able to meet with you when I got in came in and out last anyway. But I was going to I was trying to explain that my my office in Minneapolis, they said that because of like this, like their goals out in the same cloud area, they wanted me to like only work out in like the same cloud area, like for now, for now on, like they only wanted to take clients out of St. Cloud and out of Mora. So I have to all my all my clients in Minneapolis, I have to transfer to other people. And and when I met with you, my plan was when I met with going to be when I met with you was to like kind of, you know, explain that all to you, like and kind of introduce you to this person, Bella. And because we weren't able to meet up and my and my plan for that day, like kind of just went to shit like right away. Yeah, I was only able to like actually meet with Bella over the phone and kind of like tell her about like working with you and and. And yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's kind of getting you caught up a little bit, but what are your thoughts? Thank you. Oh, well, I mean, it sucks because like, you know, I feel like I mean, it bums me out that I'm not going to be able to like work with you because like, I don't know, that was kind of like my my way of being able to hang out with you more because, you know, you're near and dear to me, obviously. So I'm a little frustrated that I'm not going to be able to go out to Minneapolis as much as I'd like anymore or whatever. But and but I do think that, like, I mean, I told her that you were naturally pretty shy and that, yeah, I don't know, I didn't tell her a little bit about you. And like, obviously. Actually, I did tell her some personal stuff like that because of the goals that we were working on together that I wrote down. You remember? Yeah. So I mean, she has access to all those notes. And basically, she knows that those notes that we those goals that we wrote down, like, I don't know, three months ago, they're all like about to expire. So, okay. Yeah. Oh, yeah. So, um, I don't know, yeah, I just kind of wanted to, like, try to facilitate and, like, I don't know, make sure that you were comfortable with this person, or I don't know, because I really, it would really bum me out, honestly, if, you know, if me and you weren't working together, if it would bum me out, if you didn't, like, I don't know, work with somebody else, you know? Okay. I mean, how do you feel? I mean, this is all about what your thoughts are. I mean, it's okay. You have to do what you do, right? Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, but I mean, I know you got like, like, you got Zeke, and you got like everything else going on. And I did kind of tell her that, like, you know, you know, her boyfriend Zeke, you know, he just got out of prison or jail, you know, within the last, like, two or three months. And so right now, Zeke's kind of like most important thing in her life right now. And I may have worded it a little bit differently than that. But um, yeah, I don't know. Are you? Are you okay with working with her? Or do you want me to like, find you like a guy to work with? Or I don't know, do you ever chance to really talk to her? No, she just called me just now and I was just so I was a little confused. Yeah. You want you want me to like three way caller or something like that? So we can talk together. I mean, sure. No, I'm, I'm in the I'm in a car. I'm a passenger in a car right now. Okay. So I see that actually, she did just message me. I'm gonna, I'm gonna call her right now.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, um, I had the, uh, you guys be able to work together, I mean, um, and I, I don't know if, um, I think, I think it's a, I think one of the two scenarios I was kind of told about this is, like, I think that you, you'd be her primary from now on, and if something ever, like, were to come up, like, a late night emergency, or some sort of, like, weird situation, I could still, um, you know, uh, act as her secondary person, like, I don't know, I'm pretty sure, uh, that's, like, how the office refers to how all that works, I think, but I'll be here if you need me, need me, but, um, yeah, and I know I do, I can say that, um, because I went on leave for, like, a while, I was, like, on leave for almost, like, two months, so a lot of her, uh, notes in, uh, on, on our program, or whatever, as, like, they're basically about to, like, all expire, so, um, we have worked on a lot of things, and accomplished some great things so far, but mainly, like, to do with her insurance, and getting, like, certain appointments going, um, but yeah, uh, for sure, for sure, I know one of them was, like, um, basically getting a new assessment for her, I wanted to schedule that with you, um, if you have time sometime this week, um, I'll figure out the times, and reach out to you, if that's okay, Cassandra, I'll be able to transfer you to get that done. Okay, yeah, so you mentioned, you mean, like, she has to do a new CD assessment, like, with Tyson, or something? Yeah, that was, yeah, I think I asked you that when I was speaking with you, um, and without, well, I don't know, I'm pretty sure, I can't really fully remember how long those are good for, but I feel like we just did hers. Oh, okay, then we're good, then. Yeah, yeah, as far as that goes. Yeah, her insurance and all that should be good, yeah, and, um, but I think it's, uh, yeah, basically, if you get, once you guys are able to sit down, I know that Cassie's got, like, I was able to meet with her, like, three times a week, basically, and, um, once you guys sit down, and kind of start figuring stuff out, you'll kind of, yeah, it'll be, it'll all come natural, but, okay, yeah, I, so, Cassie, I trust Bella, and you can totally trust her, as well. Okay, okay, well, um, if you guys have any questions, or if there's anything I can do, I'll let you, I'll leave you guys to it, and, uh, Cassie, hopefully, I'll get to, you know, meet up with you, uh, sometime in the near future, and just kind of see how you're doing. Hey, actually, I'm so sorry, before I get off the phone, I wanted to ask you something that I haven't had a chance to yet, but, and, on, in the end of October, were you able to go to your son's birthday party? Yep. And how did that go? Shitty. Oh, it didn't go as well, or it was kind of traumatic? Yes. Oh, man, I'm sorry. Um, my, he, like, he seen me, but, like, I don't know, since my stepdad was standing next to him, he didn't really do anything, but he, it just felt like he, like, looked over me, and, like, you know, just, like, passed me. Yeah. Were you not there? As if, like, he didn't know who I was. Were you not there for very long, or what? I was there the whole time. I mean, except for, I mean, my grandparents and I left a little early, but not, like, a half hour early or whatever, because they were eating and stuff, so, like, we're like, okay, we'll just take off. Oh, really? So you didn't really get to interact with them much at all? Um, no, not really. I mean, he was busy. They were bowling and stuff. Oh, I see. But I was supposed to go as auntie, remember? Right, right. Were you able to, like, kind of talk with your mom and your stepdad a little bit to kind of? No, my mom didn't even see, I don't know, my mom, she was so standoffish, and it was just, it was, the whole thing was just fucked up. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry that it didn't go as well as we had hoped. Um, I don't know, maybe there's an opportunity to, I don't know, get your foot in the door somewhere, like we were discussing, because, I don't know, I know that that's a big deal. Right. Yeah. I hope so. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give you a call again sometime soon and kind of check in. But I'll let you guys go on. And I hope you guys enjoy your Sunday. What do you, what do you got going on the rest of this Bella? Um, to be honest, I was like, just trying to reach out to all my people, you know, try to schedule something for next week. That way, I didn't receive services. I'm just like, my brother passed away. So I'm like, just coping with that right now, too. I'm really sorry to hear that. Yeah, it's been like a crazy New Year's, Brendan and Cassandra's just like being whoop. We got to stay in recovery, got to stay positive and feed ourselves. Exactly. And I'm really sorry to hear that. And it just happened like within the last few days or? Yeah, I was actually at a meeting yesterday. And afterwards, my father called me and was like, you know, my father's in out of the country. And he was like, Yeah, your brother passed away. I'm on my way to Minnesota. So got to get ready for burial. We're doing an autopsy to see if he died from substance use. Once we received the autopsy tonight, we should all be over there within the next two days. Yeah. So he was I'm so sorry. Yeah, that's really rough. I'm sorry. I can totally. Yeah, I feel for you. It seems like we lose a lot of people. I've lost two people recently that were I just had to talk to my supervisor about it to kind of get my mind right. Yeah, if there's anything I can do to help, by all means, I'm sorry for your loss. Yeah, definitely. Y'all should kind of just stay in there, you know, my sobriety, stay positive and honor him that way, you know. So yeah, most of my family members, you know, like, it's a taboo in my community. So it's like being a great example to stay in sobriety. Yeah. How long have you been sober now? I've been sober for like about three years now, going on four. Okay. Yeah, mostly on mostly go to like meetings on, you know, do charity work on the weekends. I do like a sobriety bowling on the third Saturday and third Friday. And just like have fun. I try to get myself busy, you know, try to get myself busy. But then again, some self-care too, you know, like, because you can have fun in recovery, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'll be a beacon of hope. Definitely. That's one of the things I love about this job is like some, sometimes like, I can work with somebody and like go fishing at the same time. Like, I haven't actually done that yet. But I plan to. I don't know. Yeah, go. Yeah, I just got a membership at 2218. And like, they have a gym membership gym in there. It's like $15 per month to pledge and have like a membership at the I don't know club. So like I have they have like the pool room you have accessible to the game room. You have access to like on basically the gym just for $15 a month. So I pay for extra $15 to bring some peers up there. So it's really nice. You can really have fun though. Whatever that is to you. Yes, okay. What did you say Cassie? I said I love having fun. You love having fun? I'm kidding her. Well, I'm the CPRS for you then, Cassie. Yes. Are you? Are you in Minneapolis? Yeah. Um, I'm in South Minneapolis. Where are you? North side. North side. Are you familiar with Willard? Willard? Yes, very much so. You can do karaoke on Friday. They do. Yeah, they do karaoke on Friday. Yeah, that'd be awesome. I from what I've known, I've known Cassie for so long. And I would be super amazed if you were able to get her to go out and get out of her shell like that. I'm meeting all the time. But karaoke, that's that's like, No, they just started doing that. I'm serious. They never, I don't think they did that before. Yeah, I did karaoke on New Year's. Yeah, it's a whole new thing. Yeah, I just did karaoke on New Year's. That's crazy. And then generational hope goes wrong every fourth Sunday. Say that again. Generational hope we do a rolling every fourth Sunday now. Every fourth Sunday. Nice. Yeah. What's that place called? Memory Lane. Memory Lane. Okay, I'm gonna put that in my calendar. It's it's at um, it's at okay, so do you know where the Cup Food on Hiawatha is? Yep. It's literally behind the Cup Food on Hiawatha. If you go towards 26th Street, it's that Bowling Palace. Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, um, I would like to schedule something with you. When can we meet? Um. Anything? Except for the 9th and 9th, I have Courtney. Okay, so we can meet like tomorrow afternoon. Oh, yeah. Go get a cup of coffee. Are you busy today? Huh? Tuesday? Tuesday works. Okay, yeah, let's do Tuesday. Okay, um, Tuesday, what time works for you? Any time. Any time. Okay, so let's shoot. Are you an early person? Like are you? No, not really. Thank you for your honesty. Um, so let's do like around noon or like noon or 1 p.m. Which one works better for you? Uh, let's go with 1. 1 o'clock. Where would I be picking you up from? Um. That I'm not entirely sure. Usually she's kind of like, uh, like, either Benson Avenue, she, she stays at her grandparents' place. And then, um, the other place she stays is on Broadway, like in Emerson. Yeah, but sorry, I don't know why I'm speaking for her. No, that's okay. We've actually been friends for like, like, I was friends with Cassie before, like, I became a CPRS. And she's actually a big motivation. Yeah, yeah. Oh, that's so cool. That's so amazing. Yeah, you're her hope shop. She's like one of, she's like my emotional support person. And because she was really there for me in some of my really low times. So I got, I definitely got a soft spot for her. And we, I don't know, we can kind of be goofy together. Like, I'm like socially awkward, and she's a little socially awkward. And we kind of, we kind of like, I don't know. We just go with it. Yeah. Wherever you want to meet, like we can meet, I can just call you then on Monday at 1pm, 12 o'clock, if that's okay. And you can just send me the address then. Okay, yeah, you mean Tuesday, right? Yeah, Tuesday, Tuesday. I have it on my calendar for January 6. I don't know why I said Monday, Cassie. I don't know. That's okay. Yeah, Tuesday. Yeah, and then we'll go from there. Yeah. Yeah, one of the things I always found helpful is like, if I'm going to get a, if Cass is available, I'll like, I'll message her, like, and or call her, like, when I'm still on the road in the beginning of my day. And like, if she's, like, gonna be, if I'm gonna be able to meet with her, she'll answer the phone. But if she doesn't answer, then I kind of already know that it's not gonna work out. For that day. Yeah, definitely, definitely. I was like, man, let me just call these people, you know, like, because they're just not receiving services. But I appreciate you, Cassie. And Cassandra, I don't know which one you prefer, my bad. Cassandra. Cassie, okay. I'll call you Cassie. And then we can just go from there. And then say, lock my number in. And like, if you need additional support, you're like, hey, man, just utilize me. Because this is what I'm here to do, right? Provide support for you and stop hope, right? Like, hey, Bella, I need this. Can you show up for me? Like, if you need to go, like, go grocery shopping, or you need to go see your doctor, just keep in contact with me. I'm here for you. And I appreciate you. Okay. Hey, one last thing. I was gonna ask, like, just, is it still, do I still have your permission, Cassie? Like, if I have, like, notes or something, can I share those notes with Bella? If it's, like, I mean, basically your business? Yeah, can I send that stuff over to her? Okay. Okay, I just wanted to make sure. Okay, well, I'll let you guys get going and try to enjoy your Sundays. And I'll see you on Tuesday. Thank you, Brandon. Yeah. All right, bye.",

    "transcript": "Other calls: Mary Z Mom @ 11m 38s I was like going to save that fella chick's name in my contacts and as soon as I copied her name, her name came up like a Google search term basically without me actually trying to and I'm going to show you this little video, check that video out, I guess you can kind of get to know her because I guess she's a speaker on this thing, I don't know, yeah, all right, sorry, I just wanted to show you that, this is me sharing secret information with you. Okay. So you can get an idea of who she is, like a dossier, I don't know, nevermind. Okay, weirdo. Yeah, because I, it's only fair, I guess, because I'm going to be doing basically the same thing with her to you, to you, you know what I mean? So yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. How have you been? I mean, you're talking. Okay. Yeah. I need to come down. Like, I'm technically I'm in the cities right now, but I'm passing through, but I do need to fucking come through and meet up with Zach, because when I've seen him last, what? So you know it was me who answered your phone last night, right? Say that again? I know that was you that answered. I think that you answered his phone. Yeah, I really, yeah, I understand that. Okay. So, well, his phone and everything else that was with him is here, so. He went to the store, and he'd be right back, but he hasn't been back. What store? Literally, like, well, he was going to go get, like, chips and something to drink or whatever, and yeah, hasn't been back. This was, like, what, like, last night at, like, I don't know, seven, eight? It was just before, it was, he left just before you called, or just after you, no, you called after he had left. There we go. Does he have, like, his second phone, the one that doesn't have service? Does he have that one on him? I have not a clue. I just know I have the one that works, is here, but it's dead, and his wallet, dog food, jacket, everything. I don't know, I guess I could, if I can check. I know, I was going to call his mom and see if he'd show up there. I mean, that's not, I mean, this is kind of what I'm thinking, like, he, I'm guessing that he probably would have, like, maybe there was something going on, or he wanted to go back to the mom's house for some reason, and maybe check on them. Right. I don't know how he is. He's like, that's the dog food here. But he didn't leave the dog, though. No. I mean, well, I can, have you tried calling his mom? No, not yet. I just said I was going to call her and see if he maybe showed up over there. He'd probably be doing him a solid if he, like, plugged his phone in while you had it. Oh, yeah, probably. Yeah. Yeah, man, that guy is so fucking dumb sometimes. Yeah, like, he was going to bring back, like, chips for Zeke, and he was going to bring them back for Mandu and some for Tee, and, like, he just hasn't been back. Yeah. It's just, it's weird. That is a little weird. Yeah. I mean, he must have went to his mom's, because, like, otherwise, like, somebody would have fucking seen him by now, and that's the only other place he's going to go. Right. So I'm sure his, like, weed or stuff, whatever is in his coat or his backpack, because his backpack is here, too. Like, and I'm sure, like, his weed and all of that is here. Yeah. And you know he never, usually ever leaves without that. Yeah, I mean, I guess I, I guess, well, I, right after, I could look him up, look up, see if, like, we had picked him up for something, because he does have active warrants, I think. Oh, fuck. Yeah, let me, is it in Brooklyn Park? Like, that area is still considered Anoka County? Yeah. Anoka County Jail Rancer. Huh? Yeah, that's the Anoka County Jail Rancer. Yeah. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. It's not in Anoka County. Okay, hold on one second. Okay. Can you hold on? Hmm? Huh? Hmm? Can you hold on? Are you talking to me? No, I'm talking to you. Okay. It's off or on? Off. Do you have an interest in it? No. Okay, hold on. I need to use your Google. Do you have to look something up? Because mine is clearly just sitting like this. Let me see. There. Warming. Okay. Oh shit. Hold on a second. October 23rd? Yeah. That's a while ago, so he's not interested right now in Hennepin County. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to put you on a brief hold. All right. Okay. Is his mom's name fucking Mary? Yeah. How do you spell his last name? S-H-E-E-H-Y. Okay. Dude, I know that he got his mom's fucking name saved, but... Well, he's not in jail. Yeah, he's not in Hennepin County or in Oakwood County. Well, he's not in any county other than Wyoming. But normally he would, like, ask somebody... Hm? If they could... If they... He would ask somebody that we know if they could get a hold of Arnold. Sure. Sure. Yeah, he's used to calling me after Arnold. Sure. Do you have Zach's mom's phone number? Yeah. Oh. Oh, can you tell me where it is, Lori? Yep. Okay, I'm starting to use that. 612. 643. 643. Oh, 3365? 3365, yeah. Oh, yeah. It did come up. Okay. I'm calling right now. Hello? Hey, Mary. How's it going? This is Brandon Gillis. This is who? Brandon. I'm one of Zach's CPRS. We've met a couple of times. Yep. I was actually... I have somebody on the phone with me. Cassie. I don't know if you're familiar with her either. We're kind of just concerned a little bit. Have you heard from Zach at all in the last, like, 12 hours or so? Yeah. Oh, you have? Yeah. Okay. Is he with you or something? Or did you see him or something? Yeah, he's here now. Okay. Okie dokie. We were just kind of double-checking and making sure. Because, yeah, as far... I just checked in with somebody. Well, I checked in with Cassie, who's on the phone right now. And she told me that, like, when I tried to get a hold of him last night, she had his phone and then he was, like, left. And he was supposed to come right back. And he didn't, like, doesn't, like, have most of his stuff or his phone. So we were just a little concerned that something bad might have happened to him. No, he's okay. Yeah. No, he's okay. Okay. That's good. Well, I'm glad to hear that. How are you doing? I'm okay. Okay. Sarah, I know I say this probably every time I do get you on the phone, but maybe you should save my phone number in case there's, like, anything, anytime you ever need to get a hold of me. I know you don't really know me that well, but I don't know. I'm one of those people that kind of just help with things. And I don't know. Okay. But, well, thank you. Thank you for letting me know. Yeah, just when you do talk to Zach or when he wakes up, just let him know that Cassie's got his phone and his dog food and whatever. Okay, I will. All right. Thank you. You have a nice day. You too. Bye. Bye. Hey, sorry about that. I got her on the phone. Yeah. And then, I don't know, the swap thing. But, yeah, he is over there. Okay, good. Yeah. That's good. She really likes him. Yeah. She really needs to save my number because every time I call her, she's like, who is this? I'm like, bro, we have this conversation every time. Okay. Yeah, normally he would have taken his mom's phone and fucking called. I know. Yeah, I assume maybe he's fucking just sleeping or something like that. I think he sounds like he's sleeping right now. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, no problem. Well, I'm going to hit you up soon. And I'm also kind of curious how Zeke's doing too. Like, I want to come and get out of here. I want to help him with his car. Okay. So, yeah, yeah. All right, I'll talk to you guys soon. Otherwise, you don't have to call me. Okay. All right, talk to you soon. All right, talk to you soon.

    "transcript": "Hello. Hello. Hi. So the girls, Ella and Ashton, just summoned me to my room, to my own room, to have a conversation. And they basically were in here without my permission, and my weed pen is on my nightstand, and they're like, Ella's crying, Ashton, they're both telling me how hypocritical I am and that I'm setting such a bad example, and I'm like, listen, for one, I'm an adult, for two, it's legal. They're literally acting like they just caught me shooting up in my room or something. So let me ask you an initial question. You have been without your thyroid medicine for an X amount of time, is that right? No, my antidepressant. Okay. So they can fucking eat a dick, it's none of your business to judge you or ask you questions about what your intentions are, because for one, you're an adult. That's what I told them, but they're like, now you're just not hearing me and blah, blah, blah. And they're acting like... Honestly, I mean, I understand that because of your med situation, had you not had a med issue right now, I would probably be a little judgy too about why you're doing that, what's fucking going on in your life. But I understand, and yeah, honestly, I shut the girls' dad off because I think that they're just way too fucking wild, way too kind of fucking disrespectful, and I don't know, I think they should just fucking have the basics for a while. But to fully implement that plan, that would imply that you should change the pattern of your Wi-Fi and make it so they only get Wi-Fi from the TVs. But yeah, I get it, it's your house, obviously. That conversation did not go well, they both just left, like, stormed out of my room. Good. I mean, fucking, honestly... I told them, I was like, I've told you guys before, I'm like, the problem isn't with you guys smoking weed itself, I'm like, but you guys are kids and you're not, like, you're still developing. I'm like, I'm not doing anything illegal, I'm not doing anything wrong, I'm like, I'm an adult. Like, if when you're an adult, if you choose to do or not to do it, like, that's on you, but yeah. Gabby said something earlier this week, and I'm not like, really fully with it, but Gabby's like, you know, I guess the big thing is like, if their behavior, if they were to like, get straight A's, like, be excelling in all areas of life, like, I wouldn't care if they smoked weed. And that's what she said. But, and I had to kind of like, I don't know, it was kind of just wild to hear somebody say that. I'm like, you would smoke fucking weed with my kids, you would smoke weed with Ashton. She's like, yeah, I'd smoke a fat blunt with her. And I was like, although I don't ever really like, fucking say that anybody should take advice from Gabby, but I don't know, I guess it is worth fucking kind of saying like, honestly, if they were to behave like adults, I would give them more adult fucking, you know, amenities and respects and shit like that. But if they're not fucking like sailing through life, and they're kind of being disrespectful, breaking rules, fucking testing the water, fucking being, I don't know, just honestly, like failing classes doing just, they're not fucking absolutely perfect kids, then I feel like they need to like, be brought back down to like, the Amish lifestyle or humbled a little bit. Yeah. But I don't know, I'm not really hearing a whole bunch of like, yes, I believe the same thing sort of thing on your on your side of the phone, so I'm just gonna shut up for a little bit. No, I mean, honestly, I like I don't completely disagree with that. But it's crazy to me that they just like came in here to like, have like an intervention with me. I mean, kudos to them for like, I mean, approaching you about something that was on their mind. But today, like, I mean, if they like this, except what you just told them just now, that's kind of disrespectful in itself. And I was like, I won't do it around you guys, whatever. And they're like, Well, no, it's just the fact that we even know that you're doing it now. And I'm like, Okay, I'm like, so then in the conversation, I was like, No, if it's this serious to you guys, like, I won't do it. It's not that big of a deal. But then they just got up and walked away. And like, whatever. I'm confused. What happened? Um, fucking Kiana has been smoking, like using a weed pen. Yeah. And I kind of had, like, my weird suspicions, but then I said it out loud, but then she kind of like, when we got back to the house, she's, she like confirmed that I was basically was dry snitching her and not really knowing it. And then she said that the girls found her weed pen and like, if I can give her like the same degree that like, like, you're like, you're no in no position or no sort of role model. I'm saying that I'm a hypocrite about it. And that I'm setting a bad example. Yeah. Yeah. See? Like I said, we're adults, we make money, like, it's us, I'm like, if you were fucking grades, and you were like, fucking valedictorian, valedictorian of your fucking class, maybe you would smoke weed too. Right. Yeah, they didn't. They didn't like my response that I'm an adult, and I'm allowed to do that if I want to, it's legal, blah, blah. And they're, yeah, they're not happy with that. So. I mean, yeah, honestly, I really wouldn't like if you fucking did the whole no wifi thing, because it's gonna like, give, it's gonna incentivize them to like, want to like, be better behavior. And like, because if they, if in their mind, they're like, okay, if we fucking do what mom and dad want, then like, maybe they'll give us the fucking wifi back like normal. And like, honestly, I don't I don't fucking really have any intention of giving it back. I don't think you should either. Yeah. They have a cell phone text and phone numbers. And that's like an essential feature that I'd like them to have. But I mean, flip phones is like, I mean, this is the same concept as a flip phone. It's taking away the data. Right. Yeah. Not even lightning. Yeah. Oh, shit. Sorry. I'm Milo. I just kicked the cat in the face. I'm getting water. No, I'm not. But okay. Whatever. I'm going to bed. But okay. Well, good talk. We'll continue this conversation later. I'm gonna I gotta get ready for bed. I have to get all the kids to school in the morning. I don't want to be up late. your definition of between the two, Brandon. I mean, like, if you were doing something for recreational, it would kind of imply that, like, there's something like you feel is missing in your life that you need to do that. That's not the case. I mean, like, if you were doing something for recreational, it would kind of imply that, like, there's something like you feel is missing in your life that you need to do that. That's not the case. I mean, that's what recreational means. Right, I never said that it was, though you did. You asked me what the difference between the two are. No, I meant, like, how are you differentiating? Because you said it sounds like I am doing it more recreationally. I don't know. I guess I just assumed that you wouldn't be as, like, defensive if it was, it was like, not just that. Defensive to who? The kids? I don't know. No, it was just, like, the way they came out, it was, like, a little crazy. And then they started, like, getting more angry. I'm like, wait, what the fuck? Why are we mad right now? I just didn't think it was that serious, but apparently I'm the worst person ever now. Well, it's not your job to be their friend sometimes. Yeah, I know. All right, well, I'm going to go, though. I will talk to you guys later. Okie dokie. All right, thanks for helping with that stuff tonight. Yeah, dude, that's crazy. All right, bye. All right, bye.",

How may I help you, sir? Hey, good morning. This is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Great, and you? I'm doing well. So, the reason I was calling today, I was filing, I was prepared, I think it was like 2022 or 23, and I was filing it, like, late. And I understand in order for me to do that myself, it needs to be submitted by mail. And I don't know if that's accurate because I haven't talked to you guys for a long time, but it's been, I don't know, probably close to four or five months now since I filed it by certified mail, and I never got any notification that you guys received it. And then I checked on the IRS.gov to see if you guys received it by mail. And I'm kind of beginning to think you guys, I might have put the wrong address or something. So, I don't know. I was going to try to follow up with that and maybe get the correct address. Okay. Yeah, let's take a look at your account here. May I have your date of birth, please? 12-15-86. All right. And what's your complete mailing address? 130 Forest Avenue West, Mora, Minnesota, and that is 55051. All right. And then can I just verify your phone number as well while you have me on the line? It's 320-775-9130. All right. Thank you. So, you said about four months ago you filed your federal return. Did you send in your state return as well, or are you just going about your federal return? Yeah, yeah. I filed it together, so yes. Okay. So, the federal return goes to the IRS. The state return goes to the states. Did you send in two separate copies? No, I did not. I don't know. I'm kind of suspicious that the address that I sent it to may have not been the official or the right address, because I think it had me send it to someplace out of state. Okay. Right. So, I mean, I'm not sure where the federal return goes, but I can tell you the state return does not go out of state. It would come to Minnesota. Okay. If you could give me that address. And also, can you confirm that if I am trying to file for a year that's as old as 2023 or 22, it's required to be received by mail, right, if I'm filing myself? No. As long as the software allows you to file online, I don't see any reason why you're not. I don't see a demand to file a letter sent or anything. So, you should be able to file online, yes. And I guess the trick is just finding a place that will file it online without a fee? Exactly. Exactly, yeah. That I can't help you with. Okay. But, yep. And then I can provide you with the address. It is going to be on the form, so you would just send a copy of the 2022 M-1 with the 1040. But I can give you that address still if you'd like. Okay, yeah. Go ahead. All right. That is Minnesota Individual Income Tax. Okay. Mail station 0010. Okay. 600 North Robert Street. All right. And that is in St. Paul, Minnesota. Okay. Zip code 55146. Okay. And that was for the state one? And then do you have the federal one as well? I don't, no. I'm sorry. Oh, really? Not sure where the federal goes here. They don't want to give me an incorrect address. Okay. And also, you said that I can do it. I can submit it electronically through, like, a certified software, but you can't actually recommend, like, a good one to do it, like, for free? Correct, yeah. We can't recommend any software to you, but, yeah, there's no reason why you wouldn't be able to file electronically. Okay. All right. All right. Okay. Well, I think that's all I got for today. Are you aware we're missing 23 and 24s as well? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think the last year you got was 21, right, or 22? 21. Yeah. Yep, 2021, yeah, the last one we received. Yep. Yeah, so I don't think I'm going to be filing one. Or maybe it was, yeah, yeah. Basically, I only have the ability to file for two years, and I think it's like 22 and 23 is what I filed for, and I haven't filed one for 24 yet. I don't actually think I'm going to be able to because my income, I didn't have any income. Yeah, I mean, it benefits you to take a look and see if you file. There may be credits that you could qualify for and such. So even if you don't meet the minimum requirements to file, at least take a look and see if you get to file, and if there's a credit it would benefit you, so. Yeah. Okay. Looking at the account, looks like there is what's called other agency debt. Yep. First aid. So any refund would go to that, yeah. Yep, yep, I understand that. Okay. And do you rent or own the home in Mora? Rent. Rent, okay. Did you get a certificate of rent paid by any chance? No, no, I. From your landlord? No, I haven't. Okay. They should be providing you with that. The rentier's credit is actually income tax credit, so you can file that with your 2024 return. Okay. And then, of course, any refund would go to that state tax, but at least I'll pay it off faster. Okay, okay. And, okay, I think that's all I got for now. I know I'm going to be having to call you guys back later on in this, like in like a week or two, to make a payment towards that specific debt on my state capture or whatever, revenue recapture or whatever or something. But I'm not prepared to do that right now, though, so. All right, I just wanted to kind of get the information I needed for submitting those taxes properly, if I was going to do it by mail again. But I think I might just pay a little bit of, pay whatever fee to submit it electronically, so I know that it gets to you guys. Right. Okay. And then, yeah, they just sent a copy of the 1040, and then you can definitely check with the IRS to see if they got your federal return. Okay. And can you provide a phone number for me to call and follow up with them? Yep. Let me know when you're ready for that. All right. Go ahead. All right. 1-800. Yep. 829. Yeah. 1040. Okay. Perfect. All right. Well, thank you. All right. All right. You have a nice day. You're welcome. All right. Bye. Thank you. You too. Any other questions for Ed in or? No, no. I don't think so. I can give you guys a call back if I do. All right. Sounds great. Thanks. Yep.",

We just met with the guidance counselor and the only thing is I have to go to one of the schools to go update the Skyward thing because I don't know. Something happened when Gabby created the account or put you guys as the main family so I don't have any access to it basically. Did they tell you to fill out a form online in order to add you to it? No, I have to go to another school that does the records to have them update it and they said they might have to contact you to okay it or something because whatever because you guys made the account. Make sure I'm not trying to steal the kids or something. Yeah, yeah. I can follow up with them and make sure of that. But they didn't make it awkward for you while you were there? No, they were nice. Alright, that's good. Yeah. I don't know. I just got a call saying that Ella was marked absent from this class but I don't know. I think she's probably just late because she if you're late for class you get marked absent while they do the attendance part you know? Yeah. I'll follow up with that. I hate that they do that. If she's late they send you an absent notification. It should be accurate because then it makes me wonder what's really going on. Right. Well yeah, so I'm just at the store right now trying to find something to wear tonight but not having much luck. Yeah. It's crazy to think that you don't have something to wear. Well, see the problem is everything that I bought this last year because when I came down here I didn't have anything and when I bought all this stuff I was bigger and I've lost weight since then so most of the stuff I bought was actually just like sweatshirts and so I have nothing cute to wear for a date. Yeah, I know. Maybe you could loan me something, Brandon? Like wear one of my hoodies or something? Yeah. No, I'm just kidding. I'm already but I'm just back from the dressing room so I will, yeah, I'll talk to you later. Dressing room? Yeah, I'm at Plato's Closet. I'm about to try on these sweaters. Let me know, so what's going on with this week? You might be coming down here? Yeah, yeah. I don't know the full details yet but they'll kind of like let me know what's kind of the understanding of what they want to do with the plan. Dude, I just realized as I've been changing that the clothes that I wore last night when I was cooking, everything smells like onions. Really? Do you even have onions in it? The green onions. The celery greens. Oh, okay. Alright, I gotta go. I'll talk to you later.",

And I'm like, so I mean, there's some like leeway, but I mean, worst case scenario, like I'll be in the area for a little bit, but worst case scenario, I just have you meet with the person that would be giving it to me. Okay. And, um, yeah. Um, I'm wondering, are you, you're coming from, you'll be driving through Oak River or Rogers? Um, no, no, actually from, because I'm in St. Cloud right now. After this, I got to go to Mora and then the cities. Because the money's in, the money's in Rogers. Oh, okay. Um, yeah. And I know you said they don't like meeting after dark. Well, five o'clock is pretty close to dark. Um, are they willing to meet me at five or after five, like around six? Yeah. Um, and she's, he's mobile and stuff and everything. Um, I think, uh, but the meeting would actually, so the transaction would actually be taking place in like Rogers. Not, not the cities. Oh, and Rogers? Yeah. That's where the transaction would happen. But pick it up. Perfect. That was a question as well. It was a question. That's perfect. Okay. Yeah, because I got to get the money in Rogers anyway. Okay. And, um, okay. And how much? Um, I'll, I'll verify. Cause I, I know that it's like 13 and, but I was going to, I'm going to verify that. And also the person that you'll be meeting with, his name is Tom. Tom? Yeah. It's not the Mexican? No, he's like a, basically a representative of the Mexicans. Yeah. No, Tom works for, for HEPA. And you trust this? Yeah, I do. I kind of have an interesting relationship with Tom, but he's, he's super trustworthy. He actually just got out of prison, like, I don't know, like maybe three or four months ago. Uh, he fucking, yeah, yeah. He's, he's in the circle, like of trust, definitely. And, um, he, uh, went to prison because, uh, he fucking, it's kind of a funny story. He's on YouTube, but he, uh, hit a cop with his, with a truck. Um. Yeah. Do you ever hear me tell, do you hear about that? Sound familiar? Oh yeah, yeah. I think I do. I do remember that. Yeah. He like, basically he was, he fell asleep in a stolen white Dodge Ram. And, uh, like a cop like went to check on him like early as fuck in the morning and like knocked on the windows, spooked him. And he like kind of just panicked. He like started the truck up and just like, like drove in between like a pole and her vehicle and fucking kind of bumped her. Oh, it was a girl. Oh. It was a female cop. Yeah. Like she basically got like clipped by the mirror and like kind of flew back like a foot or two, like into the fence and it kind of bounced right back up. It wasn't as bad as it probably sounds, but yeah, the police, police chase. And then he got away and he abandoned the truck and like a parking lot behind someplace or whatever. And he like got away, but then he, he's like, like a day later or some shit. He's like, oh man, I got to go back. Like I left like all my shit in there and everybody's like, don't go back to that. That'd be dumb as fuck to go back. And he eventually went back and they, they were fucking casing the, like watching it. And when he went in, went like walked up to the truck, they went and fucking nabbed him. And that's how the story ends. This is kind of funny though. I'm glad he is out now. And then he didn't get as long as he probably could have. Wow. That was like two, I think he was gone for like basically like two years. All right. But anyways, that's the quick story. Funny. Too bad. It sounds like I might not be able to see you in this case, but I still miss you and lust for you. And I hope you're doing good. You're funny. Yeah. I'm doing good. So I'm going to confirm the price and let Tom know that it's going to be meeting with you. Okay. Yeah. No, no, I don't want any bullshit, man. It's not. It's good. All right. Cause yeah, if this goes well, then I'll be, I'll be, I'll be getting a lot from them. Okay. And like, you don't have to like go through me or anything like that. It's like, you're, you're okay to have this information and vice versa. Okay. Yeah. But that's on the, on the terms that like Tom is a secret person. Just like, you're a secret person. It's like, I'm a secret person. Does that make sense? He's a what? Like he's a secret. Like don't tell him, don't share it. Yeah. Don't introduce him to anybody else. Okay. All right. All right.

Both kids are on the lay down. Yeah. I was helping baby with like his fucking issues and then fucking and then homeboy the other guy. I mentioned I got my boys with me at the moment. And although I don't have really any free time to really kick it or anything, I was going to stop by and say hi before you left. Well, I might not have to run to Rogers first. I'm going to have to I'm going to I think I'm just going to pay for it myself and then the money later. That would be a barrier. Yeah, because I got it right out there anyway to drop it off. And then it's like, you know, that saves me fucking. Two runs out to Rogers. This person disabled or something. Oh, he's at work till 10. I couldn't make his ass wait till 10. And if I can come to you. Yeah. But he's got curfew. He's got curfew. I think at 11. Yeah. And you just. Well, anyways. Well, that's cool. That was a good idea. I wish I fucking was like. Had that amount of money on deck. Yeah, I wish you would be there with me when he does come. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, honestly, you have the funds, like, basically, as soon as you get home, then. Yeah, I can tell him like, hey, come over right now. Yeah. I mean, I still only have like a little basically like 10 minutes before I have to fucking go and turn around and leave again. I could call him right now. Yeah. My GPS says I'm going to be at your place and. I didn't even I didn't even think about it, but even because I wasn't going to pay for it. But fucking the guy who was getting it didn't make it to the bank in time. So apparently he doesn't have it. So today, but I mean, either way, my friend has half of the money and it'll be fine. And I start. Hold on a second. Can I get a pack of Marlboro Reds, please? Yeah. Hey, stop. Stop fighting me. That one's yours. Jesus fuck. Kids these days are required. Yeah. OK, I'm back. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. That is super convenient that you're able to do that because. Well, yeah, I've been tricking, hustling my little heart out. So that's all I have. That's all my come up. So if this shit doesn't if it's not good or if it's fucking if he's trying to duff, duff me. Those would be terrible things. But luckily, we don't have to worry about that sort of thing. We don't. Absolutely not. I mean, even in the future, like if something like that did happen, of course, you know, the proper thing is to give everything back. Right. Right. Right. Right. Because he was just telling me, like, I did have, like, kind of a good, like, I'm happy every time I get to talk to Tom. But he was we're catching up a little bit. And he was telling me that, like, this other person that was basically in his role, like, a couple of months ago that I also know his name is White Nate or whatever. Yeah, he was. I guess he ripped off fucking, you know, half a for thirty five pounds. And, you know, basically, he and what he did, it was, like, super shady. He's like, he wasn't answering his phone calls. And, like, basically, like, our fucking records kind of look like you mismanaged it. And but he, like, fucking had a story and he said that a bunch of it was bad and and, like, didn't fucking want to, like, communicate to, like, fix it. So I guess half of it was fucking really pissed off, like, so pissed off. He was like, man, fuck Minnesota. Like, I'm not dealing with anybody out there. But then I hit him up. And then, like, you know, then Tom got out of jail or prison, you know. Tom. Yeah, his name's Tom. That's who we're meeting. Yeah. He's a big guy. He's a big, like, fat guy. I mean, I don't know if that's really the nicest word, but he's he's husky. Yeah. If you happen to be friends with him on Facebook, his Facebook profile doesn't look anything like the way he does in real life. So he doesn't look like a crackhead because I don't need people coming in my house looking like a crackhead. No. I mean, you look like a crackhead, but. You look like a crackhead. I don't know. Yeah, he's a big, hefty guy. I don't know if he looks like he fucking like he's got like that Tommy boy weight, you know. Yeah. Big pun or whatever. I don't know if you want to call it. Yeah. I'm going to have to retell my money, but I'm pretty sure I have that. I for sure have that. If you actually I'm going to put you on a brief hold. I'm going to fucking do a three way call with him. All right. All right. Just don't hang up. Yeah. All right. All right. Sorry. This is full and there is not enough space to live. He didn't answer. He didn't answer. Now he is. Hold on a second. Hello. Hey, I'm going to I'm going to merge the calls. Okay. Is that okay? Yes. All right. One second. All right. Okay. Okay. It looks like we're all here. All right. Hey, Tom. This is Becky. Becky. Tom. Hi. Hi. How's it going? Good. How are you? I'm all right. Yeah. Long day at work or what? Yeah. I just left work. I'm on my way home. Okay. I guess wondering if you just wanted to come over to my apartment. Would be ideal. Yeah, that'll work. Yeah. Another thing is she actually just mentioned that it would be like a lot easier for her to just use. Like she's got the money, her own money. She's going to wait for the other person's money, but I get just easier. So you don't have to wait to go to Rogers or whatever. So if you're actually available, like right now, I guess now would be a good time. If you're. I would have known 20 minutes ago. I got somebody who's stopping over here real quick. I mean, after that. Yeah, absolutely. That's available. Yeah, that's cool. All right. So I give you. Is it okay if I give her give the address to him then? Yeah. Absolutely. Send her phone over. Okay. Yeah. I can send that over. And then once I get your phone number, I'll send you the code to get into the building. Okay. And my apartment number. Yeah. Okay. Good. Thank you. I'm excited. I'll see you guys. All right. Sorry. Bye.",

Oh, it was really loud at first? Yeah. I'm in the bathroom. That's probably why. Yeah, I also have my, like, headphones on, too. But, so, I just wanted to kind of get a better understanding. So, I think, I think both of you may have not, like, noticed that I texted you guys each other. Like, I gave each other, you guys each phone numbers and stuff like that earlier. But, I don't think you guys noticed. No, you never did. No, you never texted me yet. Take a screenshot, and I'll show you a screenshot of mine. Okay. Oh. And then, once you did, once you did at 630, then I messaged him right away at, well, well, I guess I never. Okay, so, there's the first one. No, no, yeah, I messaged him. That's weird that my messages aren't showing up either. Because I just, I know I messaged him, hey, it's Becky. Weird. Yeah, I see. Like, in his defense, like, he, I think. Oh, oh, I see. I see. Oh, I see it now. Yeah, I fucking, I was kind of second guessing, and that message right before this, that I sent that, I was like, should I call you to do this, or is this text going to be, like, too much? But, yeah, I guess it probably wasn't a good time for you to, like, be able to read text messages, because you were just getting off work. And then, same for him, I don't know, I sent him your info, but he didn't actually realize I sent it until I sent it a second time. No. But. Okay, well, yeah, I mean, he did finally message me back and say, and said that. I don't even know what he said. Oh, yeah. He said, yeah, so it was kind of planned late, so I had a bunch of shit, and I wanted to get out of the way, and then I was way out in White Bear. I said, I get it, and then I said, are you coming, and then he never messaged back. Um, no, I, so, you know, I'm just a little bit, I don't know, I could share a little bit more of the backstory, how our conversation went, but, so, the price that we're, like, we're paying right now is actually cheaper than he actually pays. And he didn't know that until I told him. So, isn't that kind of funny? That's kind of funny? Yeah, isn't that, like, because even though, like, he, he pays, he actually pays more for, than I do, but. Oh, they're good? Yeah, because the reason I get the best price is because I introduced him to everybody. Oh, nice. So, like, I'm, like, I've got, like, I'm, like, grandfathered, and I got amenities, but, so, I don't know, he, obviously, he was okay with that number that, you know, I've been telling you, he was just kind of, like, shocked, because he's, like, wow, I sell, I sell these usually for, like, $2,800 to everybody else. I'm, like, okay, well, this is going to be the one person that you do this for, and don't do it for anybody else. Oh. Yeah. But. So, is he not going to do it, or what? What? No, he's going to do it. Is he going to do it? Well, yeah, he's going to do it. I don't know. Like, when? I don't know, should I try calling him again? I'll try, I'll do another three-way call. Yeah. All right. Uh. Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. 6-1-2-3-9-1-1-9-7-1 is not available. Sorry, the mailbox is full. Let me try hitting him up on Facebook, and I'll call you back. I'm not. Okay. Uh. Yeah.",

    "transcript": "Other calls: Tom Show @ 19m 47s Yeah, I finally got a hold of him. He didn't answer right away, but he said he's leaving the Westside area and he's on his way. He should be there shortly. Yeah, yeah, he said he's on the road now and he's coming from, I assume, West St. Paul. I don't know. He said to you where he was coming from. Was that White Bear or something? Yeah, he meant White Bear, but he said White Beard. Oh, yeah, that's where I was at when I headed your way. So he could probably be there in about 35 or 40 minutes. Well, I don't have, I gotta go to bed by like midnight would be ideal. Yeah, I think I must have, I was gonna message him something about you gotta wake up early in the morning. Yeah. Yeah. You want to text him and just tell him? He's honestly, it's kind of weird getting a hold of him. Because even though I have his phone number, and I talked to him like over the phone, he does not text me on it from his phone number. He's like, I have to text him on Facebook to get ahold of him. It's weird. Yeah, I don't know, try texting him or some shit. And he's not there. And like, if you don't hear from him or something like 30 or 40, probably 40 minutes or something like that. Actually, I'll just fucking tell him. I'll send him a text. Yeah, if you're gonna be longer than that, then it's probably not gonna work out tonight. Yeah. It's kind of what I figured. I don't know. So you said that you guys did like, say what's up at some point, just like not like seven or eight or something. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I have sent him a message, but I don't see that message. Like I said, Hey, this is Becky. You know. I didn't give you the number. And if he is on the road, I'm fucking calm. No point no harm in being direct. Yeah, I did. I did end up calling him after like he wasn't responding. Yeah. Oh, I'm so mad. But I'm, I've got some work to finish up on. So I'm just mad at me. No, no, no. I don't think mad is the right word. But yeah, that's a little bit. I get it. I just took a baking soda. Baking soda. Baking soda peroxide bath. And I just got my phone all wet. I gotta rinse off now. Okay. Are you still there? Yeah, I'm still here. I'm like, okay, just doing like work. Like work work right now. I'm on the phone. Yeah, I should be in bed. And it was any other time I would just say fuck it. I was just gonna say fuck it because my friend, I wanted it back out. But if it really is, it's good to be saying this. And if it's the same stuff that's like, that my dude is getting it from, I'm down there paying double that. If it's the same thing that you're getting it from, you're paying double what he gets. Yeah, like, if you get if it's like the same stuff, the same quality or whatever, you know, like, it would be crazy if I could get it that cheap. Because then I could probably still get rid of it. Because people are paying 28, you know? Just so I understand what you said just now clearly, are you saying that you get it, you can get it somewhere cheaper? No, I'm paying double. Like I was paying two, two grand. I couldn't even make anything out of it. I mean, I didn't do it that much. I just did a couple helping a friend out. But that's insane. But if it is the same stuff, I'm gonna just keep telling him it's from the same guy and make him pay two grand. When I can easily probably get 24, just like that guy's getting 28. You know what I mean? We'll see. We'll see what happens. But if he is like the main, you know, supplier guy, like a good chance that it is the same stuff. I don't know. Well, all I can say is the stuff that you're getting is that it comes from like, what I can say is the stuff that you're getting is not from around here. I mean, it's not like made in somebody's garage. It's like made in an industrial size quantity. Like the supplier has like, he said that he told me that he's got like airplane hangers full of it. Like he's got one in Miami, one on the West Coast, and a third place in Kansas City. And those are just the places I know about. Right. Yeah, because I actually, I know someone that wants two of them tomorrow. And that's a different guy, different than the guy that's been fucking around all day. And me and him, like he was short this last run, I had him weigh it out because I mean, it's his deal and whatever. And I just got it for him. And I was like, you weigh it out, you know, you do the work. And he did, but he took all fucking day and I've been waiting for him all day. And so, and my friend was just showing up to pick me up. I told him, I said, you need to hurry up because my ride's here, I got to go. And then he just kept going, like he was just flailing. When I said, I said, hurry, hurry, hurry, you know, and I rushed him. Well, apparently, hurry, hurry, hurry meant short the guy and don't give him his full amount that he paid for. Because apparently the guy was like 130 grams short, like almost like a quarter pound. Like, how do you go? How, how does that even happen? That's ridiculous. Number one. And then number two, it's my fault because I hurried you. That's fucking bullshit, dude. I would have never said, yeah, short him. That would have never came out of my mouth. I would have said, get it fucking done. I was just trying to rush you. It's not my fault you fucking are an idiot. Yeah. Me, I would have made sure everything was fucking, everything was kosher and good and fucking done right. Yeah, that is frustrating. I'm sorry. So I was supposed to get him one. I was supposed to, yeah, get him one tonight. And I was even going to give him a deal because I felt bad for him because he's going to pay for that at 30, 130 missing. I'm like, okay, I could see maybe like an ounce or two, but not, not, not that much. No way. And I watched him weigh it up. I saw it and I had him look at his calculator to see how much, you know, his past, recent, whatever. And if we're calculations are right, so he was like 70 grams short, even though short is short, you know what I mean? But still, like, it's not my fault. Right. I'm just pissed off. Well, hopefully. Honestly, actually, since you said the thing about two tomorrow for another person, I would have mentioned, do I? Yeah. If you get three out of three or more at a time, you get a price. Yeah. Yeah. If you get three out of three or more at a time, you get a price break, but you have to get like three or more at a time. But when you do, it is like, I think it goes down to like, like a thousand dollars per one or like something like that. I can't remember what the price is. A thousand? Would it be $300? How much are we? Because we're paying 13 for a full one. Yeah. That's what you said, right? But if you get three or more at a time, then the price goes down even further. Yeah, I get that. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you do have the people that would do that, then I would try to do this. You can fucking swing that sort of shit. I would totally do that because that's even more money. Yeah. Then I would take your money for sure. And also, well, I know, but it's only fair. There is fair. It's not, I don't, I'm not doing this for money. It's not what I wanted from you. I just want you to be happy and successful, but maybe I am putting a little bit too much quality, like customer service or effort and energy into it with you. I don't know. I have some discrepancies that are, that I'm noticing. And I don't know, I don't like the imbalance. Like what? I don't know. Our energies, I don't fucking know. It's messing with my energy, but I'm not seeing the same amount of like respect between you and I. From me? I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how to really say it without sounding like, I don't know. I had to like text it and write it down to make it make sense because I don't know. Yeah. But it's not a big deal. I mean, it is a big deal. I just, I'm finding a hard time speaking it in a way that doesn't sound annoying. Not annoying. I like to be professional. I like to be professional. I don't know. I don't know how to not annoying. I like to be professional and it's not about really my feelings. It's just about us matching each other's energy. And I respect. Like I'm not at all. Yeah. I just value, I put a lot of high value on our history, our friendship and wasn't really sure if that was being reciprocated. Right. I can see how you could feel that way. And that's not at all what, or how I want you to feel by all means. That's very kind of you to say that. I don't know what I could do differently to not make, you know, not so you don't feel like that. And, and maybe it's my, my doubting is why you feel that way. And it's hard for me to not trust you per se, because I trust you, obviously, and I trust you with everything, but it's just this game and these people, like, even tonight, that guy was my really good friend. And he literally just called me a freaking pretty much saying I'm sucking dick for rocks, pretty much like, and I wasn't even making anything off of them because it was so expensive already. And, but it just shows you, it's just like how grimy this like people can be. And I'm not at all comparing or saying that you would ever do that. So I could see how that would sound or feel that, you know, maybe my doubting, but it makes me nervous. You know, I finally not, not you, you don't make me nervous. Just this whole like deal does because I don't know the guy. Like, yeah, I know. I wouldn't. And I trust you. Right. I understand you. You're kind of a taking a risk kind of because it's an uncertain. Yeah. It's an unknown. Yeah. I understand that. And it's also kind of like out of, I don't know, a lot of people kind of like, Hey, you want to you want to meet this plug of mine? That's like high value. I don't know. No, I don't think that's very wise in a business sense to share that information with you. Oh, I don't want anything in return from you. It's just like, I want to be able to like support whatever it is that you're doing. Because I feel like that's how I can show you that I care. I care because I'm not able to spend a bunch of time with you. But at the same time, I also don't want like your mental state to like, or like, I don't know, I don't want this happy, healthy Becky to go away. Right. I am in a very good spot right now. And I, I see what you're saying. I most definitely don't want to go back to that either. Yeah, really break my heart. I mean, because I'm doing these things. I'm hoping to see a positive outcome. But I know that the danger lies that it could go very south. Like, I could lose my friends again. Yeah, I would break my heart if I had to be a part of that. Right. Oh, I forgot to text him. Yeah, put some fucking clothes on and stuff. Yeah, I did put clothes on. Oh, yeah, I see you when Oh, yeah, I don't know. I just have a call on the other stuff. 100 bucks to Andover. Do you think I could run to Andover and back before he even gets here? Probably, but I'd hate to miss it. It's so late for me to be out. If you're gonna be out, I might be like, hey, I actually have to run an errand. Can I meet with you somewhere to make this happen? Like right now? And if he doesn't, like respond to that, or something like that, then maybe two birds with one stone would be good. But then again, yeah, well, the rest is also pretty awesome. Right. I'm hoping that I just like, like he really is on his way and I could just meet him because that's more important to me right now. More money anyway, you know.

    "transcript": "It's going good. What's up? What'd you say? How did your first day go? It was like rough in the morning, but after I went to my counselor's office again this morning, she like helped me out, so I found a couple of friends and stuff. What did you expand on? How many more? So like this morning, it was just like super rough. I went to my first hour after my tour, and I was only in that class for like a couple minutes just because like I was doing my tour during that class. And then second hour, I hated second hour. It was horrible. I don't know. I just didn't know the material like we were already doing work and like the teacher had me do it and I just like didn't know what we were doing at all. You're like pretending pretty much? Not even that. And then also like when it was like work time, everybody just like everyone that was around me like left. I'm like, what the hell? Like why not say it? Sorry. I'm trying to understand. You're going to get a picture in my mind. Like what you're doing by all your statements, but I'm really having a hard time without you telling me more. So I was like, so like my geometry teacher, she like sat me down and she's just like, okay, you can like sit here. I'm like, okay, sounds good. I like sat there and then once like work time, like once we started working on like what she assigned, like everybody that was sitting next to me like left and went to like a different part of the room. I'm like, right. Okay. You didn't know if you were supposed to follow them or like? Well, no, I wasn't going to follow them. But it's not like that left the classroom. They just like left this part of the classroom that they were in. To like work on an assignment on their work together. Like it was kind of a clicky thing or is it? Yeah, like that. It was like a quickie thing. How long were you kind of sitting by yourself after that? Don't have to do the work or whatever. Yeah, so I like I didn't know what I was doing and then also like on top of that. Like I was like that not having your second hour. Yeah, sorry, excuse me. But yeah, second hour is weird. And then third hour it was my advisory. So I didn't go to that because I was in the counselor's office. Like it was rough. Third hour is your advisory. You didn't go to that because you were in the counselor's office. Yeah. And then what do you say about afterwards? So you said that you went to the counselor's office and then you met some people. Yeah, so my counselor. She like I guess kind of like helped me find some friends. So instead of going I also didn't go to my fourth hour. So what was it? So yeah, when I went to my stop Milo. I went to fifth hour and my fifth hour is lunch. So I did that and I found some like so instead of going to my fourth hour. What I did was like. There's like this room that like some kids go to to like just like, you know, like work on stuff and like skip class. I guess and that's where I was except the counselor told me to go there. So I could like find some friends. So I met Janae and then I met Aubrey and then I ate lunch with them and then they introduced me to like a bunch of people then also. So then I met Ava T. I met Hannah. And then I met Jury also. You're saying all these names really fast. I don't know how you are so good at like remembering people's names and I can't remember after five minutes. Well, I did forget this one girl's name. I have like three classes with her but I asked her what her name was earlier today like twice. And I'm like, I like forgot. I just like don't remember and I feel horrible because she's super nice and like she's super pretty. So when you see her tomorrow, you're going to be like, hey, I'm going to fucking ask Hannah what her name is again. So you don't have to ask her directly. Yeah, I'm not trying to ask her three times. That's insane. It's also like kind of rude. I fucking experience that all the time. I know. It's horrible. Yeah. It's highly ridiculous. I don't know if it's any consolation. I feel that way. All those family events that I go to with Gabby and I go and I see her fucking family and we had to go to another dinner tonight and because like Sophie got married and yeah, so it was like the whole family went out to eat. Yeah. I don't know. This is like probably the most we've seen her family in a long time. Yeah, but that's what I was thinking too. Yeah, I like barely if I can remember everybody's name and I know what happened since they were like kids, but I don't know. So I'm like sitting across the table from them like to like two or three times this week and I'm like, sorry, you're the girlfriend but or you're the brother and I know I've seen you a couple times, but I don't know your fucking name. Yeah, that's why I'm with like the entire family. I don't know anyone there. Yeah, that's why I don't really like going to those events. It's like I don't know who anybody is and honestly, but being totally honest with him when I went to my office in St. Cloud this morning like I had to say the same thing of three or four other people because I've known for like six months now. I'm like, I'm sorry. Actually. I called this guy Brian Kevin called this dude Kevin three times before he's like, it's Brian and I'm like, oh god, I wish I hadn't gotten that wrong. I'm embarrassed. Right? He's got a sense of humor. Just like kind of a dry dark sense of humor. So once she once I'm you know, he comfortable with me, I'm sure he'll probably retaliate with being a dick about it, but in a funny sort of way. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah, I'm talking about that though. You know, the office I'm talking about. Yeah. I'm on the phone with dad. No way. Yes. I don't know why I'm writing down your friend's names right now. I don't know why you're writing writing them down either. I'm doing kind of like some fucking work before I said, well, I did technically actually kind of all my work on a computer. Now, I'm just sitting on a tablet. Yeah. And the boys are running around in the living room now. But the day was okay. Kind of like busy driving. I went to St. Cloud for work, then back tomorrow, then to Minneapolis and back. When the second half of the day I had the boys with me. And they were getting kind of cooped up in the car. So that was a little irritating. Right. Alex, be quiet, dude. Well, I just wanted to call and I was curious about how your day went. I'm really happy to hear you met some people. And I think it's kind of turned around on the second half of the day. How do you feel about tomorrow? I feel like tomorrow is going to be better than today. Yeah. Yeah, I think tomorrow is going to be a lot better. Because, you know, I found some people Ava T. She's literally like the exact same person as me. I swear. Ava T. Yeah, Ava T. There's a lot of Avas. Ella's texting me. Did you shut off my data on my phone? Like, yeah. She's like, why? Because you told me you didn't care. Right. And I was like, I also told her I'm busy with work. She wants any of the conversations. You have to call me. And then she continues to text me and whatever. So she's irritating. Yeah, that is weird. What are the girls doing now anyway? They're talking behind me. Yeah. They talk about stupid girl stuff like eyeliner and whatever. Yeah, pretty much. Fair enough. Okay. Well, I love you. I love you too. All right. Good night, sweetheart. I miss you. All right. Good night. I miss you too. Bye. Bye.",

She was the last caseworker I was speaking with about, you know, the benefits and location, living, whatever. And I explained to her where me and the family were staying. And she transferred my account to a different county, but she transferred it to the wrong county. And so, I mean, I don't even want to bother trying to, like, call the next county and find out who it is that I've never met. But if she could just send it to the correct county, then... Oh, okay. Let me get into your case real quick. Do you by chance know your case number? I'm in the car, so now I don't have that information in front of me. Oh, sure. What's your first and last name? Brandon. Last name's Gillis. G-I-L-L-E-S. Okay. Okay. It looks like we transferred your case to Washington County. And... What's the county you needed to be transferred to? Um... One second. Olmstead, yeah. That's what it is. That's what I wanted to say. I just wanted to make sure that that was the right one, but Olmstead. Sorry, what county did you need to be transferred to? You cut out a little bit. Oh, Olmstead. O-L-M-S-T-E-A-D. Yeah. Okay. I think I'm going to just transfer you over to Brianna. I don't know if maybe we can request... But since your case is in Washington County, we can't now transfer it again since it's not in our county. But I don't know. There might be something Brianna can do as a financial worker to request your case to be transferred to that other county. Otherwise, you are going to have to contact Washington County to get your case transferred again. But let me just transfer you over to Brianna, okay? Okay. Just one moment. Hello, this is Brianna with Kineva County Family Services. I am unable to answer your call at this time. Please leave a detailed message and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thank you. You may start your message now. Hi, Brianna. This is Brandon Gillis. The number you can reach me at is 320-775-9130. If you can give me a call back, I need your assistance kind of correcting something. If you could... Again, this is Brandon Gillis. I don't have my case number, but you recently transferred me to Washington County and I needed you to transfer me to Olmstead. And if you could give me a call back so we could try to make that change. And there's also an additional thing I need done, but I'm sure that Olmstead County will have to be the one to help me with that. Thank you.",

Yeah, I hear you. One small task and small win at a time. How are you doing this morning? You call me like right as I walked into the office. As a matter of fact, a couple of minutes to need a couple of minutes to set your stuff down. No, no, no, no, no, no, I can speak. You can call me anytime. You know that, right? Yeah, I know. But your but your, your caseload and your everything you got going on is always very difficult. So I try to respect for sure. I do appreciate that. Yeah, sometimes it can be. But you know, there's definitely always time to talk. So yeah, for sure. How are you? How are you doing? How are you making progress? I saw that letter. The screenshot you mean? Well, that too. Yeah, yep. I saw the screenshot of your LADC time. Thank you for sending me that. And I can help remind you, you know, just to make sure that you get it, get it done. You know, the first the first try, you know, because speaking of like, large caseloads and wanting to respect it, you know, Tina has a large caseload. And we there's been like, you know, a pattern of people either cancer, like not making it and then having to reschedule. And, you know, she gets pissed. Yeah. Everybody gets pissed. Yeah. I know that I heard that that was a thing. And so far, I haven't actually rescheduled any of them. I've made all of them. But good for you. Yeah, yeah. I know that's important. Yeah, yeah. And I my I also my DAP note last night, I made sure to submit that in a timely fashion as well. Okay, yeah, that's awesome. That's a really good start. And a good, you know, I mean, smart goal for now is just, you know, as the appointments come to get them done, you know, because I know that whatever, however long it was ago that you were trying to come to the office and met with Zach, I don't think you ever charted for that. So I did. You did? Yeah, it was like four days late, though. Oh, okay. I don't remember seeing I'll have to go check. But it means you did. I mean, I remember I remember like, I eventually did, but I was I was late. Pretty sure. But actually, but now that I'm saying that, maybe you can just double check that I've double checked it. I mean, because honestly, one of those just like that time I put together the draft and I thought I sent it and I actually sat on it for like an additional two weeks. That's embarrassing. That should happen. It's okay. I mean, I had I had followed up with you about it. And like a couple days after the fact, when I noticed it, I think you had said that you were like, sick and not feeling well or something to that side. Um, which is, you know, obviously, like, it is what it is. There's nothing to you know, I have nothing to say about that. Like, obviously, you know, if you don't feel well, you know that health comes first. You know, but just like as far as yes, you know, moving forward being solution oriented. The objective is just to get them all done on time. You know, so I do. I wanted to actually since you did bring up Zach's name. That was one of the one of the most recent things I was thinking about just before I called you. So I know. So over the over the weekend, I think it was like Sunday. Yeah, it was Sunday. Um, you know, Bella, Bella. I can't remember Bella, mom, whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Made an attempt to get in touch with Cassie, the person that I transferred over. And, you know, Cassie, you know, kind of, hey, let me call you right back. And then I and then that like, really transition into like, I was like, Okay, yeah, I updated her over the phone and Cassie. And then I was like, you know, and Bella is coming to hire highly recommended. You know, if you're if you're comfortable, I'll do a three way call. And like, so I did that. And we sat on the phone, we actually I was I was driving out of Rochester. So we all sat on the phone and just kind of caught up, got to know each other for like, about 45 minutes. Oh, wow. Okay. And so that and, and I, I legitimately feel super comfortable that Bella is gonna, is gonna reach out and she's gonna bug her and she's gonna get to know her and like, I believe that that's a good, solid connection. And I feel comfortable with that. Yeah. But also, on the other hand, Zach, now, I don't, I don't know if I've mentioned this to you. Maybe you put it together already, because of my notes, but Zach is kind of like, my problem child or he was, you know, because I know that. And, and I was just talking to Cassie, like I talked, like I was in the cities last night for like a dinner. And I ended like, I had like 10 minutes to stop in and say hi to Cassie. And she told me, she told me that. That basically, Zach, like, I don't know, Zach, like, she, Cassie kind of babysits Zach, you know, on a, on like a street level thing. She's kind of like, they're kind of like family after the way they look at over after each other. But okay, that's their actual relationship. They're not actually related. They're just like, they're, I've introduced them a long time ago, blah, blah, blah. But Zach, Zach is kind of like, I'm personally actively concerned for Zach, because what, because, because I wasn't, because if I'm not meeting with him, like, like he's, I don't know, I just feel like he basically, he needs to be like, found. I don't know. He like left his phone someplace. I don't know. He's been in a significant state of depression. And he's gonna like, I don't know, it's crazy. Usually, he never like leaves his stuff places. But like, Cass, when I talked to Cassie, she, she called me, she's like, Zach was supposed to be back like a half hour ago. And I have his phone, I have his bags and stuff. And I don't know, I don't know where he is. So like, after and so I had to like call the, I'd like look up jail rosters, call his mom. And luckily, he is at his mom with a phone without his phone. But Oh, okay. I mean, I have a history of disappearing like that. Sort of. So like, he has a history, like, he'll get on a skateboard. And like, he'll fucking get into like some weird car accident or I don't know, like, yeah, he's just like, not like a series of misfortunate events. Yeah, he's like one of those fucking people that and I've always tried to convince him. I'm like, you know, maybe if you know, focused on mental health and good, good things and like, not like, you know, whatever. But yeah, yes, that's the word is for the steps backwards are staying still. I hear you. And basically, I'd be trans. Absolutely. Go ahead and jump in my bad. No, no, I want to hear what you had to say. I'll remember what I was gonna say. Okay. I was gonna say like, I was gonna because I didn't have anybody like you didn't tell me who you're going to transfer him to. I was just gonna maybe try to say, whoever that person is, if you could, like have them step on it a little bit and kind of jump, like reach out, I'm gonna be my answer right now. I was gonna say, let me be transparent with you, the person that we feel will be the best and or have the time or ability to commit to this person's higher level of excuse me on the higher side of, you know, level of care through our services. He had gotten locked out of his percent of account, because he got sick and missed his LIDC appointment during the last week of last month. So he has it scheduled for I want to say tonight. And then he'll get granted access to percent of again, but he can't meet the clients until then. But I can definitely have him reach out. But just so that you're aware that that you know what I mean? He could reach out today, but then it would probably be tomorrow that he could meet. But then also to bring back to what you're saying is, how are we gonna get a hold of him if he doesn't have his phone and he's at his mom's house? I mean, I got his mom's phone. Have you? Have you? Okay. And that's how his mom lives. She lives really popular apartments. You're familiar with Huntington Place apartments in Brooklyn Park in Brooklyn Park. Yes, I'm very familiar with that. I know. That's fucking funny. Everybody has like some history there. I live there. But that's like, yeah, everybody knows Huntington. That's where his mom stays. And that's like, his right now. That's like his shelter. But the dog again, has bit her twice. And, and, like, mom twice. Yeah. And like, it's fucking just so is he overstaying his welcome there because of that? Absolutely. And not to mention, like, like, I don't know. So like, that's good. You got a primary I understand. But can we also set up a secondary? Like, yeah, and kind of established that this person is a primary, secondary, and I'll like, try to get like, but I'm just kind of worried about Zach, that somebody really needs to be on him. Like to be like, hey, like, you're not like lost in the system. Like we do care. And Brandon is totally transferred you and you know, and honestly, he's so heavy. So have you I know that you said that you've been communicating with last time I talked to talk to her size. I had the day I've seen him. The last time you talked to Zach was the last day you see him. Okay. So then it has been a couple weeks. Okay. Did you guys have like a falling out or Nope, absolutely not. No way when you told him that? No, no, no, it's not nothing like that. Like, we're totally on good terms. Everything's great. But I, you know, I had to transfer my care to somebody else. And, and then I don't know, he's, he's got. So yeah, I guess to answer your question. No, there's no fallout. It's just he left his phone someplace. And Cassie's got it. So I don't know why Cassie didn't like logically just drop it off at his mom's house when she was in the area still. But mobile sometimes or what? Yeah, sometimes, but she's like, like, I don't know, obviously, I was dealing with. Yeah. Yeah. I get that. No. Yeah. It's hard. It's a full time job to fucking babysit Zach. And he, he like sometimes asked for it. But like, I don't know, he's his things are manageable. It's just like, CPRS needs to be good, like really good with their like, comfortable with talking to probation officers comfortable talking to medical men, men. Sure. Like I have like three different ROI signed for his probation officer, his insurance company. And I have that I have like signed for Generation Hope and myself to communicate with those people on his behalf. So I don't know what we want to do about those ROIs getting transferred to the new people. But that's a thing as well. Like what do you mean transferred to the new people? Well, I mean, I did I did like to write it. I did write in the ROI that I represent Generation Hope. I mean, to my knowledge, as long as it's from you, like, on behalf of Generation Hope, and then we're holding on to it, that it's just like the data. And that can be shared, because we're all under the same organization. I can double check on that, because every situation is different. And I don't want to miss misspeak. But yeah, yeah. Yeah, it sounds like you're doing your due diligence. I just wanted to get you out to kind of those are the things he does. The dog thing, living thing. He's gonna, he's gonna like eventually get hurt, or like, you know, fall off into the system. If somebody doesn't like it on him. Okay, but let me ask you, this is that, like, what, what are his goals, day to day needs or goals? Oh, like, goal management, the long term goal of housing, goal, man, like, goal management in general, like he has like a whole chaotic, like, just a whole spread of shit. Is this from undiagnosed mental health issues? Yes, definitely that underlying problem. Yeah, he is like, he's got under the arms worker. Well, he's got a court. So there's a there was a no contact order that was created that started was filed against him. Like, basically, when he was staying with his mom, like, last year or the year before. I'm guessing like his mom must have like vented to like an a PCA that she had at the time. And that PCA being a third party mandated reporter reported that there was like domestic, but like, not violence, but there was a domestic and, you know, even though like, it was basically like just a family argument, like the cops contacted him, he was charged with like, no contact, and then he violated that kind of no contact order, because he didn't even know it was in place. And like, now that when he went to court, like the public defenders, like, you know, trying to, you know, explain to him, okay, this is what's going on. And he's like, I've never got any notification. Like he, he's like, fucking totally confused. And like, why am I getting sent to jail for this? And, and then like, she's like, trying to say, like, you know, do her job. And ultimately, they ordered a rule 20, which is like a court ordered mental health assessment for value, which evaluation, like has to be followed through. And because there is a public defender doesn't find that he's competent to stand, stand trial or whatever. And, and that's one of the legal things. And basically, that's like an ongoing thing, like, but he's so so he's had one dangle violation, but he's back living with his mom. Yeah, yeah, like the the order was like this. How do I say this? It's not valid anymore. It was lifted. Yeah, correct. But the the court hearings are still ongoing. And like, yeah, he's still going to court for those things. Okay. So but you said they found that he was not competent to stand trial. Well, that's what they're gonna have to go to court or, or you're saying that's what they're trying hoping for. That's what they're trying to do. Like he's, he's like, the judges, okay, the judges ordered him to do those assessments. Like he ordered them like, like 90 done those assessments? No, like they need. I tried to like schedule them schedule the rule 20 for him. And then they're like, the fucking court has to have that referral made and like it has to be made by the court, not you. Not me. I mean, okay. And so like, he ended up getting picked up on the warrant. And then they sent him to, you know, bounce them around. And then they're like, okay, now we're reissuing the referral. And I don't know why they fucking didn't do it while he was still in custody. They released him like right away. So it's basically now he needs to do that rule 20 again. And, and like, also like he doesn't understand like what's going on in that court case. Like so whenever he's like goes in and speaks with that, that public defender, like I like insisted to him, I was like, next time you talk to her, like, let me talk to her. Because I've been the one talking to his public defender. Yeah, yeah, it absolutely sounds like there's a need for some transparency or communication. Because he shouldn't have let him, let him go without that referral if the referral was mandated or necessary in the first place. Right? Yeah. So, so, so as at this point, have you spoken to somebody from the county with them? Like, you know, is the county even aware of which county is this? It's the Hennepin County. Yes. I mean, so now that now that the now that the referral is like, issued again, like, I, that phone call could be made to like, to follow up and be like, hey, there's a referral out there. Let's see about getting this done. Because so, so have you been or are you aware of a place that will do that? Or have you? I did call and I did call and I have my notes about that. And I could share that with you. Yeah, no, for sure. Yeah. I mean, I can just look at it. Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, no, you're good. Um, I was just like those, it's just those things I was helping him manage, like active issues in his life is like, the progress that we made is going to like, all be for nothing. If somebody doesn't like stay on those things. But my huge concern is, but I think you got so right now. Yeah, can I can I ask you a question? Absolutely. In your professional opinion, do you think that he is going to need or requires a higher level of care? Honestly? Yeah, like, if there's like, there's like one of those things that I heard recently, where it's like, it's kind of like a rule 25. Like, it's kind of like detox, but it's like, specifically for mental health. I can't remember what those facilities are called, but there's a couple of them. And yeah, if it would be like one of those higher level of care where he gets like, that's the word. Yeah, that's the word, man. Yeah, thank you. That's what I was looking into. He doesn't need one of those. One of those would be extremely helpful. Okay. And, and explaining it to him. Like, I mean, I don't know if I, I would probably just for the sake of him trusting and his, I would explain that this is like, the next step in helping with getting mental health and all that shit. Because he's like, I don't know, he's like worried. He's like, he's got a mistrust for society, obviously, because of the mental health issue. And he's like, he doesn't want to get fucking like, taken in to some hospital against his will and all that shit and held without knowing. Can I ask you, is he still in active use right now? A lot of the time he's like, he does have like, say, he'll go like a month. Like, I've seen him go like six to 10 weeks, I want to say before I know for sure. He's one of those people that like, I'm pretty sure he's sober, but then like, it's evident, it becomes evident that he's not sober when he goes and he does something really stupid. Like, but I can't tell if he's under the influence when I'm around him, unless he's like, talking and talking and talking. Then I'm like, what's wrong with you? Are you high? Uh-uh. Like, for example, when we did his assessment with Kai Sen, that was the most uncomfortable fucking time because the whole time, the lady was trying to talk to him and trying to make a coherent conversation with him. And all he did was fucking la-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da the entire fucking time. She didn't know what to do with him. And he was clearly high that day. Are you saying he was like, nonstop talking? Or he was like making actual... No, he was not making sense. No, no, nonstop talking. Sorry. Like, yeah, it was so monotonous. And somebody that doesn't know him very well will be like, okay, I don't know. But it's to be kind of like... To be kind of frank, when I first met him, I was like, polite. And I was like, of course, just like you naturally would be with anyone. But then I realized that if I don't actually step out of my comfort zone and tell him to stop talking, or like, get him on track or something like... Yeah, snap them back, help them focus. Yeah, exactly. And it's totally... If somebody is not told to do that, like, in advance, it gets out of hand. And I don't know. But it was... I felt bad. It was like that fucking assessment. Because I did a three-way call for the phone call for that thing. And I was so uncomfortable. Yeah. I hear you, man. There's a lot of times where I have to literally bite the inside of my lip. And or like, get up and walk away if I can. At least just to like, you know, give myself a second to reset. You know, we're all human. But you know, patience is a virtue. I know you got it, dude. You got it. So what... So the next thing about... We don't have to talk about Zach this whole time. It sounds like you have enough information to kind of, like, take the next steps. And I could work with you on that. But on a good note, on the next good notes, like, things are popping off for me out here in the St. Cloud area. I've got, like, onboarding a couple more people and meeting with people that it's all kind of small progress and good things. What else? Yeah. I feel like there was other things. In this area, do you mean Mora? No, no, no. Like, St. Cloud, like, yeah, I've been doing my due diligence, going to the office, meeting with old clients. Actually, I met with, like, somebody that, like, I just met, like, somebody actually... His name's Dagan. I just onboarded him on, like, Sunday. And that's, like, somebody that I'm going to start seeing additionally. And that's kind of a big deal because, I guess, is... I don't know. It's just a big deal. But that's somebody I'm looking forward to meeting with. Like, I'm going to be meeting with him a couple times a week for sure. And that's, like, he's going to be, like, my new Zach. But thankfully, Dagan doesn't have as many fucking issues as Zach does. Yeah, for sure. I mean, it's, you know, it's a blessing to have both so that then you can have experience but then also so you can have perspective and have some gratitude in your life and not hate your job, you know? Like, it's always good to, like, put your best foot forward and especially give people, you know, like, you know, that extra help if they need it. If they're not receptive to it or if it becomes too much of a problem. I mean, at the end of the day, we're, number one, all human. But number two, like, that's why we're a team. And or that's why there's other levels of professionals that can help support this person. And it sounds like in this case, that's what he needed all along. But at the same time, we're there as a spout gap to help them advocate through, like, the legal system and stuff because he has such severe mental health issues that are underlying that, you know, it is only hurting him to not help him fully. That makes sense. I mean, I understand, like, you know, with him there had been that concern with his dog and what he would do. And like, I don't know as far as the earth's facilities, if they accept animals. But I also know that even trying to advocate for that is in some ways, like, not ethical based on how many times that we know that this dog has bit people. Something's got to happen. I mean, can I tell you something like a little personal and like private? I mean, so last night, this is a little bit and this might resonate with you. I mean, you've been to prison, right? Yeah, yeah. So I was watching this like little documentary, not documentary, but just a little interview of this guy talking about his experience in prison. And one of the things that he said last night was, you know, you go there and you know, you hear people just fucking in their cells just fucking screaming because they have such severe mental health issues and they like shouldn't be locked in cells. And like that fucking for some reason, like just super gouged me in a sense that like Zach is going to go to prison and he's going to be one of those fucking extremely tormented souls. If like somebody isn't like, I don't know. So that's where my anxiety is like, gets me somewhat emotional just thinking about that. Like, I don't know, you feel me? Yeah, no, for sure. I don't know. He's gonna be one of those guys that he's gonna fucking lose his shit. Because I just see the system like really fucking beats him up because he doesn't he's got too much on his plate. But a CPRS is like what a godsend for him. And I'm honestly like, extremely, I don't know, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna say to this part, take the take this take what I'm about to say, totally with a grain of salt and but I'm a little resentful about the whole having to transfer him because of like, just the concern that concern. But that's not I'm resentful towards like a Zach because I feel like, I don't know, I'm, I'm definitely putting the company's needs before Zach's needs right now. You feel me? I mean, what? Yeah, totally take that with a grain of salt. Don't don't take don't don't leave this conversation. I don't mean that to imply anything negative. But I was totally bent in when I said that just now. No, I hear you. I respect your opinion. And you're in your that's your truth. Thank you for sharing it. I'm glad I said that. I feel like I needed to say that. I hear you. I mean, like, I think I've made the same sentiment clear the last couple of times we spoke, like, as long as you are meeting with your clients up there, then you know, you can still like, see people in the city, there just has to be like, you know, equal effort and or demonstrated progress. So like, as far as his, you know, his needs go, obviously, you have the most history and familiarity in the situation, like, I don't see anything wrong with you, you know, continuing to work with him, or at the very least, like, be a part of that person's team, right? Like, as a secondary, of course. So yeah, solely on you, you know, I know, I know what you're saying. Thank you. I do. I do consider myself a secondary. Like, if I'm, I mean, I'm there in the case of like, if an emergency, or like a late night thing, like, I'll be there. I'm totally like comfortable. I don't want to like, I don't want you to think you have to like advocate for me. I really don't want to get on anybody's fucking bad radar as far as Yeah, you know, causing a stink. So yeah, no, for sure. But I mean, like, like, as far as that, you know, that's concerned. And, you know, like making sure that they don't, you know, go without services and fall between the cracks is, is the most important thing, you know, especially like in this situation, like, the peer that I had discussed, being assigned to him was, you know, again, like in this personal situation where he was, he's been locked out for the last five days. So, you know, it's just one of those timing things. But would it be possible for you to be like an additional person? Secondary? Just I mean, I could, I could, I could try. I mean, I could reach out, I could try to see him, but it would be probably, you know, not consistent. I mean, I know it wouldn't doesn't have to be consistent at all. Like, absolutely does not. But if you could be like, the person that, hey, I'm just calling you, like, have you heard from your person? Or what are you doing? And you're just kind of keeping tabs on them over the phone until something I just Yeah, I can. Yeah, I can definitely do that. Yep. I mean, he's gonna have to get his phone back. But yeah, I know. No, I mean, listen, it happens. You know, clients will forget their phones in a lot of places. Hopefully, it's just your car. So then you can drop it. Yeah, no kidding. No kidding. I'm just showing up for my first appointment for the day, actually. Okay, sounds good. Well, thank you for calling me. Thank you for sharing with me, you know, the different details as well as you know, your your opinion and your everything else. Yes, that I should have shared some of this with I should have fucking saved this for my, my account, my counseling appointment with the LADC. I got you. I mean, that's the she's that's also what she's for. So no worries. Yes, so you too. All right. All right.",

I talked to Sadie and, uh, basically need to, um, and my attorney called me back, but like, there's a reconsideration thing on the form, like where it gets denied that I have to send it back with the document saying that the court ordered, you know, the reversal of it basically. And just some other, like, you know, like maybe even my treatment, like whatever, basically just things that I got to send them like the doc, the judgment or order or whatever. And then possibly like your, uh, CD assessment that says that you repented treatment, like things that say that I've done good things basically, like all the things I've done after this, the maltreatment stuff. And then that reconsideration will happen. And Sadie said that, like, you know, since I like quit my job, I can try a few other treatment centers and see if I can start with them and then just go to Recovering Hope in the summer. Or she said, as long as I can get this reversal done and if it's like mid past mid February, like I can still apply at Recovering Hope, like as an RA or something and just work there until the summer. So I have a few options basically. But yeah, I'm just gonna, I still need to fill out the form and print off some things and then send it in the mail like ASAP so that that can kind of start taking place. In the physical mail? Yeah, I have to send it in the physical mail. From where? To, I don't know, it's on the, it's on the paper. It's like somewhere in Minneapolis.

I could be, but when I dropped off my last client, instead of going, like, just getting right back on the road, I came back to the office. Yeah, the office is, like, basically closed down now, but so it's, like, just me in here. And I was gonna fucking, like, I have a bunch of shit to print off, and, like, I was gonna do a couple of things, but, you know, I'm still thinking about that. I figured I would just give you a call and see how things were going. Nope, good. My brother took me to go pick them up, and then he was nice, because we were, like, driving through the parking lot or whatever, and I was, like, oh, yeah, it's funny, when Alex sees the McDonald's thing, he says, go, because he saw, like, I forget which sign he said, and he was, like, go, and he was, like, oh, do you guys want McDonald's? And I was, like, well, I don't have any money, and he's, like, oh, I'll buy it, and I was, like, okay, I mean, if you're offering, so we ate McDonald's, and we've been chilling ever since. Yeah, I'm sitting on the recliner, and Alex is sitting next to me on his tablet. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, Alex ate all his food, Atlas ate a decent amount of his food, but he still had some on the table. Nope, speak of that, he just, he saw it on the table, and he's, like, oh, I should eat some of that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess these kids just like music, like movies or something, I don't know, because I put, because once Atlas finished, like, or not finished, but he was done eating, I changed his diaper, because he had already shit himself when I picked him up, and I changed his diaper, and then I gave him his, like, Blue Powerade or whatever in his bottle, and then he went in his room, and I put The Incredibles on, and he did not want to be in there, I guess, and watch that, because he's very into this movie. Which one? Alex, or Encanto. Oh, Encanto. Yeah, Alex just finished his drink and put his drink in my face. I see that, help me out, doors, doors, doors, this is home, we have to say hi, oh wow, hey. Dude, it's fucking such a busy day. Yeah, I had, I was working, I was working with one of my clients, well, a couple clients today, and one of the things that we did was we went to, like, the different homeless shelters that they have in the area, and there's, like, two of them, and, like, one of them is called the Lincoln Center, that I mentioned to you that, like, there was some talk about me starting there, or something like that, or doing some fucking whatever. Okay. And I went in there, and it was, like, nothing like I imagined it was, it would be, and. Is it really nice? Yeah, yeah, it's nice in there. Well, I just didn't know what you would have imagined, I guess. I would imagine, like, not, like, the best, like, facilities, like, not any shame to them, but, like, I would just imagine they're not, like, very funded or something, and so it's not, like, super nice. Yeah, I don't know. I just, I try to withhold all those sorts of opinions, like, I did, I did, I mean, I guess that would be the down-to-earth fair assessment. You know, I guess, equally as shocking, like, honestly, I don't fucking know of any, like, homeless shelter like that in Minneapolis, even, like. No. I mean, I'm sure there's got to be, like, something, like, like, Salvation Army, blah, blah, blah, but, yeah, I don't know if there is. Nobody's told me. I haven't heard of one. Yeah. And, but, yeah, they got a couple of them here, and, yeah, I went in there. I was a little surprised, and some of the things that I was told were a little, I don't know, shocking, but I can see, like, how, like, conversations may have started with Generation Hope wanting to partner with these different organizations out here, and, yeah, I asked, so I met with, like, two different, like, administrators there. They weren't, they weren't, like, the program coordinators, but they're, like, you know, people that, like, basically were people of authority that was in the office at this time when I went there, and I was, like, if there was, I, like, introduced myself and was kind of just being friendly and letting them know what I was doing there, and, yeah, I was, like, you know, if there's, if there was, like, any pain points or anything that you guys would like to see changed, you know, that would make things better for you guys as staff, like, what would that be? And they're, like, they said to bring more, like, recovery resources here. Yeah. Because they, like, they don't have a whole lot of, like, community, like, I don't know, like, resources being offered there, and I guess for them, like, it seemed when they're, those services aren't being offered, their things seem rather bleak, like, hopeless because they're outnumbered, and the chaos is never-ending. Right. Yeah. It's interesting. Yeah, I have some thoughts and stuff like that for improvement. Yeah. Well, I got to, so I guess I'm just about to sit down at my desk again, and I've got a couple of reports. I've got to write, like, two of them, and then I got some other things to print out, and I'm going to stay here and try to get the last eight hours, and then when I get that, I'll probably start heading home. So, I've got an hour and 25 minutes before I've got, get it, my, okay. Okay, hour six, seven, so you should be home, like, around eight? An hour and a half from now, plus an hour, whatever that time is. Well, it's five, so an hour and a half from now, it's 6 30, and then, yeah, 7 30. That's what I said, like, around eight. Maybe. Give you, like, 30 minutes to pack up, and whatever, lollygag. Yeah, yeah, yeah, sounds about right. Okay. Well, I'll check in with you in an hour and a half or something. Did you send me the stuff I asked you to send me? I sent you an email. I think I forwarded the dismissal thing, but I need to go on my worst thing to find my pay stub. Yeah, you should do that, because I need, I need to, I need to. All right, well, I love you. Don't get too distracted. Finish what you need to do. Copy. See you soon. All right, will do. Bye. Bye.",

He's out ice fishing right now. And he's like, come get me, and we're going to go to the bar. Holy shit. Huh. And I... So? Yeah, basically. I don't... And now that you're on the phone with me, there's a realistic chance that you may be getting raped tonight by me. I can what? I said, now that I'm on the phone with you, there may be a realistic chance that you may get raped by me. Oh. Oh, good. Did you just say, oh, good? Yeah, I'm just kidding. Yeah, you should be kidding. Do rapists wear condoms? No, I've never asked. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I don't think they'd tell you. Yeah, I don't... Don't ask, don't tell things? Yeah, but if they don't want to get caught, you'd think they don't want their semen. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't know. I feel like, I guess, the person that is... I don't know. I watch too much CSI, so right now my brain is exploding, but I can't tell if there's a joke at the end of this or if... Are you actually asking for a friend? Like, did you get raped and somebody left a condom in you or something? It happens to all of us. I hope that it's been sneaky. I'm just kind of hoping. Yeah. And I wonder how nice my electrical bill is, like, 170. I got, like, every light in the house on and the fucking TV blaring. Yeah, I mean, honestly, I do the same thing when you're by yourself. It's like the way you kind of, I don't know, evade. Like, I don't know, the house gets scary when it's dark, you know, and there's nothing going on. I like it all lit up. There's a party going on at my house, and I'm the only one invited. Yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. Dude, I fucking... Hey, kind of odd, random question, but do you know of any actually homeless shelters that are in Minneapolis? Because I've never heard of one before. Yeah, well, it's more like I've heard of, like, women's shelters. Oh, yeah, like battered women's shelters. But those are, like, houses usually, right? I don't know at all. I've never been to one. Well, I guess the reason why I ask is because, yeah, I was working out in St. Cloud today with a client and a couple of different clients, and they... Oh, fuck, I just took a wrong turn. And they took me to these two different homeless shelters, and one of them, like, I've already kind of heard about, and it was, like, not what I was expecting at all. Oh, yeah? Yeah. And then, I don't know, then I met, like, another client, like, and she's, like, female, and she's, like, I don't know, like, she seems cool, 40, like, and she told me she's at this place called, like, Hope and Love or something like that. And I'm, like, oh, that sounds nice. And I told her, and she's, like, yeah, it's a homeless shelter. And I told her where I was at. She's, like, oh, yeah, this place is way worse. And I'm thinking to myself, like, so what, it's, like, a prison? I don't know. Because I'm just, like, do you know how to fight or something? Like, I don't know. Maybe you had to be there to really fully get it. But I could see, like, the need of why, like, a company like mine would partner with a homeless shelter because of, yeah, it gets kind of dark in those homeless shelters. You know what I mean? Oh, yeah. I guess, like, one of the people that knows the area really well, he's, like, yeah, even the staff here smoke meth. I'm, like, are you serious? Like, that's crazy. Yeah. But, yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just, it's been all work, work, work today. And I'm, like, super excited to just get out of the house and not have to think about work for a little bit. And, you know. But it sounds like you had a good day. Yeah. Oh, actually, no, it was the opposite of that. You had a bad day. I was listening. I was listening. I don't know. You just have, like, such a fucking awesome voice. I love hearing it. Yeah, that you just, like, black out when I talk or what? Oh, my gosh. I don't know. No. No. No, I don't even like you like that, dude. Besides, you're, like, you're, like, my sister or something. I would never hit it with you. Oh, yeah. Sounds good. You're not even my type. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I tell all the boys. So you're not. You're not my type right now? Or was that, like, in my imagination you said that? I think you're imagining it. Okay. All right. That's fair. I could be. I totally hysterized that. My bad. Yeah, absolutely. You should be. You should be sorry. Oh, my God. So I'm definitely not going to make excuses for Tom's tardiness. All I can really say for sure is when he does make himself available and present, I don't know, it's really hard to stay mad at the guy who's got, like, three pounds for you. I just want to throw that out there because I've seen that dynamic before. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. If I, like I said, I did message Pepe. I've, like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Pepe. Ivan. I don't know. I just don't like saying his name. But I messaged him. And although he may not get back to me tonight because it's so late, like, since all this shit comes from him and he's, like, pretty much the boss of the stuff. Yeah. So I don't know. I really don't want to. I don't want to say that it has anything to do with this. But, like, that weird discrepancy about the cost, that, I don't want to say. But that does sound like a. Is that a fucking sneeze, bro? Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. I mean, because we're getting it cheaper than he is. I mean, that's crazy. That's crazy, isn't it? He was, like, surprised. Like, really surprised. But I don't think he's going to like it. Yeah. Stop him from making the transactions go through. Because that would be, like, not professional and all that shit. Right? But he may not like the idea that he's. That we're getting it. He's giving it to us for less than he gets it for. Right. And it doesn't really fully make sense. Because he moves, like, way more. Than us. Than me, of course. How do you know? How do I know what? Yeah. How do you know? How do I know what? How do you know this, jefe? So. When me and Todd worked together. And when me and Todd and Cory worked together in St. Michael. Doing that shipping and labor business. There was a lot of Hispanics there. That, you know, were just fucking super from. You know. All sorts of the Hispanic culture. And. This guy. We had a new guy come in. Like. At some point. His name is Ariel. He's, like, super into the clubbing fucking scene. And, like, I think he started his own security company. Well, we met Ivan through Ariel. And Ariel is still. Actually, he did leave Tom's company. Like, that business. And he started his own. He, like, works for different nightclubs. So. Yeah. Works for different nightclubs. And offers private security. Services. But, yeah. So that Ivan. Is somebody that he knows from fucking Mexico. Because. But back then. Oh, and Ivan, I guess, did even work for this. Same company out in St. Michael for a while, too. But he didn't like it. Because of the physical labor that was involved. So, yeah. Then Todd. When he ended up, you know, relapsing quietly. And then he knew that I was fucking clearly slanging like a motherfucker. Ivan is, like, hey. You know. You know what I can do. You know what I'm trying to do. And I want you to. Put your. Put together everybody that you think. Would be a good. That was a good. That was a good. That would sell. And. And Todd. Shared that statement with me. And although. Like, it was. Very, very extremely unorthodox. Like, in the. In a community. The math community. But if you ever been heard about. Like, how they do those. Like. You know, those, like, events that, like. The convention center. Well, I basically hosted one of those with every single person that I knew. That sold math. And I had every single one of them come through. Within a 12 hour. Period. And literally. Shared with them. You know. Whatever. Like, are you interested in this opportunity? You know. The reason why you're here. The reason why you're hearing these words is because. You're in. You're somebody that I trust. And I did that with. Everybody that I knew. That was of my gangster. Yeah. And I. And now. And because I did that. Ivan was introduced to everybody that he knows in Minnesota. And. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'm frequently that person. That. For everybody. Actually, there's a lot of people that I know. That kind of share that. Thing. Hmm. What? Cool story. Yeah. Did you like my story? Or did you fucking stop listening? And lots of information. At once. It was. Do you like it, though? Should I, like, trim it up or something? Yeah. Or, like, add some, like, gunshots or something in it? I don't know. Yeah. That's fair. Maybe, like. I mean, well. There is, like, some exciting parts. But you didn't ask about those parts. I mean, there is. There are some other parts of the story. But they come, like, literally after that whole. I mean, after I introduced him to everybody. You know, shit got more interesting. Because he learned who to deal with. And who not to deal with. Yeah. I just asked him if it would be easier if I came to him. Like. What's the deal? Like, I thought it was nice if he came over here. Because then he could see where I live. And he wouldn't be like a fucking cop or whatever. You know? But. Maybe. He's just fucking flailing too hard or something. I think it is. I think that's what the deal is. Like, it wouldn't be so fucking. Much of a mental fucking thing. If he. God damn it. It wouldn't be such a mental thing. If he, like, was comfortable calling you. And, like, knew. He wouldn't be like, hey, I'm here. But, I don't know. I'm going to fucking call him. But right now, I'm fucking also, like, driving in the middle of fucking nowhere. I need to. Where the fuck is this address? Well, I'm usually in bed in, like, an hour. Like, I just laid down. And I know I could fall asleep instantly. So. I've been staying up and cleaning and moving around. Just to stay up. But. I'm getting pretty tired of that. I cannot find my wax for my hair. At all. For my, like, waxing my face. Yeah. And. I feel like you hid it on me. Oh, wait a second. Wax? Yeah. My wax what now? What did you call it? It's wax for my face. Like, little hair wax. And I just can't find it. Like, I bought a brand new one. And I didn't even open it or anything yet. Can you tell me what it looks like? It's like a little round circle. Jar. Looks like honey beeswax. Almost. But it's, like, a bigger jar. Yeah. That does sound really familiar. Yeah. That does sound, like, familiar. I'd be suspicious of me, too. Honestly. Yeah. Yeah. Like, where did you move it to? Yeah. But, like, I know that a lot of your stuff went into that junk drawer. Like, almost all of the little stuff. Yeah. This is too big to be in there. But I really wish I could find it. Because I wonder if it's in a different drawer. I did kind of look. But, you know. And I know it's just somewhere, like, out in the open. Like, right in front of my face. Yeah. And I'm super just, like. And I really want to wax my face. So bad. Yeah. Well, that better be the only thing. It's not the only thing you want to wax if I'm fucking going over. Actually, I can almost guarantee you I'm not going to come over. And you know why? Because I'll be sleeping. Yeah. Because you need your sleep. And if I do come over, like, there will be expectation, actually. So we don't have to do all that. Yeah. Well, yeah. What the fuck? Oh, there you go. Found the zip ties. You won't get zip tied up. That's right. Oh, I got cleaning gloves. Those should go under this thing. I hope I didn't forget my fucking grape thing. Or whatever the fuck. If I don't eat your pussy in the next fucking 30 days, though, honestly, I'm not going to be friends with you for a while. Because I put up with too much of your shit. Oh, yeah? Yeah. And your jokes aren't that funny. And neither are your dance moves. So that's what I'm fucking after. Just so you know. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Is that right? Yeah. My mouth. And I want your fucking dick down my mouth. Or vice versa. You want my dick down your throat. Hmm. I can make that happen. Oh, my God. Make me correct myself again. And it's going so deep down your fucking throat, dude. I swear to God. You'll die. You said it. This is all you, boo-boo. Yeah. You know what? If you don't call him right now and tell him that you really need him to meet up with me because I'm really important in your life and I really am going to kick your ass. I don't know what to say. Yeah. Actually, I'll call him again. I'll do it right now. A brief hold. Yeah. Hello. Hey, Tom shows me the message. Give me a call back. Trying to meet up and see if there's anything I can do to, I don't know, maybe come to you or whatever, give you some money, but just make it some money tonight. I hope everything's okay. Give me a call back. Little worried about you. I'll talk to you soon, but I left him a voicemail. In a very positive nature, like, hey, buddy, just making sure you're okay. There's anything I can do to come to you and make things easier. So I'm make sure you're okay, whatever. So I don't know, want to make money. Everybody wants to make money. Yeah. Come down here tomorrow and meet up with him. It would be like really basically be about this time, like nine o'clock, eight o'clock, seven o'clock sometime because I'd be coming. I'm supposed to like check out this car. I just run a diagnostic on somebody's car around like six o'clock in St. Cloud and then after that, I'm going to. But honestly, I would like to come out there around that time. And I think I could do that because I really don't like going home and you're not fucking being at my house. I feel like the daytime. I don't know. I just feel like he's not answering at nighttime. Yeah. So you're you didn't say that you got a hold of him, like in the beginning of the day, you sounded like he was communicating and all that. Yeah. What was that about? Yeah. You got time to kind of tell me what what. Yeah, I just seem like he was communicating, texting back and forth and telling me he loves me already. And it's OK. I'm sure you probably get it a lot. He was answering and he seemed pretty certain about 730 before 730. I asked him if he could meet me right after work. Like right when I get off of work at five. It was like, oh, I got some stuff to do. So probably around 7, 730. And I was like, well, do you know of a more of a better time frame? And he said before 730 for sure. And then when 730 came around, I said, I'm going to be a little late. And he said, I'm going to be a little late, too. So thanks for calling. Seemed all cool about it. And then eight o'clock and then it's like the text messages slowly started going further and further apart. And then he wasn't answering my phone calls at all anymore. Things kind of apparent to me that I should. Yeah, you're right. I need to make a physical effort to get down to where you're get down there to just go wherever he's at. He told me, like, I can look back at the phone recording and hopefully I didn't turn the recording off because, like, I don't know. Sometimes I do with those high profile fucking conversations, but I got to just respect, I guess. But he might have he did tell me, like, where he's staying and it's in Anoka someplace. And I want to say it's like he said, yeah, I'm staying right by, like, the library or something like that. But I don't want to guess if I can be better if I just look at what he said for sure, because he's like, yeah, just stop by. And if I can look up where it was, he said that he stays. I just feel like I'm in the area. I'll come by and do it kind of at a time where I know he's going to be at home in the morning or some shit. I don't know. Yeah, maybe more a little more with it. Yeah, it's like. Yeah, sounds like. Sounds like. He must have grew up in Anoka, huh? You know where my mom lives, right? In Ramsey. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He his place was two blocks away in that same neighborhood. It was actually it's kind of a little awkward the way we first met each other, because apparently he you. There was this girl named Laura. She's a dealer, and he and her were friends. They lived together. He fucking ended badly. And she was telling me about how I should go fucking rob this guy because he deserved it. And I was actually going to go actually go fucking rob him. Like under the under certain circumstances, I was like, I'll go do it. As long as you don't fucking say anything to anybody and it remains a secret. I don't give a fuck. I'll do it. And and I was like so serious about doing it. But then I end up not doing it for some reason. And then I ended up meeting him. And I feel like at some point he was he was aware of the potential for danger relating to me. So once we did and have a sit down, I was like, kind of cut clear the air. I was like, hey, I just want to introduce myself. I'm Brandon. You know, I think I heard of you. You know, we know some new people, some sane people. And we fucking since then, it's like I was up front about that whole thing. Hey, can I give you a call right back? Yeah.",

    "transcript": "Other calls: Becky Aspinwall @ 7m 5s Hi, Papa John's. How are you doing? Magnificent. I'm in my bed. Comfortable. Good. Glad to hear that. CCC. Yeah. Uh. So you're just getting ready for bed? No. Do you hear the people upstairs? No. Do you hear the people upstairs? Do I like lobster? No, do you hear the people upstairs stomping? Do I hear the people upstairs stomping? Yeah, my house, not yours. No, I don't hear them. Is it that loud? It's very. Are they partying or what? They party every weekend, so I don't know if they would be there. Yeah. Yeah, that can be frustrating. Yeah. Well, basically, I'm here to catch up on the data thing. Oh, like you want me to look at the fucking dates, the exact time or whatever? Oh, shit. What does that mean? Maybe explain what you mean by that. Oh, the data. Like me turning on your data thing. Yee. I plead. I beg. You do. I reach my hand into a sewer pipe. Kiss a rat. So, sweetheart, you don't have to beg me, but you have to understand what it means. You have to understand what it means to have it. Why is it that I was going to take it away? Well, I know why it was taken away. And could you explain to me why or what I'm trying to accomplish doing that? I was being more respectful and for mom to have, like, for us to, like, be more reasonable and, like, less confrontational with mom and you. Yeah, actually, I think you did say something earlier that was really significant that we both didn't really say something about, but yes, it sounds like you got the idea, but you also kind of said something really smart and you said something like, you know, sorry, like, sometimes when there's, like, some sort of anxiety or you're not sure, like, how to act or something like that, your natural reaction is to behave rambunctiously because it's kind of a defense mechanism. Yeah? Yeah. And about health. Right. So, I mean, I think with that being said, I mean, it's important that we probably both acknowledge that. It's good that you said that because now it's kind of like we can both be kind of cognizant of that, of, like, you know, situations where that may become relevant to you. So, if you are kind of acting crazy, like, we kind of can bring it back down to a place where it's like, hey, I don't know, we can control it. As long as we know it's there, we can control it, is what I'm getting at. Yeah? Yeah. And, uh, so that's an improvement. And you understand, like, just on our end, like, it's not like you that we're having a problem with or, like, what you're doing, it's just like the, I don't know how to fucking word this part, dude. It's not you, but it's, you know, the you that you control. Like, it's my actions. Yeah, yeah, it's just, we just, I'm glad that we had to talk, and I'm glad that we, but yeah, that was the reason why the Wi-Fi was getting taken away. That and you guys, well, I know I did put a big fucking emphasis on how mom is experiencing and overwhelmed, but I also fucking thought, like, there's, I don't know, you guys have just been fucking throwing an incredibly large amount of, like, I don't know, just that attitude towards me lately, and I can, obviously I'm a fucking grown-up and I can take it because I have taken a lot more fucking lashings than you guys' little fucking lips have, but, um, yeah, I don't know. I feel like you guys, it is crossing the line to the point where you guys actually may have not the right amount of respect that I require. Am I saying that clear? Yeah, I feel like... Yeah, I feel like either you guys need to, uh, yeah. Like we seem like we're lacking respect for you? Yeah, like, in a realistic sense, like, you guys either want me to, like, like, beat you, like, in public or, like, not talk to you or something like that. It's like you guys are asking for me to not like you. And, and I know that that's not the case, so I don't know, let's just, I don't know, we'll figure it out, okay? We'll work together. How the fuck did I just get lost again? Are you driving? Yeah, I am driving. I was supposed to go pick up somebody from the, pick up somebody, um, like, sober cabin, basically. Oh. Yeah, this is exactly what this is. A sober cabin thing for somebody, a friend of ours that was under the influence here in the Mora area, but I don't fucking remember what his, I had, I don't fucking remember what his address is, so I'm, like, driving through areas that I thought was his, I was gonna find his place, but I cannot find his place on my Google Maps, which means that, um, uh, this guy's kind of fucked. Oh, oh. Hopefully he doesn't, like, die in a fucking, die in a fucking ice castle, ice fucking house. Fish house. What do you call that? Fish house. Um, are you talking about an igloo? One of those fucking portable fishing houses that you put on lakes. Oh, I don't even know what that is called. Yeah, it's called an ice house. I wouldn't know. Except for ice fishing. I never went ice fishing to my knowledge. Yeah. Alright, I'm gonna try to call this guy and make sure everything's okay, but I love you. I'll turn it back on in a minute, okay? Okay, thank you. Alright, goodnight, bye. Hello? Hi. Hey, how's it going? I just wanted to let you know that he did call, and he is almost here. Allegedly, but I believe him, because I could hear him on the road. And he was, like, driving through Champlin, then he was, like, on 252, so he was giving me, like, play by play. So, I'm like, okay, and he kind of told me the situation he was kind of dealing with, and I was like, okay, I get it. I get it. I'll let it slide this time. I'm just kidding. But yeah, I was just getting nervous there for a little bit. Not even nervous, but just irritated. I know. I know how you feel. Hope I want to fucking beat your box. I don't know, honestly. I haven't... But I have learned my lesson, for sure, about fucking driving long distances without you knowing of an advance, because I was fucking... I was a really good sport. Whatever. It's whatever. It's a little bit my mistake. I was just... Do you want me to come and see you tonight? Because I... I would love that. Number one, did you get a car or something? I'm in a car right now. I'm driving, yeah. You're driving your baby mama's car? Yeah. Number two, I would totally say that, but I know, like I said, my bedtime is midnight, and I'm very strict about it. Very, very strict. Otherwise, and not even strict, it's just I can't stay up any later than that. I try. He did say something to me, though, on the lines of that you weren't very clear to him about how much I'm paying. And so then I kind of... He knows. Right. And that's how I was kind of like I was going to be like, oh, well, I'm on the understanding that you're well aware. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so I just kind of was like... I was kind of like, well, you know, just kind of we're talking, like getting to know each other, I guess, a little bit. And I was like, well, yeah, you know, and I actually, like, when Brandon told me he had someone for me, you know, I kind of like, you know, told him no at first because I just I didn't know. I didn't, you know what I mean? Like, there's such a sketchy business, high risk, and who knows and what and this and that. And I said, it's not like, it's not that I didn't believe him because Brandon's never lied to me, but it was just like, I was scared or nervous, just as much as you're nervous, I'm nervous, too. I'm like, I'm just like a fucking little girl, like I'm not a girl, I'm a woman, but I'm just five foot two. And that's what I said to him. And I said, but for the price that he was telling me and gave me a little backstory on who and whatever, I said it's something that I just couldn't really pass up either. And yeah, so when I said that, I was kind of hoping, I'm like, okay, maybe he's going to be like, all right, she knows. Well, it's good because I pretty much worded said that exact same thing to him word to word. I was like, because he, I mean, it's pretty clear, obvious a discrepancy, but like he maybe needs to be kind of, maybe he doesn't think about it every time, but he probably doesn't fully know that I was the one that, I mean, there's a reason why I may get a better price than him because I'm the reason why he knows him in the first place. And I know that we did cover that like once or twice, but it's not something I fucking like lay on the table every fucking time I see him, you know, like this. Everybody thank Brandon for this. Yeah, I make sure that he prays like he blesses me when he eats his food. That's it's not like that, but I, I could, but I'm just kidding. I'm not that fucking vain. I'm fucking pretty legit. Well, yeah, he was kind of saying that it was someone years, maybe your baby mama or sister, baby mom, sister worked with you, the guy happening. No, I, I don't know if there's no females between me and him, but I did tell him that's what I said. I said, well, no, I just kind of actually just asked him about it. And it sounds like he used to work with them or work with someone or someone on someone on someone. I sit down the line, but I don't think it was the baby mom or sister or whatever. I think it was him is what my understanding. And I said, not that he tells her I pry too much or try, you know, like, but I can't, I don't, I don't really know where he's going with that. He could be talking about Gabby because I know that Gabby's met him like once or twice. Maybe that's, but I don't think I don't really, I don't really, I can't really tell what it was that he's describing without hearing it from him, I guess maybe but I did like speak very highly of you. I'm like, basically you know, I don't know if she was out I consider her my like my partner but like not so much because whatever she's doing her own thing, but you know, I I'm not she's getting my price because I like support her and we support each other. I don't know. I'm not worried very well, but I was like I can't, I can't show my love for her in time, but this is like another way of doing it. I don't know what the I don't know how I worried. I'll fucking show you the recordings but I know all I know is like I am giving putting you your ass on a pedestal and I better never hear that shit about Oh, there's too many people coming over to my house like if anybody's coming over your house you there's going to be people coming over your house but I'm always going to be the one that you want to see I mean, I mean like that's the way I feel like it should be right. I mean because it was awkward for me to think like when I left I mean I didn't call like somebody else like another friend of mine that's in the area and like she just I don't know like she's like happy to see me. She'll drop whatever she's doing and like whatever she's doing and she's like, yeah, I'm right here blah blah and it's always like really like pleasant to see her Yeah, I don't know. I was like I just wasn't that I just got super paranoid I don't know and that's crazy because my kids are with my kids I mean I wanted I wanted to hold on Okay Okay Okay Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah",

    "transcript": "What up, buddy? How's it going? Good. So, I never received that email last night. I figured I'd let you know this and I was wondering if we can meet at the county when you want to meet because I'm going down to the county and figuring out what's going on with my stuff. You got to go to a different county, you said? No, I'm going to Stern County but I gotta go all the way to the Wade Park office. Oh, to like go in person or whatever? Because I can't I can't take another night like this. Without my meds, without my, I can't pay my phone bill, I can't do nothing because they're taking their sweet old time and having their thumbs up their asses. So, I'm going to go expedite my case and I'm going to bring my dog with too. Yeah, that's what the BHF is for. Yeah, I think we should do that in person, dude. I'm fine with that. You don't know how to get a hold of your, you don't know how to, you don't have the phone number for your worker, though? Oh, yeah, my worker's a team and they never call me back. Stern County, you don't have county workers, you have teams. You're talking about for your medical, though? I'm talking not only for my medical but for my cash and everything. Because they took my medical, they took my food, and they took my cash. So, I'm gonna go request to speak to a supervisor and if that supervisor does not get the shit done, I'm gonna let my dog free in the county. Yeah, maybe you shouldn't bring your dog, but. Oh, hell yeah, I'm bringing my dog because they're gonna show, it's gonna show that it's not only affecting me, but it's affecting my dog, too. But yes, I can meet with you. I'm also, yeah, I also got some paperwork for you to look at about the whole thing. But yeah, I totally understand not having your meds is really gotta be getting to you. Well, not only that, but the doctors that prescribed me my medication told me if I don't get on my insurance soon, she's gonna take me off the shot. Right. Yeah, yeah, this BHF thing is, uh, I don't know why the first shouldn't send it to you. Yeah, I stayed up until like three o'clock waiting for a thing. I haven't even went to bed yet. I've been up all night. But I'm gonna catch the bus to the county, and then do you want me to just call you? Actually, how about this? If you just hang tight, I'll put you on a three-way call, and I'll, because they just, their offices just opened up right now. So, hold on a second. Okay. Yeah, yeah. So, you don't even got to stress, but you do got to kind of stay on the phone. Okay. And watch what, watch what happens. You're gonna get voicemail after 45 minutes. But go ahead. I'll wait. Okay. All right. Brief hold. Starting. Oh, fuck. They don't. All right. It says they open at 830. So, let me just give you a call back in 20 minutes, okay? All right. I'll give you a call back in like 15 minutes. All right. Bye. Bye-bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Hello. Hi. So, I just got a call from Anthony. Yeah. And he says, I am terminating the services. I said, okay. Yeah. And he said, he said he would be here in an hour. I said, okay, I didn't know that you guys talked and was planning on doing something. Wow. No communication. And then he hung up on me. Yeah, he's freaking out. I just, I'm just getting into town now. I was on the phone with Miles. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I couldn't like get off the phone, but. Well, the thing is, you also added fuel to this fire because you told him what I told you yesterday about the appointments. About what? What do you mean? That you told him that you were told that you have to go pick up Fred first. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that causes conflict. I don't know. Did I say something? I did say something. I don't know. Well, obviously you did because it's right on the nose and this is what's being said to me. And a conversation between you and I stays between you and I. If you need to tell your clients something else, don't say you have to go pick up Red or another client by name. For one, that's HIPAA. For two, it's best to just word it as in, I have an emergency with a client right now I have to deal with, but I will come back to you after I get done with that or else we can reschedule. Oh, I guess I didn't even fully comprehend because, you know, Anthony knew that I wasn't like, I didn't have like an appointment with him or anything like that. I wasn't planning on spending any time with him. I was just going to give him like a ride from like his house to the gas station. That was it. We weren't going to do anything more than that. Well, he, I think, took it as in, I got pushed to the back burner for Red. So I do want to point, he's, he called me this morning at 7, like 7 a.m. this morning and we've just been like furious, flipping out. And I've been able to like try to keep him calm. And then like, and then I like basically went and dropped my kids off and did everything I had to do with him in my ear while I called the county, the DHS again. And yeah, yeah, but just like at one point I had to get off the phone with him and he's like cursing Heidi's name. And I, some, because he didn't get this right the first time, but, but my point is, is like he's just fired up and I'm not, I wouldn't really take anything that he says right now very seriously just because he's, I mean, he's, yeah, I mean, he's experiencing, he's going through it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, so I don't know. I apologize. I wouldn't, I wouldn't let anything. I am, yeah, I don't mean to have him throw heat your way. I just wouldn't take it very seriously. Right. But I mean, what I'm trying to point out here is this all could have been avoidable. You know what I mean? Okay. You're right. I totally, you're absolutely right. I didn't think that that was going to be a thing and I should have thought about it. And if he wanted to ride down to the County, he knows that I have admin time, two hours a day, nine to 11. I can take them in those times. You know, I've done a lot for Anthony. Heck, I went out to Clearwater twice for him. Friday, you know what I mean? Not billable at nine o'clock at night. Right. So I'm just, I'm a little bit frustrated for this situation. Yeah. Because now he's mad at me because I didn't know that you were coming over to meet up with him and we have no communication. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I haven't had been able to get back to anybody cause I was like, Miles called me and yeah, I wasn't, I would've called, I would've called Anthony like as soon as I got back on the road, but since Miles, you know, he called me and I didn't know what it was for and yeah, I can't just, Hey, but I, I'm sorry. I'll apologize on my behalf and also on Anthony's behalf. You do work super hard for everybody around here and you don't deserve to be talked to you like that. I mean, I get it and it's a rookie mistake. Just know that if we have conversations between ourselves, don't have the same conversation with the client. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I know that him and Red have like had slight differences lately, so I knew to keep them like separate and like try to advocate that they get along and, you know, do the mature thing. And I did say something to both of them to that nature, but I, but yeah, I apologize. I could have done better. And I mean, it's up to you if you want to try reaching out to Anthony and take him to the County. I mean, I'm for getting him down to the County. You know what I mean? It's just, I mean, I could, I, because I have a, I actually do have like an appointment. I'm supposed to be at a certain time. All I could do is pick him up and drop him off. And I've been like, and my game plan was to try to keep him super calm because he's actually, I don't know, the shit that he's saying is not, he doesn't have his meds. He's been off his meds for a while. And if they don't fucking tell me what I want to hear, I'm releasing the dog in the office. I'm like, no, you're not dude. That's not right. So, all right. Well, keep me updated. Okay. All right. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hello. This is Mary. Hi, Brandon. Yeah, it's Mary. How are you doing today? I'm getting a little stressed out, but nothing beyond the norm. Would it be good if I came and got Zach and Bear for a day or two? What do you think, Zach? That sounds good to you? Yeah, Zach's game. Yeah, I'm actually at one of the homeless shelters up here, the nicer one right now. I just did a tour here yesterday, and a tour of the other place. I know that they can have dogs, and I think Zach would like it. Also, because he's in recovery with me, he doesn't have to, because usually people have to sit on the floor on a mat the first night they get here while they're doing paperwork. But if they're in recovery, then they get a room right away. That's just for the day or two. They're also doing open enrollment for an HRA program up here, and I wanted to enroll him in the program and see if we can get him some housing out here. That would be awesome to get him some HRA. Yeah, I know. It is an amazing program to be on. I couldn't do it without it. Yeah, I know. It's a blessing. It's really good. Yeah. It's kind of funny. He doesn't actually fully know that that's what my plan is yet, because I haven't really had a chance to talk to him completely. I'm sorry, Brandon. I thought you knew. He's standing right here. Oh, no, no. I know that he's standing in front of you. It's kind of... Yeah, yeah. Thank you for looking out for him. Thank you for looking out for him, of course. We were worried for a minute. I was like, oh, did he die or did he get hit by a car? We're always worried about Zach. Yeah, I can understand that. Yeah. Well, how have you been, though? You've just been kind of tired and making it through your appointments and everything. No, I was sick last weekend. I missed a couple of big appointments, but I've rescheduled one and working on rescheduling the other. Yeah. Yeah, making appointments is hard for me. The medical gets overwhelming sometimes. Yeah. So, I mean, I know that I've heard a bunch of stuff talk, like, from Zach and, like, I've never really directly talked with you about it, but I know that you guys were trying to get a new PCA. I am, yeah. You know, like, that I'm kind of like a PCA, but I'm not a PCA, but I'm that person for Zach. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. That's what those initials meant, right? The CNS or whatever it was. Yeah, CPRS, yeah. DPRS, okay. Yeah, I guess if that crossed my mind, like, I know that you really do need to make those appointments, all those things, but if you are having a struggle with getting PCA services, you might be easier getting, like, a CPRS like me, like, somebody from my office to come and work with you and tell you, again, they can get all those other things set up. They're kind of like an arms worker, but we're just way cooler. I have an arms worker, and I would have to agree. Yeah, honestly, like, I know, like, how much work and how many things I do for people, and, like, I don't know, I wish, I mean, I'm pretty sure a PCA and, like, an arms worker, like, all those people are supposed to be, like, as helpful as I am, but I don't think I've ever heard anybody doing all the things that we do. Right. Well, if you could help Zach get that HRA, that would be awesome. Hell yeah. All right, that'll work out good. All right, well, it was good talking with you. I'll try calling back again and hitting up Zach. He's right here. Well, my appointment's about to start. I was about to head out to go buy a fucking charging cord. It's shocking. I know. All right, all right. Zach's talking, Brandon. Yeah, I know, I know, I know. Okay. All right, I'll talk to you. Give me a call back when you get back in the area. I probably won't be picking you up until tomorrow night, or Friday night, I mean. Okay. Okay. All right, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.",

I have to wait for my insurance to be active. She's basically told me that she'll try to expedite it, but she can't make any guarantees because it goes with the way that the applications come in. I'm just looking at... Yeah, that's frustrating. If that's fucking accurate, I'm really frustrated. But I do know that, like, why...

I'm, like, what's on your mind, like, if you can talk to me about whatever you want, you know, even if you think it's going to make me, like, weird or mad, like, you know, I know you love me, and I know you, whatever, and then, uh, I finally got her to say it, and then, uh, she basically explained to me that, um, she's, like, do you remember, like, when we were really young, and you, like, got mad, and you, like, grabbed me by the throat, and, like, like, threw me on the bed, and I was, like, yeah, I remember that, and she's, like, I was just kind of wondering why you, like, never brought that up or never said sorry or anything. And I was, like, I was, like, well, honestly, it's because I kind of was hoping you had forgotten it ever happened. Yeah. And then I, um, and then, uh, yeah, so that conversation, you know, it developed, you know, I wanted it to be, uh, better than the, that version that I had with my dad, so I knew, like, what to say, and I told her all the, you know, no, yeah, I was hoping you didn't remember that, and I was, that was not okay of me to do, and, like, and there's no way I could ever explain anything to you that's gonna make it sound like, uh, it's, I was, I was in the right for doing that, and you deserve that, and I was, like, you just deserve that, you mean a lot, and, uh, you know, and it, and she's, like, and I was like, if you ever want to know, like, this isn't an excuse, but if you ever want to know why that may have happened, like, it has to do with, like, kind of what happened to me when I was a kid, and. Wow. And, um, yeah, it was just, it turned out to be a good conversation, though, like, uh, she's happy, I mean, I said all the right things. Aw, that's good. That's a tough conversation to have. It was. I mean, it is. It's awkward. I mean, I mean, because I think there's so many situations where parents these days are like, oh, shit, I'm not, I think it's about this meme, and it's like, when you, like, try to bring up past trauma to your mom, who's like, I didn't do that. I didn't. I don't, I can't remember. I'm going to have to find that fucking meme, but, yeah. Deny it? Hmm? Or, yeah, they try to deny it. Yeah, yeah, it's like, I'm going to fucking, I'm going to send, I'll send this meme to you after fucking, you probably start your break, your break's done or something, but, Uh, yeah, let's see what else weird shit do I got going on. Uh, that, like, all this work stuff that's going on weird, and then this hanging, wanting to fucking sleep with you and fucking go do all my druggy things, I guess that's about as crazy as it gets. Hmm. Yeah, I am. You're funny. Oh, sorry, I'm just trying to relax. You know, a lot of fucking, a lot of drama going on, which is good, like, I just want to not have to deal with these people anymore, so I'm glad the drama is going on where I don't have to talk to them. The drama, like, um, with some of the people that are picking up from you or something? Well, that, and then, like, guys that want to sleep with me. Mm-hmm. That I just would never, wouldn't want. Yeah. Um, and they just don't get it, but I'm, like, such a good person that I, like, still try to help them out, and I try to be there for them, and, like, you know, like, I just gave this guy a ride home yesterday, been stranded at his cousin's house for, like, a week. I drove all the way from Minneapolis to go to, to drive him home, um, when I didn't have time for that, and I just did that, and he keeps, like, you know, making passes, like, he wants to sleep with me, and I keep telling him, like, he's, like, you know, good friends with one of my exes, and I just told him, like, it's not right, I don't feel right about it, and instead of respecting my boundaries, he just keeps going, and, and so he said something today, like, something about, oh, I'll give you a back massage or something, and I said, not a chance, slow dance, and then he just started going off on me, and I'm, like, you know what, fuck you, dude. Yeah. That's, I'm sorry to hear that. That is, like, you want to hang out with people because, like, you, you adore the friendship, but then you kind of find out that it's, like, oh, I'm just a fuck, a fuck boy, or I'm a fuck toy? Yeah, you want to hang out with me just to fuck me? Yeah, that bugs me. That happens to me a lot. Yeah. Well, it just hurts, because, like, I just, like, you know, I don't like rejection, and I don't, whatever, and I want to be friends, and, and when it comes to being, like, only, they're only being friends with me for... Their chance to hit it? Yeah, their idea. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I, it is a, you are very good looking, though, and you are very, just, a nice, you're, I don't know, you're kind of, like, like, honey. I don't know. Sweet, but sticky? Yeah, yeah. That's exactly what I was thinking. But I, I do, I'm sorry that you had to experience that. Yeah, it's all good, it's just, it's irritating. It's your cross to bear, I know. But anyway. Yeah, I'm, I'm actually just about to start doing this diagnostic for this person, and... Okay. And, yeah, I think I might be coming through the area sometime, fucking, eventually, I don't know, tonight or something, no, not tonight, tomorrow, after tomorrow, right? Oh, yeah, yeah, so the meeting went really well. Yeah. He completely knew, like, I didn't want to tell him about, like, my Margellons. Uh-huh. And he started asking me, like, why I had a microscope and stuff, and... Yeah. And I was, yeah, you know, and I just gave him a little tidbit of it, and he was just like, oh, yeah, I know, you know, like, I think he might have it, but not, like, as extreme as I do, but, like, he notices the same things I do, and only people that, like, have this disease know that. Yeah. Yeah, so, yeah, kind of bonded over that, I guess, and that probably made him feel a lot worse. I mean, he'll never probably admit it, that he has it, or whatever, but, like, he sees things move, just like I do. Yeah. Wow. And his mom is, like, something, some sort of a nurse or something, and... Yeah. Is she hot? Yeah, totally, just kidding. No, no, no, but she, like, studied, like, drugs and its effects and stuff like that, and I guess... Yeah, I guess, like, they both were, like, interested into this, like, more jealous thing, and... Yeah. So, it was just cool that he knew about it, and he didn't judge me over it, and, yeah, it was cool. So, I kind of gave him a little insight, and I was like, I'm sorry, this is probably the last thing you want to, you know, this is the last thing I definitely wanted to tell you, or thought this meeting was going to go, or how this meeting was going to go. Yeah. Yeah, no, I just, you can be, like, self-conscious about it, but I'm glad that you made me feel comfortable. I don't know if that's, like, the last conversation you want to have with somebody you just meet, like, everybody's leaving, and you're, like, now you have, like, I don't know, or it's, like, now you have to collab. I don't know. I've had that conversation with other people in the past, and those are awkward conversations. Sorry, yes, I actually, I don't know why I just said that. That joke was not really that great, but I am about to start getting this thing started, so let me give you a call back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, God, I got to get going. I don't know why my break went by so fast. Yeah. Okay. Good talking to you, though. Okay. All right, bye-bye. Bye.",

Oh, I was just kind of bent to kind of laugh, chuckle about something real quick. Okay, let me, I'm in the room by myself. You say you are? I mean, yeah. Um, yeah, yeah, I, well, I was kind of referring to both Anthony, um, I was trying to kind of still help him out over the phone, like, even though, I, like, right after I dropped off Janelle at her appointment, and I totally understand Anthony's, like, kind of getting, like, a little ball of energy, frustrated, and, uh, he just, like, blew up, and he's like, you're fired. Like, I don't know if you can fire me, because, like, I'm not getting paid to help you do this, you know? Just relax. Right. Right. Oh, yeah, he came in here just now, and was like, I want to speak to her supervisor, or her, her company, and make sure that nobody's filling for me, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And I said, Anthony, you're more than welcome to come down and look at my computer. I'm not coming down there, and just totally fucking blew up on me, and so I took my computer up there. I said, last time that you were billed for was on December 15th, when we went to the food shelf, and then you found out that you didn't have insurance. I said, nobody has billed for you since. I said, so if you have a problem with me, and want to address it with me, you know where my office is. Otherwise, I would be more than happy to give you my supervisor's information. I mean, does he have, like, is there, like, I don't really know how that works. Well, yeah, because he's always going to be, like, we always have to maintain that professional thing, of course. But, like, I was kind of thinking to myself, like, if we're not getting paid for helping him, and we're helping him, could we get control for that? I don't think so. I mean, I guess if we were, obviously, if we had done something wrong in the process, then we're still, like, guilty. But, we're actually kind of just doing him a solid. Right. And that's what I said to him. I said, you know, I said, whatever I've done has only been to try to help you. I said, so you can take that, and do what you want with it. But, I'm not going to sit down here and listen to him upstairs, freaking talking shit, either. He's like, okay, Heidi. Yeah, yeah. That's crazy. I didn't know that he came, so he, like, walked there, I suppose. He said at some point he got it figured out. I mean, so I don't know if he means, like, he's going to get it figured out on his own, and we don't have to help him figure it out. That definitely would have worked out for me. That was the way it was, I guess. From moving forward, don't even reach out to him. If he wants to calm down, and he wants to reach back out to us, then so be it. But, we're not doing anything for him from this point on. And, even if he does reach out, if he doesn't have insurance, and he's not billable, then we do not help him. Right. If he wants me to take him during my admin time, I would be willing to do that. But, we're not just doing it on our own time. I have to take this phone call. Okay. I'll talk to you later. I'll call you back.",

Nothing, I just got done with work and I went and I had a chance to check out that guy's vehicle that he wants me to do the work and, yeah, but I just wanted to give you a call. How are things going there? Fine, went and picked them up from daycare, made some quesadillas, Alex ate a peanut butter and jelly before I could finish making the quesadilla, so he didn't really eat too much of it, but Atlas ate a little bit of it. Yeah, and then I folded my laundry, I still need to put it away, and then I have to fold your laundry, and that's pretty much what I did all day. Well, what time do you got to work tomorrow? 10 to 4. And where? What town, what city? Monticello. 10 to 4. Yeah. One of my new clients has got a court date tomorrow, and I don't think there's anybody else in the office that is available to drive her there, and it's out in Meeker County, which is basically in, like, Litchfield, basically in, like, fucking Waverly is where I got to take her. At what time? Uh, court is at, uh, see the, uh, it's at 1.30, yeah. Okay. I mean, just based off of the, if you work in Monticello, you get off at 4. You said, you did say 4, right? Yeah. Yeah, so 2.30, 3.30 to get, uh, fucking, yeah, yeah, that checks out. I just, uh, I'm gonna be very on a tight schedule, otherwise, if, uh, if I got out of the if, uh, if I got out of the, we got done with court at 2.30, that would mean that you'd basically be waiting there, like, 10 minutes after your shift is done, but if I get out at, like, I don't know, I guess Meeker County. Like, that all sounds, like, fine, I guess, but I don't know, I'm gonna have to, like, call or, like, talk to my mom tonight and see if she could pick up the kids then, because, like I said, tomorrow's Thursday, someone has to pick them up by, like, 3.30. Yeah. And now it sounds like if we were, if you were running a little late, like, even if we did commence the daycare, like, we have to pick them up by 5.30, and if I'm, if you're running late, like, we're running late, like, we wouldn't get there until, like, 5.20 or something, 5.30. Yeah. Let's see. Dude, I might, we might, I might have to have, like, Kiana come and meet up with me tonight, because she doesn't work tomorrow. What, what's she gonna do for you? Watch the, like, kids. What do you mean, watch the kids? Do you know anybody else that's gonna, like, watch the kids? And I know that she's not working tomorrow, so. Well, where do you expect her to watch the kids? I just fucking, you know what, it's not my fucking problem, you figure it out, it's my first idea, and I like it so far, so if you have questions, maybe call her. I'll just ask my mom. No, I'll just ask my mom, because. That's fine, all right, bye. All right, when are you gonna be home? That's a good question. According to this fucking work that I'm supposed to do on this thing, it's supposed to be, like, it should be, like, like, along with having to go pick up parts, like, it should take me, like, three hours, like, maybe two and a half. Okay, I thought you said you weren't gonna do the work today. I wasn't planning on it, but it's, like, really much more simple than I thought it was going to be, so. Yeah, but I'm, whatever, I'm not even gonna say my comment, but. What? I mean, I would reconsider that, Brennan, it's getting dark, and you think that every time you're gonna do a car thing, you're like, oh, yeah, it's gonna be super simple, and then you're out until, like, three in the morning, and you're like, that was way harder than I thought. Yeah, I mean, that is a good point, but I guess I, although I sent the guy the price of the parts and all that shit, I need to hear him say, like, yes, I want to do that tonight, and, yeah, he, so, yeah, I just, but I just wanted to give you a call and kind of find out how you were doing, and I don't know, for some reason, I guess I like talking to you, but, you know, every time I talk to you, I get reminded that you're difficult. All right, all right, I'll let you get going. All right, well, don't forget, you have kids. They miss you. Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, clearly, Alex was, like, freaking out every time you left the room last night. Yeah, I miss him, too. All right, well, yeah, I'll try to figure something out, hopefully, mom, when she gets home. All right, just be, just be, like, oh, please, please, please, please, mom, oh, I'll do anything, I'll do anything, I'll make Brandon do the dishes. I'll do your laundry. I'm just kidding, I'm sorry. I mean, to me, that sounds like an opportunity to, like, the boys can go hang out with the girls for the day. All right, I gotta get going, so, because I don't want to just drive around St. Cloud. I gotta call this guy and figure out, oh, all right, he's texting me now. All right, bye. Bye.",

Yeah. Yeah, because basically we we finance this thing. So Yeah, yeah Logically, I'm I've been using my brain all day long. So you have to excuse me But something logically if you were to do want to do this transaction if you were me, what would you do? What would I do? I would Yeah, if you were me, how are you I would sell that outright get my money for That way you're not losing any money at all because you said oh like five grand, right? Yeah, we put yeah, we put down like I think we put down like seven or eight and I think we still owe like Yeah, I think yeah, five four or five grand left is what we owe. Yeah, so In reality, yes, I'll take it But you got to think about the negative equity that you're going to be rolling over into the new loan Yeah, right, right. It's like when the cars were five grand five six thousand You can get that sell it pay off the loan to old loan And just have a new loan. So you're not you're not really rolling any negative equity I mean give you the best deal in the city for sure. Anyway, you can't let I'll be basically up charging a vehicle to to pay off that car for you If that makes sense Right. Yeah So it's like you're better off just paying the car off Um Yeah, that's what I was gonna say Paying the car off Um Do you guys have a bank you guys deal with or um, I think I can't remember who she got the financing through. I don't think she like went through like Her own bank or anything. I think it was like the financing company that the dealership offered Okay, does she she has decent credit there? Uh, yeah, but we actually also did get a co-signer though Oh, she had to get co-signer. Yeah her mom. Okay, so That might change now because she's been paying alone so yeah Yeah, she's made every single payment like super on time like she's fucking yeah, she's a she's a Yeah, um anyways, she's she's responsible with her money it's not like all rambunctious like me All right Yeah, I can definitely get you guys into something um That is just the finance part Um, what I can do is I can see um What I can do is I can actually run her credit see uh, well, I don't know if whatever you guys want to do um So this is what you should do yeah, tell me what I should do like because okay so Go on my website, right? Apply for a loan That way I can see Exactly what we're working with And it doesn't have to be the specific car on there I can use it for another vehicle if that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah so That's what we should do Because that that'll put you ahead of the game and then you're already locked in with a finance I can see what I can get you approved for And then how much you got to put down And what exact card that you want Okay and then um, I know that she's gonna she's gonna fucking say this to me like um How long is that uh approval or like uh, if we were to get 90 days? 90 days Okay, and so she keeps on saying like brendan.

I think the way the whole billing is set up Altogether is actually the problem Because oh for sure Honestly like the way that they because if somebody like The way we've been taught like all health care providers Like if you go to counseling whatever a doctor like they just like make a record that you went there and this Is what you were seen for? But like if you as a patient were to like challenge that and say like I never did that like then there's like a whole fucking investigation and like if you don't have if that Provider doesn't have like some supporting documents other than them just recording it like you could get them for fraud Oh, yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, so the company I work for is called generation hope and Like we so we bill like normal, but then we also have like a third party like software that like cross-references like the information that we put in there, so Yeah, so if somebody asks like hey, did you do this and yeah, I don't know but that's Yeah, so that's kind of what i've learned but i'll uh, i'm gonna did you text me that address uh Yeah, I did. Yep. All right, cool i'm gonna send it out to gabby and uh And you said even if the vehicle that we don't we don't even if we don't see a vehicle on there.

Like, he doesn't speak English, of course, you know, so we usually get a video and he's like, he's like, Hey, what's up, my brother? And then like, we try to say, like, like, I instantly forget that he doesn't understand English. And, and then we have to basically get off the phone. But I was just I'm still trying to get him to do another video call with me. Because like, I was like, I'll pull over. I'll do like, I have my phone listen on a different device. And like, I don't know, but I don't think I'm really selling it to him. But I was asking fucking AI, I'm like, what, what's the fucking best way to do this, like without fucking having to reinvent the wheel. And it's like, if you have a tablet, and you have a phone in your hand, you can take a video call on a tablet and have the phone, like, like on the Google translator. And as long as the phone can hear what's coming in on the tablet, like, it'll get translated and he'll hear it. And I was like, yeah, I guess that makes sense. Are you at the grocery store? I am at the grocery store. Getting daddy some groceries. Oh my gosh. But you're not referring to me. So that's a terrible fucking concept. Whatever. You got, you know, a couple of homies. No, I'm on a strict nobody over rule. Yeah. After except for I mean, you're you're welcome. Wait a second. Are you coming on to me? Because I am fucking, you know, listen here, motherfucker. Either with the program or you're not. I fucking am. And that's what I'm saying. I keep on trying to warn you like, I'm like, what do you call it? I'm like on a dry spell. Yeah. And I don't fucking like a vampire. And if I don't fucking like, it's gonna be weird. It's not gonna be weird. It's just gonna be like, be like, really? Bang the shit out of you. It's gonna be like an out-of-body experience. Oh, my God. I'm spending so much money at the grocery store right now. But I don't even care. Never come here hungry. And I always come here hungry. Yeah. OK. Where are you? Or what are you doing? What's your deal? That's a good question. I was going to sit in St. Cloud and if I can do that auto part, auto repair work. But I would much rather go and see you and fucking. But I was just told that I do have to be in Mora in the morning, which is fucking kind of stupid. And I'm like, you know what? Yeah. So, I mean, if I come over. I'm getting way too much food. If I come over tonight, I got to leave like early as fuck in the morning. Like. This isn't going to fit in my freezer. But I can come over tomorrow night after work. And then I don't have to actually. Actually, that's kind of what I was planning on doing was tomorrow night. Because I'm going to go all the way. Oh, OK. Yeah. Well, hey, listen, I want to meet half a. So. Yeah. I got up. Oh, yeah. Maybe if you can. And. If I can. What. Yes. I was going to tell you. Can I call you back? Yeah. Yeah.

The one that's in the laptop, you... God, I can hear him freaking out. The one that's in the laptop, you could, uh, uh, put into the thing. But you gotta put the fucking movie on there. I don't know how to do that. Oh my gosh, you're, you're all hopeless. Whatever, I never had to do that. I don't know how to do that. Yeah, yeah, you're, I don't know what you're gonna do. Whatever. If anyone else said that to you, you'd be like, oh, I'm so sorry. I should show you how to do that, shouldn't I? That was so rude of me to just assume you know how to do that. Stop yelling at me. Uh, no, that's okay. I kind of forgot that you, you're not capable of learning new things. You never showed me and I've never had to do it. So how the hell am I supposed to know how to do it? That's the stupidest thing to think that people just know how to do things when they've never been shown or taught. Well, the thing is that you're, if you're not willing to try, then you're probably not going to figure it out anyways. Well, I'm willing to try if I fucking, you want me to YouTube this while a kid is yelling at me? That's fucking dumb. You think I have the fucking patience to stay here and try to learn how to do something while a kid is yelling at me to fucking hurry the fuck up? I don't think you have the patience or the like the fucking confidence to stick with it for five minutes. So I'll be there in a half hour. All right. Sounds good. Did you get my text about the fucking dinner? No. What about dinner? I just said that there's like some French fries and there's like two chicken sandwich patties we could have. What's two French fries and two patties? No, there's a bag of French fries and there's like two of those chicken patties like to make chicken sandwiches. So you're saying I gotta get some more patties or sunset or I could get a, one of those fucking burgers from holiday. I don't want to pass. And then, uh, then we'd be good. I guess if that's sure. Would you talk to your brother and you say happy birthday or your dad? Oh shit. What day is it? Is it the eighth? It's his fucking birthday today, bro. No, is it? I thought it was tomorrow. I don't know. I just seen a notification come across my phone from Angelo that said happy birthday copy or something. I'm going to look it up because I'm pretty sure it's tomorrow, but yeah, I know it's coming up too. Um, yeah, it is tomorrow. So I just said tomorrow. Yeah. You said today, Angelo said today. I said, I gotta look it up. Okay. Well, yeah, no, my brother actually texted me this morning. It was like his mom's birthday on the ninth. I was like, no, it's on the 13th. So I have to remember that too. Good thing nobody cares. What? I'm just kidding. She has a birthday. I thought she was like grown or something or like created or I don't even know. Oh yeah. I'm going to run into this place and you think my GPS says like 25 minutes away or some shit. And I also, I don't know where the f**k my Dave card went. The last time I saw it was in your wallet. Yeah, that's kind of where I was thinking too, but I don't know if I put it in like my, one of my coats, but that is on the docket to find that. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Dude, the car just did that thing again, only worse. Why? Uh, well, I just, um, now, I don't know, dude, actually, um, so it's something worse is happening right now. Are you still driving or did you pull over? Yeah, no, I had to pull over. Like, um, um, I had to pull over because I was in, I put the truck, the car in limp mode and on a, you know, where you're going out of Mora towards like down 23 and you take a left to go to fucking Anoka. Yeah. Uh, I'm at that fucking little business right before that left. Yeah. Um, but like, so I pulled in, you know, turned around and I got like no power steering. And then, uh, typically when that happened in the past, I would just fucking shut the vehicle off, you know, let it sit for a second and, uh, you know, I would start it back up and then it would fucking be okay. But this time, this time when I started off and I tried to start it back up, like the dash just like flashed and then like it, like, I don't know, there's like no power, like it's killing the power to this ignition right now, which is, um, uh, not gonna allow me to start the vehicle, but I'm going to give it another try to hopefully just back to normal. Yeah. Oh my gosh, dude. Yeah. It looks like the fucking, it looks like the fucking, uh, you had a fucking power steering light and that's back to normal now. So it's cool now you're going to be able to get home. Uh, yeah. I mean, I was a little fucking freaked out there for a second because it got, I've never seen it do that before. Well, I've had to do that before. Like when I had, when I took it to the dealership and I had them replace the fucking whatever the chip or whatever it was called. Cause when I was driving once it, like the power steering went out and the like speedometer just went to zero or like it didn't, it didn't go to zero, but it stayed at a certain number. And then it was like, yeah, it said three, but like it was whatever speed I was going, but it didn't go down when I started slowing down or speeding up. Like it just stayed at whatever number it was. Yeah. I think I know what you're talking about, but yeah, that's what happens. Like when it goes into limp mode, like it'll go to third gear and like when you push your foot on the gas, like it'll kind of sound like you're, it'll give you, it will give you a little bit more speed, but like really puts the RPMs up and then like it's that's limp mode. Yeah. So what are we going to have to do to fix that? The reason why the way limp mode works is like if the car detects that there's some significant issue going on, like maybe it's like your oil pressure sensor light, like which is the same exact thing. I had, I was talking to you on that guy's car, or basically you got to fix what it is, whatever it is that is making that happen, because it's causing it to go into limp mode because the car, the car automatically puts itself in limp mode whenever it is seen, it seen errors come up that could become catastrophic. Okay. So it's trying to protect itself. So it does that? Yes. So that the user doesn't blow up the car. Okay. Well, I guess we've got to figure out what the fuck that means, fix that before our only other car goes out. I just wanted to kind of let you know, because I thought you were going to have to fucking come pick me up for a second. Okay. Well, drive safely. Yeah. All right. Bye.",

Yeah, honestly, I drive all the way out there if you want, but you just got to tell me how much you have, I guess, or whatever my options are. And whatever you need.

Yeah, I need to get some of what you have. Almost everything. When I was there, we're not interested in the math right now. No, tonight is a blow night. Well, you can pretend that for you. I got some weed and I got some DMT, too. You guys might be stuck out here. I don't actually have a real ID or a password on me, and I don't want to get caught by ICE. So I don't know if that's a good idea. Oh, what color are you? He keeps on calling me Ben Affleck. And then I look over and I'm like, you know who you look like? You look like Matt Damon. And now that I said that, when you meet up with us, I want you to tell me if he's got a Matt Damon vibe. Okay, yeah. I most definitely won't agree because I can't let anything go to this man's head ever. Well, does he at least look like Ben Affleck? Yeah, do you think I look like Ben Affleck? He does. No, you look like trash. I'm just kidding. You got to kick him down. I'm just kidding. No, you're gorgeous. You know that. Me? Yeah, you, Ben. Yeah, you. I don't know. Yeah, thank you. I don't know the other guy. I can't be targeting him like that. You haven't met him, so it makes sense. Just look up. If you go on Pornhub and you look up the, like, three most recent videos, I'm in two of them. Oh, yeah. I'm the white guy. No, I'm not. In the porno videos? No, I'm not. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just drunk. We won $1,000 tonight on poll taps. Oh, good. Good. Whenever I hang out with Zach here, it's the only time of the year that I gamble. He has such a crazy, intense energy when it comes to gambling. I become the student. What did you call me earlier? Like, you're the number guy. You're the number guy. Holy shit. I do my best. One through ten, buddy. One through ten. So, Becky, I know you have to be at work in the morning and all that. I can't stay out at night. So what do you want me to do? Well, you can come here. I need to be in bed by midnight, 1 o'clock at the latest. I almost did not get up. I stayed up until 1 o'clock last night. I almost didn't get up for work. Yeah, that's bad. Well, see, here's the thing. Zach is an aversion. He's afraid of the substance called methamphetamine. He's not stupid. He knows that I dabble from time to time. Well, I used to shoot it up. And now that I stopped shooting it up, I'm afraid to do it ever again. Because I'm afraid that I'll just shoot it up again. Unless you have needles. Oh, God, shut up. No, I'll never condone that. Well, I'm just fucking sound. Don't fucking tell her. I'm a crazy guy. I hate when you lie about me. I hate that shit. He's got so much energy and I don't. I'm about to fall asleep. I haven't done meth in a long time, like 4 or 5 years, so I'd really rather do coke. But when I get drunk, I'm down to do whatever. Yeah, I know. You should hear him when he's drunk. So when I did meth, I was an IV drug user. I got an aggravated robbery charge. I get off probation in 6 months. And the bottom line is, we don't need to go back down that path. Yeah, no, you're not getting any from me then. I would rather do coke than we could just suck each other. Good job. I gotcha. I gotcha. But if we had to, you could tell me that meth was coke, and that would be fine too. Well, that's very sincere. That's what I did just now. No, yeah, I'm a sincere guy. I don't mind if you lie to me. I'm actually fresh out. Yeah, if you smile and mix it up, I don't fucking know the difference. She's out of the meth though. Oh, good. That's a good one. Because you know what that means. She sold it all. You're not the devil anymore. Yeah. Are you a white girl? No, she's black. She's nothing but black. I'm looking at the picture right now. Only from the waist down. That's what I tell people. So we don't have to worry about you getting raided by ICE or anything? No, most definitely not. You guys raided me when you came to my country. You're a cheater. Girl, how do you like to drink alcohol, huh? I sure do. Because I'm mad at this guy. He's like, how am I going to do coke without beer? What? He's like, the liquor store is just closed. How am I going to do coke without beer? Do you have a couple? I have beer. Oh, thank you. I love you. I have cash. Yeah, but if you guys do come here. We're on our way. About how long is it going to take you to get here? We're in Ice Annie right now. 40 minutes. It'll probably be about 40. 57 minutes and 43 seconds. Dang, I'm good. Dang, I'm good. Okay, so I just ask one thing of you guys. When you're walking in my hallway, don't even say a word. Because I can already tell that the second you say a word, you guys are both going to be like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. I'm trying to keep my... Sorry, I'm going to keep talking. I can't hear you.

Absolutely, you are, and I encourage it, where the indulgence that I want to consume for the many forms of negotiation that can occur, I encourage to live a life of many, many routes taken. Oh, my gosh, that sounds really bad when you say it like that. What's the point of having to live a life that you never asked to live, when you can't put no life in it? Um, shit, I was actually just fucking pulling up. I gotta bring somebody to court today. And I'm not feeling very well after I stayed up kind of late. Whatever. I was gonna say, like, uh, so the fucking, what was I gonna say? So I was gonna do the HRA fucking enrollment thing. I enrolled somebody yesterday, and it was like an instant approval. And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like a little confused. I might have that instant approval, too, because not only have I been called in for HRA a couple years ago, where I got hit by a semi, so I missed my window going in there. But I already had been called in. I don't know whatever happened to that. But I also had my name called and been brought through the front door, open entry or front door, fucking whatever, coordinated entry, I think is what it is. And that was last year with retaking the phone and stuff. What are we talking about? That was a really long response. No, how your client got like already accepted or whatever. For HRA, I've had my name called on that, coordinated entry and front door. I had my name called on that. And then I did not let it get and stuff like that where I had this housing available for me. The lack of me. Hey, let me let me call you back. I'm just about to. I thought I could I would have enough time to do an application for you right now. But I my person just like walked outside. And so she didn't see me where I was parked. Whatever your traveling is, and if you are tired, I think I got a friend in Brainerd that needs her car like that with the radiator brakes and something else. Or she has a newborn baby. She doesn't, she's stressed out driving. Would not want to break down. Give me your phone number and then I'll give her a call. And if I'm if I'm trying to do it, I guess. I'm going to pass you through Facebook because that's how I'm communicating with her. And I'll ask her to pick you up. Like I said, she lives out in Brainerd. She was my one of my old plugs. Yeah, yeah. You might have introduced me to her. You know, just give me your number and I'll give her a call. But I got to get going now. Absolutely. Okay, I'll talk to you soon. Okay.

Well, you're basically halfway done. So then after court, you go drop her off and then you head over to me? Yeah. Okie dokie. Yeah, it's cold in here. And there's like this, I don't want to show it over here. There's this guy that like he's always shopping and like he lives in the trailer park next to the Walmart. He always comes through here and like one day I was just being nice and like, I don't know. I like start talking to him and then like now every time he sees me he comes and talks to me and he talked to me for like an hour and a half straight and I was like, I like made several excuses to like go do something and like he would still be here. And then finally I was like, I'm going to take my 30 minute break and I was like, I'm going to go get some lunch. And so I went and grabbed a salad and then when I got back, he wasn't here. So I was like, thank God. Throwing into somebody's trunk before the end of the day or what? Maybe, I don't know. I don't think he has a trunk. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My legs hurt like I can't even like bend over to grab something. I drop without my legs hurting. Yeah, your legs hurting. Yeah, that's kind of they might hurt for like a day or two. I'm still going to do some more tonight. So they're just going to keep hurting. Yeah. Gotta work through the pain. No, I haven't drinking any any Red Bulls or soda. I'm just drinking water. I don't know if this pasta salad that I got is actually healthy or not, but it was delicious and it was just a small pasta salad and then I got one of those immunity shots. Oh my God. All right. Good. Like a like a it's got like a fucking I can't remember what you call it. Yeah, like the like ginger and cayenne pepper and they're like spicy little shot glasses. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. How's your chick? Was she nervous to go to court? Like is it for something serious or? Yeah, I think this is for a fifth degree. Yeah. No, I can't remember. She said that this was for a theft or a fifth degree and I can't remember. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, I can't find my fucking the mouse anywhere in your mouth. The mouse is in the room. Oh, it is. Yeah, because remember we were using it to watch the movies last night and I remember I cut it on top of the keyboard and on top of the like heat the heater. It's next to the bed. Yeah. No, my mom like let me borrow these running shoes of hers. But like I think why she doesn't use them anymore is because like the back of it like was starting to come like open or something and like there's like I don't know if it's like a hard plastic or like a metal piece or what it would be but like it was rubbing the back of my ankle and now my ankle hurts. Yeah. That's terrible. That's not. Yeah. And I told her I was like, what can I put here? And she just said she would get me new tennis shoes. So I was like, cool. So who knows when she'll buy me new tennis shoes, but I can't quite hear you. Oh. I don't know. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hello. Yeah. So what do you just get to the same a second ago? I said that I messaged the daycare to let them know because well, I told I forget what her name is the lady that I was talking to. I said that I messaged the daycare to let them know because well, I told I forget what her name is the lady that I was talking to this morning because it wasn't Karen, but it was the other older lady that my mom is going to be picking up the boys at 345 today. And then I just made sure she remembered like I knew she remembered but kind of just messaged her like hey, I told the daycare you'd be there at 345. 345 because yeah, she's going to leave work at 3 I think and then it takes her like 20 minutes and then she has to go pick up the my brother's car. So hopefully they don't get to I mean, it's only like 15 minutes more because they say that they have to get picked up at 3. Because that's when everyone wakes up for naps and who knows maybe Alex will be awake and it won't even be a problem, but Who knows? Oh, I wish I was sitting in front of a heater right now. Yeah. Where you actually like right? Come by the front door or what? No, this place it's like in the middle like right by like where most like service desks are for Walmart like it's like in the middle by the registers and stuff but like this Walmart is just fucking cold all the time like no matter what season it is like they have like the AC on or something and it's because they don't have they don't have it on site the thermometer it's like at corporate or something like they don't have it on site. Like at corporate or something like it's not even controlled in this store. Yeah, so it's just freezing in here all the time. Yeah, that's kind of weird. I mean, I know that they like to be able to control that shit from like somewhere else, right? Yeah. Like why can't they be blasting the heat like it's winter time? It's cold. So that place doesn't have like the the registers that blow really hard when you walk in the front vestibule. Yeah, I mean they do there but that's like the only place that it's warm. It's like when you first walk in. Yeah. Like once you walk in it gets just like fucking cold. What am I gonna do? I don't know. Why don't you just sit there and close your eyes. I wish I could do. I made her drive. Oh, man, that breaks almost over. It's crazy how fucking fast 30 minutes goes when I'm sitting down and relaxing. But when it's just when I'm standing there doesn't go by that fast. You're sitting that goes by fast? Yeah. So what do you do? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What are you gonna do this evening? What do you mean? What am I gonna do this evening? What? What? You said like the workout time. Oh, yeah, the same thing probably. Well, this I think I'm gonna try to like do some like yoga or like light stretching first since like I'm already sore and then walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes, but maybe walk on the bigger treadmill so that I could do an incline and then do another like 10-20 minute workout. Yeah. 10-20 minute workout with your brother? No, like just on the TV in there. Like I look up a YouTube video and tells me what to do. Yeah. Yeah, I can barely get through 10 minutes of that workout. Like I'm I think I need a fucking build my stamina before I can like actually do like a 30 minute to an hour workout with my brother without dying. I was like literally like laying there like it like made me do like a what are they called like fucking these like weird Superman things and I was like, nah, dude, I'm gonna die. Yeah, like I was just like I was doing anything. Okay, like rest time. Don't don't stop moving though. And I was like, I'm dying TV. I'm dying TV man. Oh, guess who's fucking coming out?

I'm not sure which one. Yeah. You know, I don't know if you're taking recommendations. Like, I know that... Well, I actually... Do you have an idea how long you're trying to do, like, an inpatient treatment? Like, do you have a preference? Well, so, I know... I guess they have programs if you stay three to six months. You know, once you get done, they help you with money and a place to live and stuff. So, that's what I was told, anyways. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. And is your partner going to be going with you through that? Not Craig. I have a different boyfriend now. And he's already up there.

You know, he, like, left his phone and I, I mean, I know where he's at now, but, and told him that I had to, like, you know, I called, called, like, um, uh, the jails and, and then I eventually got, like, a hold of his mom and so it's, like, not, not an emergency or anything, but uh, I was, like, um, I was wondering if anybody had been able to meet with him because, I don't know, I don't want him to, like, get kind of, like, lost in the system and, and kind of, I don't know, because he needs quite a lot of babysitting. Yeah. I don't know. So what does that have to do with him coming out? Oh, I wanted to, not, not tomorrow, but I'm gonna apply, yeah, he's interested in applying, like I told him about getting the housing out here. Yeah. Well, that'd be good for him, I guess. Yeah. Homie needs to be medicated, though. Yeah, and that's another thing that we talked about, and he's, like, um, you know, our, is, like, um, you know, his situation uh, unique, like, to the, like, they would want to do, like, an inpatient, sort of, like, whatever you call it, I don't, I think they call it an arts, fucking arts center, I don't know. What? For what? So, like, an arts center, I think is what he called it, and it's, like, basically, like, uh, um, I guess, like, a 24, or 70, 48, or 72-hour hold, uh, where they hold you, and it's kind of like a detox facility, but it's, um, to address, like, mental health, and... Oh, okay. Okay. I don't know, but, uh, yeah, I was just kind of back and forth with my supervisor, um, about whether or not he was going to come out here, and if it's, like, worth putting on board, obviously. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I fucking, I clocked it back out, clocked it back out, and I walked back out to the front, and I wasn't out there for more than a couple minutes, and that guy fucking came and talked to me again, and then he called me, and I was like, oh, one second, sorry. And now he's gone again. What does he look like? Um... Oh, no, just kidding. He's still here. I'm video calling him.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Hello. Hey. Hey. What's up? Nothing. Just at work waiting for you. Oh, yeah. And when was I supposed to get there? Whenever you get here is fine. Like, I've been stalking you. Like, don't make any stops. But it seems like you're going to be getting here on time. I can clock out as early as 420. I'm listening. I've been paying attention this morning. I'm listening. I've been paying attention this morning. I thought you were in Buffalo. No, I'm in Monticello. Yeah. Why? I don't know. When I was leaving St. Cloud, like, I was kind of keeping track of like, where my directions were taking me and vaguely. And then I'm like, man, this is not going to be good if I'm like, going that going the same or going to Buffalo or whatever. Right. No, yeah, I've been I've been watching your timing and stuff. And it says you're going to get here, like, maybe a couple minutes after 420. But that's fine. Let me see. Where are you right now? Yeah, because when I just looked, you're in Clear Lake. Yeah, now you're in Becker. And it says 19 minutes. So yeah, you're going to get here five minutes after I can clock out. If it had been that I got off at four, I guess you're kind of late. But because I didn't get here till 940 or 950, I clocked in. I have to be here for six and a half hours. I got you. Yeah. My mom just sent me a picture of the boys. They're at home eating McDonald's. That's good. Yeah, she got them little happy meals. You're in Monticello? Yes, I'm in Monticello. Oh, then this is going to be my fucking turn then. You don't have to turn yet. Or maybe you do. I don't know. How far? Where are you? It's not this turn. It's like the next fucking one. You know what crossed my mind? What? I could fucking, you know, I should check on fucking Melissa. Yeah. I mean, not like physically, like right now or anything. But I try to get a hold of her, get her on the phone. And if she is still right where I left her. Right where you left her? I mean. If she's living in the same place I remember is a better phrase of words. Right where I left her. Yeah, you turn on the holiday store on 165. Right. Where are you? Have you ever done that? Has that ever happened to you? Where you like, you kind of take a mental note of like, where, where, what the last time you've seen, like one of your long term friends and long time friends. And then you just so happen to like, not, you know, life comes, life comes up. I don't know. Actually. So I get what I'm trying to say is I, I kind of had an experience like that. There's this girl that I, we all used to hang out with named Angela Brand. And her place was like the party spot for like a while, a long while, actually. And in her mind, in her mind, it is still the party spot. Yeah. But. Yeah, I remember the last time I like hung out over there. Um, I can't remember the last time before, but it was basically, they were all doing the same thing, drinking, sitting on a couch, watching TV. And when I came back, like years later, like they all looked exactly the same on the older. Yeah. Kind of like King of the Hill. Yeah. Like the reprise of King of the Hill. Like everyone who's still outside drinking beers, but they just look old. Right. Like right. Where are you? Yeah. That's funny. Dude, it's fucking what? Janelle was trying to fucking hustle me a little bit today. Why? I don't know. Huh? The chick that you took to court? Yes. Okay. Why? Um, um, why? Well, we got, I don't know, because I think she, I think it's only natural to some degree that, uh, when you're kind of like just in a kind of a overall kind of harsh environment and somebody is like, I don't know. Bringing you places, being nice, fucking, uh, you know, letting her, letting him hit your vape. And yeah, she's like, at some point she started to get a little weird. It was a little weird. Why? Did she say she was going to like S or D for some money or something? What if I were to say yes? I would say, call the cops. You got harassed. No, it's not. But like, I don't know. We were talking about something, um, I like legitimately recover related and, um, then all of a sudden that like kind of jumps from like, um, you know, like, I don't know. Um, um, yeah, it jumps from my verse. I'm sorry. Just yawned. No yawning. Oh no, it's okay. Now that I'm thinking about her, I'm just going to lay down. I'm just going to close my eyes for a little bit. You can do that when I drive home. Make it here alive. All right. I'm back. What? What? I'm in the middle of the story. Oh yeah, sorry. I just got really tired. Where was I saying? That you guys were talking? Oh yeah, yeah. So we were talking about recovery stuff and then it like kind of shifts to like, like healthy relationships. And I don't know. I really, so here's the deal. I can't, I really can't say that she did or said anything, anything really. I really can't say that she did because she didn't technically say or do anything. But I, she was like, um, I think I had mentioned something about fucking are getting a new vapor or having to get a new vape soon. And cause hers died and she was basically kind of like very extremely subtly like trying to hustle me for a fucking, uh, yeah. Hustle me for fucking beginner cigarettes. But then I was like, uh, you know, I can actually lose my job by doing that. I can't, I shouldn't do that. Right. And I don't know. It was like for a minute when I had said like, you know, kind of put my foot down and it was just kind of a quiet car ride. I also let her drive the vehicle too, by the way. Why would you do that? Because she's an old woman and she was sweet and I just didn't want to fucking drive. Oh, okay. I guess that's fine. How old is she? 47. She's like 10 years older than you, Brandon. She does. It looks like she's fucking 50, 55, but I, of course say the opposite of that statement whenever it comes up. Right. You're like, you don't look a day over 24. You look younger than my baby mom and she's 12. All right, I cleaned up a little bit. Now it looks nice and clean in here. You have my fucking chapstick? No, I don't have your chapstick. I have chapstick, but I don't have your chapstick. All right, whatever. All right, I should be there in a little while. I don't know. As long as I don't get distracted. All right. Yeah, it says you should be here in like 10 minutes. 10 minutes? Where the fuck are you again? I thought you said you were in Monticello. Let me see if you've been driving fast. Directions, eight minutes. You should be here in eight minutes. Where in Monticello are you? At the Walmart. What do you mean? Oh, that's like in fucking Buffalo, bro. No, it's not. It seems like Buffalo. You have the directions on, correct? Yeah. Where you're going? Okay. Yeah, but they lie. They lie sometimes. All right. Oh, God. All right, well, I'm going to pack up and then let me know when you're outside. Okay. Yeah, maybe I'll do that. All right.",

Okay, so, um, I was gonna say, uh, you, you, you called, and then, um, yeah, no, actually, I'm just kind of pulling myself together. I seen you called, what's going on? Um, I was, uh, um, I wanted to ask you what you thought about, um, I have a, um, he asked me to give him some, he's going to go get, uh, can you talk? Can you talk to me, or will you be around other people? Okay. He asked me to give him some money, um, so that he can go down and pick up for the people, you know, he's got to drive like six hours or something. And I just didn't know, like, his character, what kind of person is he, he is like, or his reputation. I haven't asked anyone. Because I don't want anyone to know who I'm going to get it from. Okay. He's being quiet. Okay. So it sounds like, yeah, you're right. You're right. I'm surprised you didn't freak out, actually, because that's weird. Yeah. Let me, um, that to my ears. I'm surprised you are very calm about that. Yeah, I am. And I, I just don't know. You know what I mean? It's too good to be true. It is probably very true. Actually, everything is probably, but some, I feel like we should kind of forces. It's kind of forces like a conversation with me, you and Hefi right now, just to kind of confirm. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I have anxiety about it, but I just, I don't, I gave him a thousand bucks and I want to trust him and I don't want, and I want to believe him. Yeah. It is what it is. Like it's already happened. So no matter what, it's, you know, it's going down. I just wanted, I was trying to get ahold of you before I did it. So I could, you know, ask you what you think I should do, do it or not. Yeah. But what kind of person deals with that? So it was just, so I just want to kind of ask you a few clarifying questions, but it was Tom that you talked to. Was he with anybody else? No. Okay. Neither times that I met the first time that I met him. Yeah, I suppose. That's not a bad thing or anything. I just, I'm going to try. And if I hear something similar to him, then. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of a little idea. Yeah. See if he's going down there. Yeah. I mean, it's just, I mean, not that like, I don't trust Tom. It's just like our due diligence just to kind of make sure that everything's Okay. Good. Help us develop a better understanding of how long. $1,000 isn't going to be in your pocket. Yeah. Yeah. Literally. You know, yeah. That's what I was saying. Like a thousand bucks. Like, I don't know. You know, this game is so dirty. It's just like. I don't even like, you know, trust anybody, but also it's just like, if, if it really is real and all that, like, I don't want to miss out on an opportunity that could really. Set me up. Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Thank you for having the confidence on that. I feel like you probably would have picked up on it. But I just wanted to agree with you. Like, yes, that is very odd. Thank you for. Trust. Just to safeguard. I'm just going to kind of do it. Like I said, we'll message him. I'm probably. Jump in the shower and maybe start. Moving things, moving around. I don't know. I think. Oh, All right. I'll talk to you soon. Bye.",

Just left Becky's, but... I'm, uh... Just going to take care of something, dude. I put it on hold because of the ice storm and some other shit. Hey, but... She's a cool-ass chick, dude. How do I not know her? Um... You said she's known you her whole life, or what? Yeah, pretty much. Yeah, like, I looked out after her when she was in prison and everything, and... Yeah, that sucks, dude. That Apanur dude, that PH dude's a piece of shit. I didn't know him personally before, but I know that he just got raided again. Oh, yeah. I wonder who he's... Oh, yeah, oh. They found all the guns and drugs at his girlfriend's house, and he was, uh... And, uh... He went to jail, but she didn't, but she's, like... She's scared that he was going to let her take the rap for it, I guess. Like, talking to this chick, like... That totally seems like something he would fucking do, dude. Mm-hmm. Right, yeah, I know him. I don't know. Stuff that she had to go and do all the time just because a dude was fucking harassing her on Facebook and doing all that weird shit. That Yogi dude's a piece of shit, too. Yeah. Well, yeah, I don't know. I was just, uh... You said, uh... Yeah, she was telling me about, um... You stopped by a second ago, but, um... And, fucking, I was trying to get a... Me and Ivan were trying to kind of talk yesterday to get some understanding or shit, but our communication has sucked lately. So, do you have, like, uh... Oh. Do I what? Hold on, you got cut off because somebody was beeping in, dude. So I couldn't hear what you said. Um... You actually said that you picked up a thousand bucks? Yeah, yeah. She gave me a thousand. Um, I'm gonna... Hey, dude. I promise you that nothing's gonna... Like, she'll be more than happy, dude. I'm not gonna do that to her or you since you vouched for me, you know. I understand how it is, dude. But you have nothing to worry about, dude. You know I'm not like that. No, no, I know. And I told her, I just reassured her. I was like, well, we all just determined we all trust each other. I just wanted to follow up what the plan was. So we know what to expect. I told her... Yeah, I told her exactly, like, what happens. Sometimes it will go this way. Sometimes it goes that way. Depends on what time I get down there. Because, you know, as well as I do, they don't work late. So that part sucks. But it's also safe. How far down do you gotta drive? Um... Maybe an hour or so past Diamond Joe's. Diamond what? It's not, like, Kansas or anything, is it? Here. Fucking leash just keeps beeping in, dude. Did you hear what I said, though? No, I didn't hear. Maybe like an hour past Diamond Joe's. I don't know what that is. Maybe an hour and a half. Is that like a... Is the casino just over the border? I don't know. Yeah, it's got like a big fucking oil can or something on a post. Yeah, yeah. It's kind of like that big barn-looking thing or something. Extravagant. Dude, is that the bar? Is that the casino that's got the swim-up bar? It's like a... No, it doesn't even have a fucking... Wait, does it? I guess I've never been to the hotel side of the swimming pool, but... Wait, I think maybe it does. Because somebody was telling me about that shit. Yeah, I can't remember. I mean, this is... Yeah. It's not too bad, dude. But... I mean, it's a fucking... The whole fucking area smells weird because it's all farmland and fucking... I don't know. As soon as it gets a little bit warm out there, fucking everything starts stinking like fertilizer, dude. So when were you thinking about actually taking off? Because I'm going to be there shortly. You know what? When were you thinking about taking off? Because I'm going to be there shortly. Yeah. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah. Someone just keeps beeping in. I'll call you right back. It's fine.

No. Yeah, he was when I told him about the. This idea or whatever, not as whatever and. Yeah, he said. He's not going to go out there tonight. OK. Yeah, yeah, and he said it tomorrow. He's going to go out there and. What else? Uh. I was in the car all day long. Yeah, I was work. It was fine. Yeah. I wonder if you could ask happy if he could. Float some out. Maybe he wouldn't be able to do that, but. I wonder if eventually we'll just see how this first one runs, you know, but I know eventually that's like without a doubt. Yeah. Yeah, 100%. And I feel like. And I did talk to Tom. And. It wasn't like a complete conversation because like you were both going out of service. Yeah, maybe I can eventually go and meet his dude. Eventually. Tom. Oh, have they? Yeah, well, you can. But he is people. Right? Yeah. It's like Tom and the people in between them are irritating little Spanish. I don't speak English. Well, yeah, that's it. I want to meet those people because I've said the same thing. Sounds like. Huh? Yeah, I've said the same thing a bunch of times and it sounds like they fucking do their own little thing and they piss off. Okay. And. Yeah, that is kind of what it seems like. Is that what you were going to say? Well. Well, they don't. It's like. Because I can feel like he's not going to want to. Get me stuff because it's he's not making anything off of me. You know what I mean? Okay, but it's not you that like he's making money off of like he makes money off of his customers. Like you're like think of it as like you're the same rank as him. I don't know if you want to. Yeah, like that. And that's and and then I did want to like get on like some sort of video call or something because like that's about as like great like close or whatever the fuck you want to say just to be like, hey. Face name face, whatever. And then it kind of goes just to text. The Google Translate or whatever, but. But yeah, that's what I wanted to do. Yeah. And I'm trying to like nail down a time and he said that basically he's got to go up just a little bit past the casino. I don't even know why. I mean, I just like I didn't really have a chance to explain to him that and like, yeah, we trust you and all that. But it's like these sort of practices aren't really like that secure. It's like especially with just getting to know each other. I mean to think that it's something where to go wrong. I mean, that's a totally shatters trust and for future ship. I don't know why somebody would run. Yeah. Right. So I mean, that's what kind of what I was like. Yeah, like I believe him, you know, he's gonna I believe it's gonna be fine. But I just asked him if I could get more than you know, like a couple. And he's like, well. He's like, I don't mind helping you out. But like if it's for other people or anyone else or something. I was like, what the heck? Yeah, for you. Yeah, like he I think he's basically he does. I think he was a little like because the amount of profit that he makes off of the large amounts is like not so much because now he has to share that with you. Yeah. So I mean, it's kind of like I said, not like everybody else gets that price. It's just you. Right. Well, that's what I'm saying. Like, I don't know. You know what I mean? Like I don't because I need that. I mean, I could get rid of five tonight and I think he's probably not picking up that much and he's definitely not probably wanting to drive and do felonies. Because he even kind of mentioned that felonies aren't for free. You know. So confused by what is I really would like you to hear his game plan, but it makes me so irritated. I like over ownership. What? I really want to hear what his game plan is. Why he needed $1,000 to not go someplace is that I'm going to just. I don't know. You're very patient. I don't know if so, he told you that he's going, he's not going, I don't understand. Well, it's just another line with them. Yeah, can we put him on? I should put him on a three-way call or something. Well, yeah, but I want to make sure that you're like. Yeah. Yeah. I know I started to come out that direction. I'm not sure I'd rather do it tomorrow when I'm tired. And you got to work tomorrow. Yeah, it'll work clearly. Yeah. Like, yeah, I'm used to have all day. Um, yeah, it's a fair assessment. Yeah. I mean, there was like a little bit of relaxing in there. Yeah. Tomorrow can be very busy or what? Well, yeah, so that's what, that's kind of where I'm at is like, how can I eventually pick up that amount to on my own where he doesn't feel like, like, he's making nothing, you know? He's not going to make it. He's not ever going to make money off of you. Right. So, there's going to be no incentive for him to go and get it. So, I'm going to eventually going to have to probably get it myself. That's right. I don't know if it's like, I don't know that. What I'm about to say is real or, but it kind of makes sense. But I think like the cost of it down the road. Is like, really, like, it starts out small, but then as people, like, handle it, I think that's how it gets like, up to the amount that it is now. I don't know. I don't know if it's like that. It wouldn't make sense. Like, it is. Yeah. So, I mean. Like, the price in the candy shop is going to stay the same, no matter who picks it up. It's just however many are moving at that time. I guess I'm not really sure. Right. Right. Right. All right. I really wanted to be the guy to go down to Kentucky. Well, yeah, he was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. Yeah, he was. Yeah, he was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. He was. I'm going to ask him, what is it going to take, how much do I have to give him in order for him to give me like five tonight? If you just tell him, tell him that you need that amount, then I, yeah, it should be like a cooperative thing. Shouldn't have to like dance or sing for it. I know, but then he might avoid me and give me the cold shoulder again. In fact, if it's five or more, can you look at discount? Yeah. Right. So that's maybe that's how I was thinking of you called half a and asked him to give homeboy a little bit more, but. I think he only had enough money for what he deals with. I don't know. Yeah. Hey. Five. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I love the word to narrow. What's up? Are you talking to me? Yes, yes, yes. Yeah, I've set one up before. I mean, yeah, I can. I don't know. I'm struggling with mine. But if you set up yours, it's like the preferred method of texting. And I have been failing to set it up. So I keep on texting him on Facebook. Yeah. Copy paste this text to you. So you can see what I sent him. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, my God. So many people messaging me right now. Well, he'd give that to him without the money. I think it works like that. Yeah, I have one of the big packages, but I do come up here. I get paid off in time. Yeah. No, you don't get to pay that one. But you got to remember, I guess. I guess there is a level of distress because of the last time. I have introduced some people to this. They could take them home. My buddy, Luke, took like eight pounds of them and did it again. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. My buddy, Luke, took like eight pounds of them and did it again. Right after that. Let's go. All right, so now new contact. What's his name? Okay. Message yourself. Huh? What you're saying is what I was saying to myself. What are you talking about? The WhatsApp? Yeah. So it starts out with like favorites, right? Yeah. It doesn't say. It says new group, new contact, new community, new broadcast. I don't know. I don't know. What's up. Well, then I try to call. Let me text you. Yeah. Experiment with us. I don't really know. What's your number? My phone number. You don't know your phone number. I do. I know my device phone number, but I feel it. I thought so too. That's right. Give me your phone number so I can message you and you can see if I have a new number or not. Okay. It's three, two, zero. Seven, seven, five. Nine, one, three, zero. Three, two, zero. Seven, six, three. Why does that work? Seven, six, three. Three. Two zero. Seven, seven, five, nine. So you said. There's no seven, six, three. So three, two, zero. Seven, seven, five, nine, one, three, zero. Yeah. My phone number is not on WhatsApp. Invite to WhatsApp. I thought you could contact anyone on it. I don't know. I don't understand what you're trying. That's what I was saying. I'm trying to figure this out. I feel like I got it working before and it was working fine. But now it's like I redownloaded it and I don't really know how to get it working right again. Oh, that came through. But it still says your name. Oh, okay. That's because I put my name on there. Okay. Messaging. Only people in this chat can read. All right. But I did message through the. Yeah. Not in our regular thread. Yeah. No, no. I didn't get. Okay. Now you're typing. Okay. No. Okay.

    "transcript": "Hi. Hi. I'm sitting here texting like a fucking schoolgirl twirling my hair. How's it going? I'm like. Cute. I like that. Yeah. I like that. I know. I'm like trying to text and then I was on the other line with Thomas and then he messaged Thomas while we're messaging here now and asked him if he knew me. And Thomas said he was cool with giving me five. He doesn't mind, but also he doesn't, you know what I mean? It's like, he's like, well, your price or what? What price? You know? So I don't want him to lose out on any, but also I don't, I'm not the one with the money right away. Honestly. I have the money. I just like getting it. I have it right away as soon as I, but I have to have the stuff. Yeah. I don't know what to say to him either. I don't know what to say to him either. I feel like a little school girl. Right. Right. I don't know what I'm thinking. I'm just kind of. Yeah. But he did tell the other guy that you don't like text good enough or text back fast enough. So you got to be hard on top of that. What's up has been some questions questions. Also, we're working so hard. I'm sorry. Don't don't let me talking out loud throw you off. You can talk alone. I don't even care right now about the cheaper price, honestly, because it's really cheap. I don't even care right now about the cheaper price, honestly, because it's really cheap. So, like, I mean, like, I was going to ask him about like, okay, well, we just gave Tom like $1,000 and he says he's not going to go get go around. Don't worry. Okay. Yeah, you don't are just just like his time. Yeah, he's he's getting it. He's got to be getting it tonight. We just trust them. It just sounds like he's just like, I don't know like it to me it sounded like he was like waiting for it or going to get it earlier and then he fucking. And then he is like oh yeah I'm at home or whatever but I guess that's what he does is he goes and drops off the money and then, and then a couple hours come and tell him where to go to pick it up. But this dude might want to deal with me more maybe. Yeah, I think that could only but dealing with being that person I'm into like you're driving you're doing. I mean Tom does dangerous. You guys do dangerous dangerous as fuck to drive like that. Yeah, sounds super dangerous. But I mean if I got it if I had a nicer car. I'm hoping to get it soon. I can probably even get this out you because I told I told that to Thomas like well, you know, I want to get it. And Tom told me I'll be able to do that right away probably. I do, I would super suggest, so I do know that to answer your question, as far as like imploding you a certain amount. I know that he is comfortable doing that right because it's just a convenience but like the amount of risk like he doesn't like he's not going to do anything about it like if we get if we gets lost and it's like something about it because I'm his on his side. I have to try to figure out how to get back and and I'm like, yeah, so I mean if you have it over well, this first five would be. I don't know. Yeah, this is the first time that like they get the money. Yeah, or what about if you want to tell them how much money you got because it's probably going to be this next question is like how much you got right now. Well, I gave Tom 1000 and I got probably another 700 cash on me right now just on me and probably I could probably come up with another 1000 right now but this girl wants to and she's got the cash on her. So I'll have and I'm charging her 18 well probably do 19 because I told her I didn't really get the price yet but I told her it was going to be cheaper than what I was charging her which was 21. So I'll have for five grand rate like right away instantly and then this other guy wants three and he's got the cash on hand too and I'm charging him the same. So I'd have the money right away. Are you there. Are you there. I have like six grand right away so that's well over. No, I don't like I have six grand plus another. What two, four, six, 12, I'd have like 10 grand right away. Right, because that's if you want to, and then that's like damn near 4000. One, two, three, four, five, six, 615 either way I'd have, I just texted my buddy to see because he said he had the cash on him. Okay, yeah, the girl still down. You're breaking up again I can't hear. I'm about to text this message. Yeah, by the time, as soon as time gets back, it'll be, we'll be here. Yeah, by the time, as soon as time gets back, it'll be, we'll be here. But you heard so you heard what I just said right, I don't need to send this to you before I send it to him. Yeah. We gave Tom 1000 so he can go grab it. He has almost 1k left right now, and about 4k when he gets back. Yep. Plus, another four if I can get more. At the least, so, or you could just say it just skip all that and just be like, just say I got like. Yeah, just say I got like five, five more grand. What's up buddy. What's up my friend. It might be like easier to explain to him how many you're like look at this week for sure and then like. Yeah, I was just trying to keep it as simple as. But Tom said he didn't mind giving me giving me five, like he finally said it I think after I've been on the phone, because I told him I was in a group chat with you guys. And then, which I'm glad I did tell him that because then Ivan messaged him and asked him if he knew me. So then at least, at least Tom's in the loop and doesn't feel like we're trying to go behind his back. Even though it's not going behind his back on your end and just for me, kind of probably would felt like that. No, I mean, I mean, I don't know if I can't without fully thinking about it, it sounds like being overly courteous, but I'm not. Overly courteous. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. Tom is awesome. I mean, I, I haven't like worked with him like for a super long time or anything, but I did spend like the first, I don't know, year and a half that I know knew him, like, I don't know, we actually were some, I already told you all that, but it doesn't really apply right now, but it is funny. I just think it's funny. I think it was, oh, I've almost killed this guy. I didn't even really know him. But yeah, he's great because he does, you know, he does the sketchy shit. He doesn't mind doing it. And he's trustworthy. I guess I'm not going to assume that he's going to be perfect 100% of the time because I don't fucking, nobody's fucking perfect. I just know that he, yeah, I think he's actually been to Mexico. I think Tom has gone down and seen like where he lives on the land. I don't know. He's going to this year. I think he said, that's what I said. I was like, man, if I come out there, like you put me up and he's like, yeah, Tom, Tom said, really funny. I was like, so does, cause I had to have this conversation with him with Tom. I was like, and he's like the only person I really have it with. I was like, dude. So I kind of like, I don't know. I kind of stared with him, like my thought, my full thoughts. I was like, so you think like I told him about how, like, you know, when I first met, I was like, you know, he's like, he seemed like super fucking polite, you know, he was like, you know, soft spoken. And, and, you know, I didn't get like any sort of like negative vibe from like, not non threatening. And if anything, he seemed like, he seemed like he may have been like apprehensive of me, like, because of like, I don't know. I guess I was my trap house at the time. But I, so I was like, I was asking him, Tom, I just read, I mean, do you think he's like cartel? And he's like, I can't really fully remember. I'm pretty sure he's like, he's like, yeah, or maybe I can't maybe you'll have to ask him what his response was. But he said, like, I was like, is he got like a mansion or something? He's like, yeah, it's like a mansion, but it's got dirt floors. I can laugh at that. Yeah. I guess Mexico for that. Yeah, he has some. Yeah, I don't know. I've had to do some kind of odd transactions. And the beginning was, I haven't he'd having me go to like, these Mexican grocery stores, you know, that they have random, like, you know, like, you know, like, like, I don't know. You know, that they have randomly throughout the metro area, and I'd have to go in there. And there's like, all these moms fucking like, buying weird shit. And I have to like, put a money order in for however much money, send it directly to him. Yeah, his workers that his workers are fucking I don't trust his workers like they're, he trusts them enough that he wouldn't like ever let me talk him into fucking replacing them, which I fucking really would like to. But yeah, he just doesn't sound he doesn't sound into that idea. And I think it's, I don't know, maybe it's because he's, they're part of the fucking transporting process. They've been dumping fences and fucking bobbing and weaving. Maybe that's why I have no idea. Yeah. Oh, yeah.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hello? Huh? Can you hear me? Barely, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, I was wondering if I was the same girl that, uh, that Woodson's name was going to get rid of it, too, who lives way up north and pays a lot. Oh. Oh, yeah. What about... But I thought you guys had already talked about that price. Dan? You're talking about Dan, right? Huh? You're talking about Dan, right? No. No, I'm talking about Ivan, though, because Ivan just said, just said, uh, $2,500 apiece. Apiece? A pound. Like, in a private message he sent that to you? No, don't you read it? Did you read it? It says, what his message says is, it says, we, he said, well, I give Tom the piece for $2,500, but how much are you willing to pay for all five with cash in hand? Holy shit. Hold on. Hold on. I'm gonna fucking stop. I'll fucking stop his texting right now. Oh, you're gonna call him? No, no, like, what the fuck? How do you spell whoa? Well, yeah, well, no, um, so, um, what's his name? What Tom was saying, like, don't, like, whatever, once you say a price and you're locked in, he said, uh, he said that, uh, uh, ask, ask questions. Don't like keep giving them whatever, get them back with more. That would never. Which I didn't tell him. I didn't tell him. I didn't, I didn't tell him what we were saying, but I didn't tell him any of that. But I just said, I said, what's the P I asked him what, what is the piece? And he said, for one, for a pound. Yeah. No. I would ask him to be like, I thought we already discussed the price. Yeah. Yeah. I don't, maybe he's like, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna try to stop. Yeah. Yeah. Just be like, I thought, I thought we already discussed the price or we already have a price. Well, I'm going to be really up front and be like, dude, I, for fucking anything more than what I've already. Yeah. Like I wouldn't, I wouldn't even fucking tell you to come. I wouldn't even start this conversation if it was a fucking. Yeah. Like I can do 2,500. I pay you fucking. Less than that. Yeah. I don't fucking care what the global fucking economy is going on in fucking Bangladesh. Fuck that. God damn it. I can't get this fucking copy and paste it to work. It has a tram. It has a translate option on there. So you can just talk normally and he can press translate. What is the Augusta? I don't know. You don't have to say all that. You can. You can translate for you. So. What do you just press the fucking microphone button? I think. I don't know. I've been doing like pushing the buttons on my keyboard. Yes. It's so if you hold on, hold down the button on the message, it says translate. I don't. So you say how. Like we say, how much were you thinking? Or I thought we already had a price discussed. I thought we discussed the price already. I thought. Yeah. And then I think you can hold it down and I'll translate it for you. Yes. So if you do select all and then that arrow button, you can put translate. And the Spanish replaced with translations. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. It didn't work that time. But it seems like if I just use the not Facebook features. I got like one of those translate things on my on my keyboard. It's on my on my keyboard. I just use. I think I don't know if he knows how to use it, but that's how I translated his messages. It was pressed, held it down. I'm. What do I say? So over five months, like with this counter over two or three, I can't remember. I think it was like three or four or something. You said five. Yeah. You said if it's over five, then it's a discount. Yeah. Yeah. All right. All right. So. You know how much I sold you pieces for? Yeah. Yeah. OK. So, all right. I just read. So I know you already talked about the cost. And you know how much I sold you the pieces for? And I said, gosh, I can't read my own shit when it's back in Spanish. So. Like I said, if you hold it down, I can hold it down. I'm going to translate and I'll translate it. I don't buy from fucking time. I buy from you, fucking dumbass. I don't know. Yeah, I don't give a fuck about any of that. Okay. Yeah. Hold on. Are you actually still trying to type something? I see the bubbles for your super on coming up. Oh, yeah. Your phone's breaking up a little bit. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. Now. Okay. Okay. Okay. I want to say something like I. I wouldn't be able to make any money off of that. And I'd be able to bring you a lot of business. Yeah. I mean, I feel like he I don't really know. I mean, I will get there. I will get to that point. Right. I think right now, anger is the right answer. Almost almost a little. No, it's not for the right answer. Anger is not the right. So I'm about to send this. I've never bought anything from time works for you. I don't know if I can. Yeah, I'll be up front. I would never. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. He said, you know, you get any more. You get a lot better with questions. I'm trying to play the game here. I make it. Keep it nice. Yeah. Yeah. You'd love your own. Well, I'm sure it does cost a lot. And there is a lot of risk. But I don't know if we make some money. So, uh, where to have a beer. I'll see. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'm in the city. No, no. I just read your. I just read your message. Oh, no. I don't really ask him when it comes to all these numbers, everything that he said that he's going to say. And when he just tells me, like, I've been, I've always had to pay 12. Up until six months ago. Now he's saying 13, which I thought was bullshit, but I get it, whatever, but there's no way I'm going to go from 13 to 25. Like, okay, maybe next year, you know, next season, I'll fucking work with you when you get to control your business. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Yeah. Soda. So weird. So weird. I'll like if our sentences, like I'll put like Minnesota in the, in like the middle, but it ends up on the end of a sentence when you're saying it in Spanish. I never understood how that works. Yeah. You should've, you should've heard my buddy Zach last night. We're about to go jump in this hot tub. And there was like this, I don't know what he was saying some super. It was fucking funny. It was funny, but it was also like really rapey that the way he said it to this person. Yeah. I just want to be like, I got five. Sold tonight. And that's not even me trying. That's just people coming to me. It's my Facebook picture on there. When I. Is your Facebook. Yeah. You can see. What are you here? What are you asking? I was just wondering if I have a picture on mine. Yeah. Yeah. Like it looks like a profile picture. Okay. Okay. I would never pay that. Yeah, that's fucking absolutely ridiculous. Yeah. And he said that price was for you, Brandon. Yeah. And that's one of the messages. Is that, yeah. And that's what I was trying to do. To display was that's like. I'm not giving. Yeah, that is my price. So like, that's why I'm giving her. Like you, you know, Think of her. That's my price. That's my price. And she's part of me. I'm just kidding. That's that's helping me out too. And be like, I told her a certain price or something. I don't know. I will say that. Or if I can just at least get these first five for that. Okay. Do any more business. Okay. What's up, bro. You want to change it to a different one? Which one is one. Tell me. You want to pick one? That's so weird. Okay. Okay. I'll take that same price. Same place because then I support. Work together. I should just say work together. Pretty much. I don't know. I don't really know how you want to work. Okay. Oh, I wanted to convey. So this is what the whole message said. No, she's got five sold tonight. And that's not even trying hard, but if we can't do the price, we've been doing that. That price that we've been doing. We'd be willing to do more travel out of state to help you. Okay. Yeah. He was telling me about some shit. Not too long ago. Like there's like a. Like if I'd be willing to like do this. Okay. But he never really told me any of the logistics of it, just that I'd be going to pick it up in Kansas city. I would like her to get that same price because she and I work together. And. Yeah. All right. Okay. Forgot to translate it. Yeah. And he's got an iPhone too. He's all about the iPhone. So. I'm so tired. I was like falling asleep. Driving. I'm away at home. Yeah. I mean, I know that. So. Yeah. No fucking way. If it's that, I wouldn't. I would feel stupid even fucking bring it up to anybody like that. Right. Okay. I don't know. You must have. So take a fucking. Oh, no. That's crazy. Yeah. I was expecting that. Right. Yeah, I'm doing. Damn. 15. Yep. You want to see if you want to, if you want to throw that number in there. By all means. You could. Never probably be a good time to say it because I'm about ready to like. I'm sorry for your losses. Yeah. I wish your business very profitable. If you need any help, let me know in the future. I'm sorry, buddy. Yeah. Yeah. Like that. Like that. Yeah. Okay. Around, I don't know. Okay. To. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. This is what I got. All right. Would you be willing to offer that price one last time? He's got a lot of workers that are ready to go. It's not all about it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. You still work same time tomorrow. Oh, yeah. I'm not sure I might be. I might be hitching a ride off with Zach. Or I might be driving out there. I'm not sure, but. Zach's card. I think. Might be grabbing some. More. Yeah. White girl. I'm not sure. You listen to me. You can call me back if you want. I don't even hear you. Yeah. What. I don't know. I said a few things, but. I can just call you back a little bit or tomorrow or something. Yeah. I mean, a few messages back, like stay in the chat. Yeah. Yeah. I'll look to answer like one or two more times. You, you. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. You don't got plans in the evening, right? Not that I can think of. Yeah. Right. You're not helping this situation. Oh, I didn't even see that. Tell me a message. Yeah. Yeah. You think. Right. Tom says, Brandon, you're not helping this situation. He is saying no to any kind of sale price. Let me do this, bro. Let me do this, bro. I got her and I like Becky and she will be treated. Right. Well. I don't know. Let's say that. Right. He said it again. He says. Brandon, you're not helping this situation. He is saying no to any. Like, let me do this, bro. Like, let me do this, bro. I got her and I like Becky and she will be treated. Right. I assure you. Oh, that's nice. That was not nice. That's scary. I don't trust anybody with my Becky. Oh, you do. You kind of settle down. I need these tonight. I really need them. Yeah. But I don't need them for 2500. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe he'll be able to give them to price. I don't know what he's paying, but. And he's prefer. But maybe keep it at that. Don't go nuts. I'm not a feeder. People. I can only, I can't really understand what you said, but yeah, I mean, I'll take your guys's advice. I could be fucking making things kind of worse. Yeah. You're taking a personal. Yeah. I think it is a business aspect. If I can get it. If I can get it at 15. I'd probably sell it for two. I leave me. Like five. It's more than enough. I only make a couple of hundred off each. I was. It's not even worth it. Well, yeah, no. And there's no way. There's no, I mean, For 2500. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For 2500. Yeah. Okay. We get more. All right, I'll let you go. Yeah. Okay. Whatever. Hey, that's the most they can pay. What do you mean? Oh, I think he meant to what's the most they can pay. That's not, but it's not, that's not the game you want to be in. Honestly, like none of these transactions are become worth it. Unless like you were making like a substantial amount of money. I mean, if you're making only like hundreds of dollars off of like, I don't know, a few trends, I don't know. I don't know. I guess I got a word. My words, right. Correctly, but like it is a huge risk. I mean, but the price that that price is like the right price because of how it works out on the math. But that's, that's crazy. Like the number to go from that to that. That's like, oh, okay. So I guess I got a fucking snow. If I'm going to be make profit, I got to buy 10 pounds at a time now. Yeah. He's this. Dude, he's telling, this is what I'm just saying. He's saying that he's never sold you for that cheap. No, he's saying that's what he's saying. That's what I've been telling saying. Yeah. Yeah. I know. That's what he's telling Tom. Yeah. That's, that's the same price. I've always gotten it for him. In fact, I've even like, he's even got given it to me. He says, if you can. Well, at one point I was like, cause he really wanted to get me put on. I was like, I'm having a hard time coming up with fucking money right away. And he's like, I'll tell you what, if you give me 900. Like you can give me the rest. Like when you like get it up, some of it sold. And I really super appreciate that. Yeah. You better just stop messaging cause you're making it there. He's saying like pretty much saying you're making it worse. Yeah. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not messaging Ivan anymore. Yeah. Why is he. I don't know. Don't take it out. Don't don't. Thanks so much. I feel like maybe. I don't know. What the hell is going on? Because I know that I sent, I said this. I don't know. I don't know. I'm just having a conversation with. With. Prior to all this. Cause naturally I feel like maybe right now he's like. Panicking or something like that. I don't know. Maybe I put him on a weird spot. I don't know. I fucking knew it was weird when Tom said like, he's like, whoa. Like that's I've never paid. Price. I don't know. It's crazy. Communicating a bit. If you're willing to, we can talk about it again later. Shut up. He's keeps on saying that bro. Yeah. Stop. Let him, let him have me. Cause I need it. I need this. I already told them. And if he's going to give it to me for that price. Okay. I don't know what that means. Like, I mean, that's okay. I mean, if he's like, he's got me. Like he's saying, he's saying he's, he's got me taken care of. That's like, he's, he's got this stuff for me. That's what I hope he means. That's all he's saying. Yeah. That's exactly what he means. He doesn't mean anything more than that. He's got me taken care of. He's not saying that. I understand. I understand. I understand. I get it. I get it. I get it. But that doesn't mean I'm not. I mean, has he told you what he's doing yet? Or I mean, cause as far as I know, he's a thousand dollars from where he hasn't given you anything. He already grabbed it and he's already on his way.

I'm like walking through the house and everybody else is still sleeping. I got a letter from your school today. Good. Yeah. Yeah. Um, not really. I got 20 plus parties. 20 plus parties. I can't hear you that well. I can talk normal now. I said 20 plus parties. Like you're like 20 times. That is not sound accurate. I'm not party often. If you, if you were to. I'll send you this text message so you can look at it. Send this document so you can look at it in your text messages. And. How much time do you have to talk. A lot of time. What are you doing awake so early. Yeah. My hair. I might just leave it straight ends, but. I'd rather be up early because I fell asleep really late. Not really. I fell asleep really early last night. Okay. I sent you a document and you're talking about. To look at it or understand it or whatever. While you were laying there. I'll be able to look at it in a second. Okay. All right, so. Already. The school year. Let's see. Yeah. According to this pattern of excessive tardiness. That often leads to unexcused absences. Okay. So. So you don't have any. Anything to. You don't know which classes you'd be tardy to. I don't know. You didn't give me any information. So. If you don't. Have anything to add. I'm just going to talk to the. To the teacher. Attendance lady. I mean, the classes I've had been tardy to like. I'd say the cost I've been tardy to the most is probably my fifth hour. But that's also after lunch, which is on the like. And my fifth hour is on the, the, what the third floor. So, and even then we only have four minutes passing time and. I have to make a stop. Like for each class, because. Like. Okay. So lunch is on the bottom floor. My locker's on the second floor. And then my science classes on the top. Is on the top, the third floor. And we'll only have four minutes of passing time. Okay. Or not a lot. You, you like set to stop at your docker too, or do you carry everything with you? I usually stop at my locker. Okay. What class do you have before? What classes on the, on the bottom floor or whatever. You have to. Oh. You might have to start like. Grabbing your stuff. From. Like. Yeah. You don't have to stop at your locker again. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. So can you remember to do that? Can you like, write it on your hand right now? I'll just do it. No, I mean, I know that you. Or like make a notification on your phone or something. But make, like, I don't want you to like, just rely on yourself to remember to do that. Do yourself some sort of. Like assistance to remember it. So you can start doing it. I just want to work with you. So we can stop. You getting these late parties. I don't know. Yeah. I don't want you on. I don't want you on their radar. Like for all these tardies, it basically sounds like you're going to be. Labeled as a criminal. If you. Continue to be late. Are you listening to me? Yeah. Yeah. So. I know. I remember. It's not hard to remember. All right. So. If you want. Like to get your phone data back and all this other extra show. You have to make sure that shit like this doesn't happen. And. Just remember I'm calling right now. Just to help you out. Y'all may call you later. Make sure that you're okay. Otherwise you're going to. Probably. I just want to say, I love you. Okay. I don't even know why you turned my dad off. I don't know what I did. It was not good behavior. I don't know. You guys are just being rude. And. Yeah. I can turn those back on. Yeah, because we had a discussion about it. I don't think I did anything wrong. I don't recall being disrespectful. Don't you think? Well, I just want you to have a nice day. If you want to talk to me about. Okay. Anything else you want to talk about before I let you go. Are you ready for school? No. Okay. Okay.",

So we do that, and they have to be a Minneapolis resident. Okay. But they, so we help with the ID, driver's license, birth certificates. Okay. And we do that Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9.30 to 11.30. Okay. And I could give you other places that do the same thing, but they are, it's hard to find one that's open today because it's a Friday. Yeah. Yeah, I'm actually, I'm actually like looking for, you know, there's, because I work with clients all the time that are, you know, trying to, you know, kind of make improvements in their life. And this is one of the kind of common milestones. So I also work in Minneapolis and in the St. Cloud office. So if you actually have more information about other locations that do this too, that would be good. So let me, okay. So Catholic Charities, they do it the second Friday of the month, and that's what this is today, but only from 9.00 to 11.00, 9.00 to 10.00. So we, so I'll give you the list of other places that do this on different, I'll just give you the name and the phone number. So Jericho Road Ministries. So is this like something you could like email it to me? So, no. Okay. Okay. Okay. So second Friday, Jericho Ministries, No, no. Second Friday, second Friday of the month is Catholic Charities. Oh, okay. A month. Catholic Charities. Charities. Okay. Ready? 612. 612. 204. 204. 8569. 8569. Okay. Okay. Mount Olive Lutheran Church. Lutheran Church. 612. 612. 827. 827. 5919. 5919.

All those are in Minneapolis. I have one in St. Paul too. Okay. That's called Listening House. 651-227-5911. Okay. And then I also, so is this something that like the paperwork or what does the process look like for each individual? Is it possible that I can like have like a stack of applications for the for them in the case so we don't have to come in or do they have to come in and get it? They have to come in. They have to come in. Okay. All right. And okay. So I should make an appointment to come in on those days. It's a first come first serve. Oh, because you don't have... For us. For us. It's a first come first serve. The other ones I gave you, you may want to call. Okay. Okay. All right. That has been extremely helpful. And you said you take them second Friday of them. I don't know. That was for Catholic Charities, but what did you say about the Basilica? The Basilica is Tuesdays and Thursdays between 9.30 and 11.30. 9.30 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. And that's also first come first serve. So it's like limited. For us, yes. It's not limited. I mean, you know, if you come here between those times, you most likely will be helped. Oh, okay. We don't limit the people that how many people come in. Oh, okay. I get it. So like, it's not like you're limiting the quantity of applications. It's like whoever's there between that amount of time. Exactly. Yeah. If you're there before that amount of time, do you still get the application? Yeah. If you're there earlier, if you're there or they are here earlier, that's fine too. Not too early. I mean, we open at nine, but... Right. Okay. All right. I guess to reframe my question, I was like, if somebody were to show up at like 11.10, would they still be able to get helped? I'm not sure. I'm not sure about that one. Uh-huh. I'm sorry. Go ahead. You want to get here as early as possible. Don't wait to the last minute. Is it pretty busy there on those days? Yeah, exactly. Wow. Okay.

I didn't want to call you if you're with somebody. No, you're right. What's up? Um, well, there's, well, there's a couple things. Um, and the first was, um, you know, I obviously know that I'm not supposed to bill for somebody for more than four hours one day. So if so if I actually do end up spending more time with that person in four hours, then I just like cut it off at four hours or is there like a solution to like that? Um, I would definitely call Miles on that. I cut it off at four hours just because like one time I wouldn't let me clock out. We were at an event and it wouldn't let me clock out and it went to like four or one. So I just adjusted my time to four. Um, but yeah, just definitely talk to Miles about that. Okay, I can do that. And then, um, the next thing, um, I was seeing Colette Berg in the beginning of this week. Um, and, um, I don't know if you had a chance to read my notes. Man, you better quit punching him, dude. All right. Um, um, yeah, right. Yeah. I don't know if you had a chance to read my notes, but, um, uh, but I was able to talk her basically into starting treatment and she should be getting picked up today. I don't, I don't read notes anymore. Oh, you don't? Nope. That's Miles. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Um, and then let's see. Oh yeah. And then there's two more things. Um, I, I remember a while ago we were talking about the list of resources and whatever, kind of compiling them or just sharing them with each other somehow. Um, do you ever like have a document or anything like, what are you, like a way of putting that together? Cause I was either going to send you what I have or ask you to send what you have to me. Um, pretty much. I just still have all of my stuff just in my head or on my phone. Um, I have, I have one list that's hanging in my office for different like silver houses and stuff. Um, but nothing like, like a template. I guess what would be easier? And if, do you think, do you think it'd be like good for you to like, maybe like photocopy that thing that's on your, in your office and then like maybe just text what you have in your head or like, or actually then I'll send you what I know about the silver houses and you can kind of just tell me your name. Or we can sit down sometime next week. Yeah. Yeah. I don't like that solution. Hi, we're closed today. You are? Yep. Yep. Is there something I can like get to drink or snack on? Um, let's see what we can grab. Um, are you still with me? Yeah, I'm here. You work too hard. Um, you can come back here really quick. Um, all right. Um, for like to go. All right. But yeah, that's what I would do. Pablo's other questions are pretty much miles questions or the last thing. Um, I, uh, earlier, earlier this week there was like that confrontation with Anthony and, and, um, whatever. And you discussed with me, um, uh, you know, not sharing, you know, information or saying things like that in front of people. And it was all, and when I'm, I met with Dagan, I very briefly, like earlier this week, and I am trying to get him to do his, uh, his CD assessments. Um, but, uh, he had mentioned, um, uh, you were good friends with his baby mama. He was like, I, I don't know, I guess he said that he doesn't get along with her and he was concerned that you guys would be like sharing information. And no, I won't share any information about Dagan to her. I thought they were friends though. I mean, I, I was kind of what I thought. I mean, me and my, like, you know, my, my recovery mind, like everything, I always think of everything in like a light optimistic sense. So like when I heard that you guys know each other, sorry, I'm listening. Yeah. Well, yeah. When I heard that you knew his girlfriend or baby mama or something like that, I was like, Oh, okay. That means it's a good thing. So, you know, if there are issues like, you know, them coming around this office means, you know, positive energy. Right. No, I won't say anything about Dagan. I won't even, like I said, I don't read your notes or anything like that. I, um, so I wouldn't even know anything. And I, I am, I wouldn't be, uh, working with him. You know what I mean? Yeah. So no worries there. Okay. Okay. Um, all right. Well, are you, how's your day going? Good. Good. But I need to get back to this. So all those other questions, just, um, ask miles. Copy. All right.

    "transcript": "Hello. Hello. Hey. How's it going? Good. How are you doing? I'm doing well. I'm doing okay. Yeah. I'm doing all right. I was my brain is almost feeling like mush because I've been on the front of the computer a little bit too much today and on the phone but and I was trying not to like abuse you with like the amount of text messages I was sending you so but dude I just like I was just copied and pasted your name and number and like my Google thing like picked it up and as soon as it does that it like it like does like a Google search on your name and do to you are you an accomplished author no I'm not no I just texting that yeah no I I I found out randomly like a month ago maybe that that was a even a thing you know that there was some other guy with my insane name which is weird because I growing up I've never like when googling my own name I've never came across that either so but I know what you're talking about yeah dude that's crazy because like it says like like miles niska is like like mental health like Minnesota something professional on self-help book and I was like holy shit this guy's like a super accomplished he's like I didn't I didn't know you were that qualified one day you know I it's funny because when I saw that I was like okay well then now now it's meant to be you know yeah I know that my story is yet to be yet yet to be written and or that like my accomplishments are still yet to come yeah I don't know how or when I will move forward or move on in life but writing to help others sounds like a really good idea you know yeah that is a good thing that would be a good thing here you know I I did so you said I was not expecting you to say that that wasn't you but that's even a little weirder because I have a somewhat of a similar actually a really similar kind of circumstance like I I like I googled my name and there's another Brandon Gillis that like he lives like he lives like on the west coast or he lived on the west coast and he was like an entrepreneur like but his like business was like a tech business an IT business and um yeah it was really interesting I was like what the hell because his stuff would always come up with my stuff and when I was like you know a business owner but he actually unfortunately he died in August of last year of COVID yeah oh yeah I'm not I didn't actually even like meet him but yeah it was kind of crazy it's interesting do you believe in like synchronicity or like anything like that there's like a bigger meaning to life absolutely do I spend way too much time trying to figure stuff out yeah do you believe in like alternate universes and stuff yeah I mean well yeah yeah yeah there's definitely different planes of existence that's like for sure yeah yeah it's crazy I mean even just to think about like how you know there's twins that have been separated at birth but they still have like the exact same handwriting or like you know whatever they can pick up each other's like thoughts telepathically long distance they can you know reunite after 20 or years and still be on the same page like I don't know life is crazy man there's kids that are born with memories of like down to aircraft pilots from world war two that can like tell you about everything that happened before they died or how they died yeah you know um yeah I don't know yeah my next question for you is do you believe in aliens of course of course oh yeah just don't get me going about the aliens bro bro listen I that was how and what I did when I got sober was I researched the topic of aliens and or energy and or like you know like what life is I guess if that makes sense so I feel like I've always been open to that I I've seen anomalous stuff in the sky since a teenager I actually have videos of like orbs outside of my house like like three different three minute minute long uh films on my iphone of this like ball of light that was like going in circles and changing colors and moving all around the sky but like still like staying in a relative area it was really cool bro and I bet that bet that was recently too wasn't it yeah yeah yeah it was like a year ago or so oh my god oh my god I just broke something dude I just saw I just saw an orb for the first time like that night that I was working on that car uh the night I was with Zach yeah that was my first ufo crazy like about a month and a half ago I saw like three of them in like a 10 minute period dude yeah um yeah you got this uh I don't know if I know I try not to talk about it really too much I say that and I say that every time I bring it up but I try I try not to talk about it too much because I really don't want to fucking sound like a crazy person at all like that's not appealing to me but there is uh this documentary that's that uh just came out within the last month called age of disclosure and um it's supposed to be like really good and uh and uh and then like and then within the week or like three weeks of that being uh like released uh Steve Spielberg releases this this preview for this movie that he's coming out with now and uh it's called the movie that movie's called uh day of disclosure yeah have you seen that preview yet no I I've heard of it but I mean I I pretty much am aware that any and every sci-fi movie over the last 50 years has been disclosure in the form of soft disclosure um both like approved by actual government channels as well as like you know people that are just in the know I know that they hold disclosure over our heads like a dangling carrot um while secretly still like lying to our face and subverting money and their intentions um I know that NASA is fake I know that the whole world is bigger than what they say it is there's a big old ice wall yeah you know yeah outer space may actually have a firm a minute even though I'm not religious I do like I've seen a lot of different crazy things about that I also believe that like the world is both us here and it's flat and it's one of those things that you know it's what whatever your paradigm is right so it's like what you're only bound by the constraints in your head and and your perception you know like how they've done that slit experiment where it it'll go through either the right or the left slit depending on who's looking at it have you ever heard of that yeah yeah I think that I didn't I didn't hear the last part thing that you said you like it as a matter and really loud you're kind of breaking up um yeah I said I couldn't I couldn't really hear the last like few words you said because my kid was saying that like yeah that everything is like what you believe it to be true and that kind of goes back to like how we create our own world and I was referencing this experiment is called the split experiment or maybe it's called the experiment or maybe it's called the double slit experiment and it basically that is that the results of the science physical experiment change on whether or not somebody is watching it or not that's so that's kind of hard for me to wrap my mind around yeah I mean I would just I would probably just do it and then you'll find out way more information than I could tell you but I mean I also know that like the words that we say and the thoughts that we have carry energy and that those are the you know things like whatever we tell we whatever we tell ourself is true is true you know and the world will align to that but we have to stay focused you know so like positive self-talk is huge um and that's one thing that like I try to like point out to my clients and then you know like encourage change on right because like there's themes that are running in our head and we always are going to choose like you know to believe whatever we tell ourselves so why not tell ourselves positive things you know and sometimes that takes like challenging years of learned behavior and um you know experiences that reinforce negativity but you know like the messages that were told at home you know like you're not good enough you're not smart enough or maybe you are good enough and maybe you are smart enough you know um but generally when we have clients they have issues that are you know deep-seated all the way back to our childhood you know yeah yeah yeah no that's absolutely right yeah yeah I got your yeah I got your text I got your text about the um the admin hours and yes yeah if you're if you're over going to be over for the four hours and yeah please submit that okay okay I'll do that okay I will I will um yeah I think I'll oh yeah and all right then I also like um there's a this thing maybe this is more of an azac thing but I was gonna talk to him sometime today but I I like I don't know I was too busy on the computer and kind of focused but uh there's there's like this uh document that I kind of put together about the driver's licenses and I don't know just some resources and and we're kind of kind of went into like um I don't know I told Heidi about it too and kind of piggybacks on a conversation we started a month ago about everybody consolidating our resources and having them available um but I don't know I I sent it I'm supposed to get her information later but I just sent you over what I have already and okay because you wanted to like have it uploaded in the app and again maybe that's an azac thing or a whole thing but it is kind of cool yeah okay well um I would definitely recommend talking to him about that in particular um some of that admin stuff I'm not exactly sure about how to even do or whatever if that makes sense but um in general I think that um he would probably want to you know talk to you or hear from you or see how you're doing um and has definitely like asked me regularly about you know updates you and the progress you're making and you know effort or initiative that you've been putting in and um all that so damn so yeah he's been damn all right all right I'll call him right now actually I mean it well I mean to be fair it's been like that about everybody I mean because right now who does not in the office so I have to update him um and or he's like the one that is being hands-on with um pretty much everything right now so yeah yeah okay so last question I swear okay if um so when uh one of our clients go does a assessment at Kaishen and obviously there's that ROI that between us and that organization they send us over that uh CD assessment and it would make sense that that CD assessment is in percent of somewhere that for that I could access it is that correct that once it's uploaded you would have access to that yes like it's just within their file you would it'll like pop up like you know how to click on their number and then it'll pop out their whole uh no service lines the Danes at the bottom etc yeah yeah and it'll say it on there once it's entered there will be a line under full clinical target and it'll be labeled you know ROI-Kaishen okay because we have to have that in there and on file to receive that assessment so it has to be there once it's there it'll be there that makes sense okay all right okay so let's see because I see yeah Cassie hit me up and she was like asking me questions about like rule 25 assessments and this and and asked me like 10 questions and I was like okay I think you can do this and after actually giving her a bunch of answers I kind of clicked with me I was like wait a second we don't need to contact Kaishen to do anything if you don't need it updated so it's under uh let's see medical or something or is it under hold on a second um I'm about to pull up pull that up so I can tell you I need to look at somebody else's too now that I'm thinking about it um yeah so you click on their client number once it's highlighted and then that'll pop out a white a white screen that has appointments service lines clinical charting recent billings and recent payments and then authorizations so it would be in that third section the clinical charting okay I see a comprehensive assessment yeah and that's the same as a CED assessment correct I mean of course yeah yeah okay so then okay now I'm looking at it okay um oh wow this looks like something do they do do they do percent of as well like this looks like something I could change like if if I was really stupid I would change something on accident well why would you do that that's not what I'm trying to do but it looks like I could is that right I mean I don't want to change anything of course because that would be illegal but like how do I so I don't know I was just kind of surprised I didn't I expected to see like a photocopy version of it or something actually if you're actually in there can you can I can you just do this so I don't mess this up because I'm nervous already well hold on why are you even opening this up to look at it she needs a copy of it um sent to her public defender and she said to just email it to her um I don't know how to do that and I just pulled up to my client so I'm gonna have to get back to you I didn't realize that was where you were going with all this oh yeah I'm still sorry yeah it's okay I'll have to call you back okay all right that's cool all right I'll talk to you soon",

Sure. Hello, sorry about that. That's right. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Um, so I had a client of mine or a secondary. I'm a secondary person for this client. Anyways, she needs a CD assessment sent to her attorney. And she said that she could do it, um. But, and you just have an email to her. And I was like, given her instructions to her to call the or whatever, but then it clicked with me and I was like, oh, you know, obviously we have an ROI with them. So, I, we probably have a copy of that miles how to access it. And then when I accessed it, I was like, oh, my, like, this looks like. Like, beyond me, and I don't really want to mess anything up, so I just clicked out of it, but. Yeah, I don't her email should be on there and she's just requesting. To have a copy of it sent to her. Who what client is it? Oh, it's Cassie Jacobson stricker. Um, I can remember. Okay, so she's just wanting her assessment. Okay. Hello. See, is it. Cassie 1981. No, that's not what we have on file number. No, her client ID is 1981, but her email address. Oh, okay. Is it the Cassie 93 dot? K. J. I will check that's the 1 I have on record. So that's why I'm asking if that's the same 93. K. J. is that what you just said? Cassie 93 dot K. J. yeah. At Gmail. Yes, at Gmail. I can just confirm with her that that's her. So, you know, for. You. Things that. Breathe. I mean, I would imagine that it is still good. Yeah, definitely still good because it's not I know that she hasn't gotten a new phone recently and and wasn't that long ago she's messaging. Okay. It is I just I just sent it to her. Yeah, she says Cassie 93 dot KJ at Gmail. Yeah. Yep. Okay. Cool. Yep. Bye. Bye.",

You're ready to what? Uh I'm going through **** service like self service area. Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't know. It gets a little **** up right around here. Okay. Um how are you? How are you doing? How's your day? Have you heard from homeboy yet or what? No, he's not answering now. Hold on. I'm not going to panic this yet. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's going to be okay. It's going to be okay. I don't have to do all that. Alright. Yeah. But I'm going to yeah, I'm um Yeah. Um well, I was hoping to hear different or maybe I don't know. I'm sure like by the time I get there, it'll probably be **** I don't know. I'll try. I'll try to hit him up in a minute. Yeah. So, yeah, I guess like, alright. So, I'm just going to say this once and I swear to god. I'm not going to like freak out after this but like I'm like really worried like I'm not worried about like him but I'm like worried that what I might have to do like I really don't want to **** have to hurt anybody like I really don't and this is like the sort of stuff that this leads to and I like Tom but I don't want to have to kill Tom. I don't really want to have to hurt Tom. I **** like Tom. Yeah. Okay. So, let's not do that. Please don't do that again. I don't want to do that again. Like you give it to me. It's not even your fault. It's his fault. Yeah. Like it's yeah. Yeah. Sure. What if that was not? Well, I know I wanted to talk to you before I did it. Yeah. But I shouldn't I shouldn't I even get it because he's been flaky this whole time. I mean, it's going to it's going to be okay. I mean, I know I know for one thing's for sure. Like he's like not going to I don't know. I'm yeah, I'm just going to stay positive. I'm totally going to stay positive. He's uh he did give me his address and stuff. So, I don't know if that's his right address or what but I do have it. Yeah. He and he told me like uh one of the first times I talked to him like the other day. Um he told me that he lives somewhere like in Anoka area or something like that like. Yeah. Right by like the I don't I don't know what he said. It was like the library or something like that. Right over the bridge. I think out Champlain. It's it's like uh I got it written down. Hold on. That's good. That's that's all I need. I was I was work. It was good. Yeah. That's a good day again. Good. Was your boss in a good mood today? Yeah, he was. Yeah, it started out really good that uh yeah, I just like hate making mistakes and it's so easy to make mistakes in this in this job because there's a lot going into it and so every time I do make a mistake, I beat myself up a little bit. I think today I only probably made one mistake. I don't even know if I made the mistake. Yeah. No, it was yesterday. I did. I didn't. I don't think I made any mistakes today. So, can you tell me a little bit more detail about like like I know you like when you tell me when you told me like the first time, I'm only only really able to like keep keywords. I'm sorry. You're working like a yeah. I don't know. Maybe you you try it. I get it. Well, I celebrate parts. I don't sell. I don't do the selling. I do the distribution. Um I send it out in uh one of our couple of couriers we go through. So, DoorDash and priority and stuff. So, I get to delegate whether or not which service to use, how heavy it is, what um you know, I gotta put in all the the packages. I gotta count them. I gotta check the parts, make sure there's the right parts and then um and then I send them out and then I have to know the city which I you know, I only know Northeast and Columbia Heights and that side of the city, the north side of the city. I don't know I don't know anything south and so that's my downfall is so delegating where and what these where these people are going to go is really hard for me. I don't necessarily have to do most of the delegating because I just I put in the orders but I have to know, I have to put them in strategically. So, the people that do pick it will pick the right ones. So, I'll put in all the south ones at one time so that they'll give all that to one person. Otherwise, if their parts aren't delivered in within like 2 hours, they're calling and freaking out on you. Oh, yeah and so that's a little irritating but and then I work with a bunch of guys who are just most, I don't know. I like most of them but some of them are mean but I don't take no **** No **** taking Becky. So, mean define mean like I'm kind of interested to hear about this like it's because like they're they're they are they're married and they have like wives and they're like, yeah, they're like, I'm married. Yeah, they're like, oh, I'm like, what? You don't want to hit on You don't want to hit on me? Oh, **** It's stupid ice here. I can't even remember who who I am. I might lose you because I'm going down in my basement. Um but I'll call you. I'll call you right back once I get upstairs or upstairs. So, it should be like 2 seconds but you can go on. Go on. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Um I was thinking, I was like, I don't know who the **** I was. I was with but uh I've seen some like somebody that it's like, oh yeah, I think I remember it was some **** older old lady chick. Actually, I couldn't really tell if she was like an old lady or she's kind of like, I don't know what's going on because but she looked like an older older lady like kind of like **** Asian or something. I don't even know blonde hair and then like her age. We were, we were at the bar. The guy next to her was like **** six. Clearly, clearly like 60 years old. So, it made her look older but she when I went in the bar, she was like, just **** staring at me like would not stop staring at me. It was like, I was like, now that I, once I remember who I was, I remember now, I was I was with Zach but I was like, I was like, dude, is that **** **** staring at me right now? He's like, yeah. Yeah. And he thought it was like something to do with like the game that we were playing or something like that. I was like, I was like, I'm **** married. I don't know. I wanted to **** freak out. I don't know. I don't suppose that doesn't have anything to do with that **** story you just said. So, I guess that was dumb. Oh, I'm surprised the phone stayed. Crazy. There's some weird number just try calling me. I'm going to see what the I need to call them back or something. Yeah, you can go ahead. I'm I'm trying to finish and eat my burger. Okay. Yeah, you do that. Alright, bye. Alright, bye.",

    "transcript": "Hey, how's it going? It's going well, I was just sending a message. Can you hear me? Yeah. How about now? Yep. But you sound like a porn star now. I do. What does that mean? It went from a normal soft tone to a very, very deep and inappropriate tone. Shut the fuck up. Don't talk to me like that. You're in Broken Park or what? Yep, I'm at Tungsten. Yeah. I was just telling Cassie, it feels like I got ditched. Yeah? Weren't they all with me before? Yeah, earlier, yeah. Until I fell asleep sometime around noon-ish, I think it was, or nine-ish, or some shit this morning, and I woke up to them being gone in a disheveled living room. Who was that? Cassie and Zeke, and who else? Just Cassie, Zeke, Baron, myself, or my mom, trying to acclimate to the beast. Acclimate to the beast. Oh, I found out an answer to something important. Yeah, so there's this— What was the question? Well, I remember I talked to you, and I think I talked to you more of your mom. Like, I explained it more to your mom than I did to you, I think. I got to hear it, though. Oh, okay. Well, yeah, it was like a— Yeah, yeah. So my plan was to have you come down with Bear. I got to check out two of the different shelters here in St. Cloud. And both of them accept dogs. Yeah, there's like two of them. One of them is rather ghetto. I mean, they're both like a little ghetto, but one is like super— They're all going to be ghetto in some way, fashion, shape, form between the setting or the clientele or the staff, where everything will fall in line accordingly from that perspective. But I'll wait to talk to you in person on some questions I got, too. But, yeah, being in the St. Cloud area, I'm not too surprised. There's going to be a lot of youth and young adults, I would imagine. Youth and young adults, I imagine? Yeah, like 18, 19, 20. No, like 18, 19, 20, like college age. You mean like as far as like addicts and stuff? The people in the shelters. I don't know. They look like—I don't know. They look like—the people look like normal NPCs, you know? Yeah. Yeah, standard fucking VTA, you know, homeless person. NPCs seem to be accumulating a lot more in bulk. Yeah, I know. So the good thing about this other place, the place that I'm recommending is hopefully this place where my organizations actually can eventually partner with them because of me meeting with their program coordinator and all that shit. But one of the fucking amenities about that place is if you come in, everybody's welcome, and dogs are, too. And typically, once you register, do all their process, they give you a mat. And you're in the mat and in the hallway or in the lunchroom until your paperwork is done processing, which is usually a day or two. But if you come in and you're in treatment or you're affiliated with some sort of recovery, then you skip the floor mat in the hallway, and they put you in a room right away. Kind of hot-tracked or fast-tracked in there. Yeah. Yeah. And also, I remember, and I actually, I confirmed, like, you guys take dogs, right? Like, big dogs, whatever, and they're like, yes, but every dog needs to come in with a cage. Okay, I got a cage available. Okay. Okay. Yeah, man, I think it'd be a really good idea. So, I mean, I have talked to my supervisor about you, like, I don't know, I talked to him probably, like, twice. And one of those times, like, I think it was actually, like, the day after I got a call to you. And I was like, yeah, man, has anybody reached out to him? Like, he's just been sleeping, and he's a little bit off the map, and God knows what. And he's like, yeah. Well, I had a chance to, like, kind of explain to him some of the, like, thumb. I mean, I don't think I need a fucking, like, four hours at least to go over all the bullshit you got going on, but. Yeah, I don't know. But somebody, like, your mental health goals, the thing with your Rule 20, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, whoever you assign them to, like, it needs to be, like, really good. And I guess, like, the guy that they did assign you to was, like, lost his license for, like, a week or something. Because he didn't do something he was supposed to. But there is supposed to be somebody reaching out to you. Has anybody? You heard from anybody? Yep. Yep. Saturday, I think he said he's going to message me to remind me. And then we're going to plan something for, like, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, somewhere around there. Cool, cool. Yeah, actually. So I haven't mentioned anything about you going to St. Cloud for the weekend or whatever. I haven't mentioned it to anybody, like my supervisor or your primary yet. And I don't think I'd get in trouble for that sort of thing. In fact, I don't even think I would have to tell them that you were in St. Cloud or that I brought you to St. Cloud. Just leave that part out, maybe. I don't know. Okay. I don't know. It's whatever. I could speak about anything openly as possible with in mind of anything that's requested to be redacted. It's very easily done for me. We're speaking subjectlessly on a subjective subject. It's fucking like a God-given gift. Yep, whatever you just said, I believe it. Dave, when's the last time you heard from Doug? I sent him a message today trying to get a hold of him, and I haven't heard back from him yet. That's about the time that my phone fucking had died.",

I can't do nothing for you. You made miles away on your people. No, like I don't want to go to my people. Their prices just went insanely out of my reach and I'm like, **** that. I'm I got friends other other places. I'm not. Actually, it wasn't insanely out of your reach because I'm just a day like around 2000. I know, dude. That's the **** crazy thing.

Yeah. That sounds like no way to know you but that's how it **** up because there's no way to **** that **** crazy. But anyway, that's where that's that's where it's been at.

Sit right side. I'm sitting here with Sarah and my mom. I can hear you there. I can hear you there. No, I got you to my ear. Oh, okay. Can I do that for my mom's phone? Are you on it? I'm on my mom's phone where I can't get my phone to answer. I plug it in and it turns on and then it turns off because there's no battery charge to it and it keeps running that cycle on its own. I'm not prompting it to or anything. I don't know how to stop it from doing it. It will only turn on as soon as a charge is enough for it to turn on. And then it's like not enough charge for it to turn on and to start up. So it turns off again and it's like it that started up. It's been like four hours now. You're obviously not using a good charger, right? Huh? You don't have a good charger. I just got a brand new cord. And the block? My mom's big block. I've used all. So I guess if you know it's a good charger, if you like, you know, basically plug something else into it. Yeah. And you know that it's working. You know how the USB-C locks in? It won't lock in on my phone. You know how it clicks itself in? Yeah. It won't do that. One side will, but the other side won't, where it was in my pocket when that bottle blew up on me last night or this morning or whatever. I mean, it like literally exploded in my fucking pocket. Right. Like I said, I don't know if it was a combination of warm, fizzy fucking carbonation on the inside of the glass and the outside of the glass being like an immediate coldness. That when it got fucking like it, because it like blew up, like blew up, like it was underneath pressure, like explosion. Yeah. I was skating and it fucking kind of like wobbled me on my board. I'm curious how many have a bruise. It was just a glass bottle of fucking brandy that I poured fucking two cherry cokes into and fucking put in my pocket. It took off and within five minutes of leaving my mom's it fucking in my pocket as I was skating where it wobbled me off my board. But I mean like my phone was in that pocket. So like I think maybe glasses. I don't know. I can't see anything in there that's disrupting it. I do know that I can see inside parts of my phone and it was in the same pocket as a blown up fucking mixed drink. So I'm like, and this is the first time trying to charge it where it's stuck on that reset just turns on. It starts to Google the Google image symbol and shit. And then the screen pops up shutting down. And then the battery light will come on. And then soon as it starts.",

No, what do you mean? Where are you? Yeah, you said you said something like you you like woke up and you felt like they abandoned you. No, I have not reunited with them yet. I just sent her a message saying that seeing what the fuck did I say saying that I just got back from White Castle. No, then pretty much I said to you or just got back from White Castle now where I have I she was supposed to it's not it's not like she's supposed to meet Bria. She's not saying who but just just some person and making a point to say that she has to seek meet somebody or and avoid like it's I don't get it. It's stupid. Why even say anything if you're trying to like keep the information a fucking secret or because you're giving a secret away by saying a secret by keep like by being secret, you know. I mean, it sounds like I don't know. I know it's kind of it is kind of frustrating talking to her when she because I'm like so like sometimes so like like withhold information for me and like and I guess I understand it's like, you know mission mission and security or whatever you all that to me and it's me. It's funny because a lot of times it's it advertises or promotes more of a clusterfuck but at the same time, I'm saying now that's what I'm fucking saying. I'm like, dude, we're fucking we're all grown-ups here. Like but I don't think like we're like, I don't think we're selling children or anything like that. So, I mean just fucking say you're getting math. Everybody likes math nowadays. Anyways, we're not not not even just that but the fact of if you're trying to not talk about it, don't talk about it. Yeah, I know where in the that whole part where she's bringing something to somebody that isn't supposed to be doing something. I think this is what it is. You know what I mean? What now? I'm supposed now you're doing it to me. No, I'm saying like so if if fucking Johnny Bobby fucking blowhole isn't supposed to be doing anything and I'm going to go get him a sack. I can't say I'm going to go get so-and-so a sack. Where is it? And my curiosity is why I see anything say yeah, we're on our way out to go to somebody's house to do something and I'll be right back where I would assume that be right back whatever it is that you're going to be doing I would come in line after that. So anything more doesn't need to be said. So only I only have like I only have like 60 seconds to talk because I'm arriving at my I thought I'm going to get this thing open. Oh Mickey. Oh shit. I don't have a key. I just haven't fucking problem. The fob is a key. Well, yeah, but I don't think this door done about to get try to open works like that. Well, no, so let me get a walk on the way around the building or some shit. I'm a so let's see. Yeah, so I'm with Becky right now and I'm I'm but I yeah, the kind of I needed if I was going to bring you out to St. Cloud tonight. I was going to confirm that you have a fucking kennel for him. Yeah, it's at Doug's house and you're at Doug's and no, I'm not. I'm at my mom's. You just said that you were at Doug's now. I'm back at the house now. We're at my mom's. Just got back from White Castle. Where do you want to go back to? Oh my God. Do you want me to go to Doug's where I haven't connected or seen them since they left this morning where communication-wise I had just met talked to her spoke to her briefly, but she doesn't ever talk on the phone really and when she does it's hard to keep her attention. Sometimes but but but the lady that stays at Doug Tanya. She is not okay with having beer there and it was never brought to my attention until she writes my attention. So like I tried to not issue about that because when Doug because when Doug doesn't whenever Doug has a problem, he has no problem with me bringing beer over there. But if it him things are going well with him and the girl then it's okay. Yeah. Okay. All right. So this is I haven't even been there yet, but the kennel is there. I haven't gone there. You know where the kennel is like, yeah, when you get there and yeah. Like if we if you were to meet me there at a specific time, we'd be able to why would you save yourself in the few minutes? The two-minute drive versus the half-hour 45-minute walk for me. Yeah, that's a good point. Gotcha. All right. Yeah, I didn't think of that. Okay, but but but depending on the time that you're leaving from wherever you're at because it looks like you're down in the Rochester area. That's a lie. Are you close to like where how far are you from me right now? Like five minutes. Yeah. Okay. All right. Then I'll wait for you. My location. No, no, no, not leave not leaving now. Like I got I think I would say that she needed a car back by like eight o'clock. So it's like in and eight o'clock and it's like a little less than an hour. So seven so we need to get there at seven o'clock. So it's an hour from here. So that means we need to leave by I don't know about like 530, I guess. Yeah, so yeah, actually that doesn't work out pretty well because Becky has to go to work at 530. Anyway, so so so if you want to okay. Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to be at Doug try to be at Doug's at like 530. No, I'll be your house. I just pick you up at your house. Your mom's at 530 probably at five. Yeah, 530. Actually 530. Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Okay. And then also if I we he spent like a thousand dollars with somebody we were supposed to do stuff with yeah, sounds like so yeah, if you do hear from Doug or Cassie assuming that they may have something that could help here. Let me know because I think Becky would like to know that information because she's still trying to get rid of puppies, you know. Okay. All right. When I see in person, I'll get a better understanding, but I think I got the idea. Yeah, I'm pretty much if you hear from if they come over your figures from them, let me know before five. Okay, does he have it cash or is she trying to recover from the cash not coming back? She's I think she's trying to buy whatever Okay. Okay. Enough said Okay. But",

University. Yeah, if you just go, go on 94 towards St Paul you just, you get off on here on here on Boulevard. Yeah. It's like exit 235 be.

Yeah, I don't know. I actually don't mind going like days without but I'm like kind of geographically placed in a place that's now helps with that, I guess. Yeah, and your job and everything. It's like, I don't know, but at the same time, it's like a balance. I don't know. I just like to balance it out because there are days that I was like that I don't do it and I'll like just take my Adderall. And, um, but I do know one thing is like if I like just do nothing at all, like, I don't know I can't just do nothing at all because I like I'll go manic. I don't know it's fucking really. I'll lose my shit and I not know why. Anyways. Yeah, so I'm, I got a hold of fucking Phoenix, and she's some basically like two blocks away three blocks away I've never been to replace before. I don't know she's got a baby and she's sober but despite me being on my tweaker shirt right now she's gonna fucking have me come over and she's gonna try to get ahold of them and shit like that. I don't know she's actually super fucking helpful when it comes to doing that shit like that. And she's like fucking way better friends than that. And I don't know I'm sorry. I'm pretty hopeful about that. I'm trying to get happy to get out of fucking like having to do some stupid shit. And also, I looked at the fucking location of where you know that is. And I'm pretty certain that I know who is. Well I don't know who owns it but I knew somebody that stayed there and it was like Phoenix's ex boyfriend. And if it is, and if it was I don't know if that guy is still associated with it and I don't really fucking want much to go there. But I don't know. He said some Michelle lives there, Michelle. I don't know who that is. Yeah, he said that's the only person that lives there is a Michelle. Really, that's, that's Phoenix's real name. Okay, yeah. But like, like she's been everybody's called her Phoenix ever since she was introduced to everybody and she actually legally had a change recently when she got married to Phoenix. I don't know I wonder if he's like fucking with me I'm. What the hell, but I have Phoenix's location though. I'm a fucking freak out. I go over there, and I can see him over there. That's totally fucking the nature of this whole fucking thing I'll fucking flip out, but I don't think Phoenix's do that and Phoenix's got a baby, and I just talked to her the other day. And the other day before that. Anyways, I'll let you know what. I don't know what I do and I forgot to grab fucking Zach's fucking card. Did he ever come out and grab it. Do I know he never did. I know he said that he'd be interested in grabbing I was like yeah I bet you would fag. Okay. Well let's get ready I don't know call me when we also, I don't know, say something to Ivan, like maybe you should try to say something. Yeah, I am. Yeah, I'm going to tell you a little bit more text me or something. That fucking DMC shit was crazy. Yeah, did you like it. Yeah, I liked it. Yeah, definitely in a good way. All right, well, give me a call and you want to. I'll fucking see what I'll tell you what happens out here. I know that I have to be out of town, and by a certain time. So I'm hoping to get. I don't even know where I put his card. If I have curse, but I didn't see it in there. I don't know, I'm gonna get high, though, you could have left for a little bit and just came back when I woke up. You would have probably distracted me anyway. Say it again. I said you probably would have just distracted me. What work. No, I'm getting ready to work. Ready for. Oh yeah, that's what I do do I. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know if I can hang out with you unless we're fucking smashing I guess, I guess I'm just a fucking boy. Because I just go crazy insane. When we don't fucking bang. So, and I bug you. I probably myself a little bit. I don't know if I can. You almost got right here. Huh, you saw my map gas. Yeah, I'm sure was already gone pretty much. Dude, I'm only six miles away. Yeah. But what did you say that for. I don't know she can grab his card but I'd have to find it. And I'm not saying that to have sex. I don't want to come over there. But I don't know if I can. I really do. Bring it with you to work, I guess, I don't know. Damn it I do need to go back and get that. I don't know he's gonna be like pest. He's not gonna be pissed he's gonna be like probably a little excited because someone implies that he gets to go back over your house. Yeah, yeah I mean I would if I were you. I'll try to find it here. What are you saying, if I were you, you would try and find it there. There. You want me to look for it is actually. No, no, I said I'll look for it I said if I were you I'd come back here. All right. All right, if you find it, let me know. And I'll come back. Okay. Okay. All right. All right.

Um, no, we're Facebook, talking to you through Facebook, it's disconnected us a couple times in a pre-curious mid-conversation where I haven't been able to call you on your actual line. Yeah, yeah. Actually, the very first time it happened in the night, that was actually me f****** pushing the button. I was like, going to like get a hair off my, like off the screen or something, I was like, oh my gosh. And for it to keep happening in a weird situation and the way that I've experienced that, my concern of Facebook sitting there calling in pedals when pedals are doing something that's not congruent to being productive of the government or them f****** being okay with it, if they're being good boys, I'm not okay with that. But if they're just downright making judgment calls, this is a good person, or this person's f****** around. I've got a f******, I've got a, um, a man in the middle of two scanner detector on my phone that I made sure was running last night because I was actually, I heard about a concern regarding somebody else that has nothing to do with me at all but it was like somehow connected to Becky. So I was a little worried. So I turned that f****** scanner thing on on my phone and yeah, I made sure it was working. It must've been pretty f****** busy after hearing about and seeing the lady get shot in the face down on the south side where I'm sitting out there and I was kind of curious on what all the f****** excitement was because you could hear sirens for a good while and then at the same time at about f****** midnight, I think it was, we were driving through there when we had spoke to you. At that point in time, I still had no idea what the f****** happened. After talking to you, the morning coming around of the night that you tried to get me to come out with the pizza and stuff or whatever, it was that following morning when I heard and saw it where I had f****** no goddamn idea that that s*** happened when it happened where I'm surprised that the guy didn't, I'm surprised the officer was able to get out of there. Yeah, that's what I said. That part of Lake Street, I was shocked that nobody, but just someone, anyone to actually be there to observe it, I'm surprised somebody wasn't carrying it to just start opening fire on them. So you're at Doug's right now? Yeah, I am at Doug's and I got two, three options for you to pick from when you get here to actually sit down and talk about it. So I can't make any transactions and it's not even me, it's Becky, but she doesn't get off work until five o'clock tonight. I met, I introduced her to f****** our Southern gentleman and then the guy that f****** like has been, he's kind of helping them out in this area, the white guy, his name is Tom. And yeah, I know I f****** known them both for a decent amount of time and f****** I, yeah, I don't know f******, I don't know why anybody did this. I wasn't there, but f****** Tom did this whole, hey, I'm going to go run down and grab it and I don't have any money. Like, can you give me whatever you got? And she's like, yeah, okay. And she gives him a thousand dollars and then she calls me right afterwards. I'm like, and she's like, yeah, I just gave him a thousand dollars and blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, okay. I mean, I don't think that that's a good idea because that's like not good practice. Like, I don't even know. I mean, yeah, I trust the guy, but like at the same time, he's not human. I mean, he's not God. Like, you know, something happens to that money. See, if it ain't guaranteed, I'm not grabbing the right money. Yeah, dude, I feel like I don't know why. I don't know why she did it. Has there been any chance? Well, I'm guessing she did it because of word of mouth and just having faith because of you. And I'm guessing it happened because if it's that for the first time or that experience, that's an open lick. I don't know. Here's the deal. Like, I honestly like, I fucking, I actually do believe that he, because the details that he shared with me are all actually consistent with what I know the operations actually are. I mean, because he said, I mean, it made pretty good sense to me. Like basically he was supposed to go to Iowa yesterday and, you know, drive out there and meet with two of the workers, you know, the Spanish ones who fucking pretty much do whatever the fuck they want, not listen to any fucking news story. The workhorse. No. So, yeah, Tom was supposed to go out to Iowa because the, you know, Jefe is fucking workers. You know, he has his Spanish speaking workers that don't speak English. They fucking, he trusts them and he won't let anybody else fucking bring it up here besides them, which is fucking stupid to me. But I don't know, a while ago, a couple of months ago, he, when I told him I had expressed interest in fucking going down there and doing some of that running. And he's like, and he kind of shared with me some details about this Kansas City. It's like, we're kind of like the, one of the drop-off spots where like it needs to come up. Kansas City is the shipping hub center of America where that's every fucking, every East Coast, the West Coast, pretty much has to stop there or somewhere in Texas or up in Minnesota where it's, I think it's like the I-94, I-80 and then I-65 or some shit. And then whatever the fucking one is that goes down on the southern portion. I don't even really fucking, I don't know, I've never really thought about Kansas City in my life. I just thought it was actually kind of weird. There's a Kansas City and then there's like a, what is it? There's two Kansas Cities. Yeah, that's what I'm fucking saying. Yeah, there's a Kansas City and a Kansas City and they're like, I was like, oh shit, which one am I supposed to go to? But I think they're only a half hour apart from each other anyway, so. They're across the river, right across the river. But dude, you know that Kansas City is like six hours away? Yeah. I used to work down there. That fucking blew my mind. I was like, dude, because I was thinking it was gonna cost like $600 to get there. No, it's like a tank of gas. Like going to Chicago. No, it's like a tank of gas. Yeah, dude, that's what, so I'm like thinking to myself like, why the fuck don't I just like, so anyways, back to the question and story. It's actually two tanks of gas. You come to the tank there and a tank back. Yeah, six hours, six hours. But I was gonna say, so basically what Tom told me is like, he was supposed to go out to Iowa and meet these guys. And you know, he was waiting, waiting. And then there was like, I don't know, some sort of like, he wanted, they wanted him to give, they wanted him to give the money over without getting anything. So he like came back and he didn't, this whole time he like, I don't know, he sent me like a message like at five in the morning and he said, he's like still on his way back. He sent her a message at like midnight or something like that. Kind of saying that he was good or something like that. And he's coming back. I don't know, it's just the lack of communication is kind of fucking, kind of does it for me. But he's, I don't know, does that whole like, anyways, I don't know. So I already kind of have a plan to handle that. If he doesn't like want to comply, which is stupid because I don't fucking like, I don't want to be mean to somebody that I fucking just got done saying that I trust and all that shit. But obviously there's like a level of disrespect that needs to be fucking established. Well, here, actually, this is actually kind of, you guys might be funny. It's not, it's not even masochistic. It involves kidnapping a dog. Yes, it is. 100% involves kidnapping a dog. That's what the person. Actually, it's better than a child. Yeah, I know. That's fucking, that's fucked up. I would never kidnap a child, but I. But people would. That's not the point, Zach. Get your head out of the clouds. I don't want you to go thinking negatively upon yourself by doing something that's not. I mean, I think I'm fine. I'm just irritated that I have to do it because it's like, I don't know. It's like kind of like, you know, that feeling when you got to beat your wife and you're like, why, why did you make me do that? I'm just kidding. You got to, you got to beat, you got to beat your wife after introducing her to your friends for the first time after you just got done talking her up the whole entire time that you've ever known, known your wife to your lifelong friends and then to have to beat her and ask her why she made you do it. Where you catch her fucking your friend. Nobody knows. What are you talking? You were so high. This is like a long distance phone call. My brain just got fucking. All right. Anyways, sorry. That was a lot. There's a run on sentence. You're a fucking glitching right now. I could tell. I'm drooling. I'm drooling for sure. Oh my God. It's not my fault. It's the surgeon. She wants to see me again. That's why the surgery failed. That's why you keep taking your shit apart. You sucker. I was standing outside.

So I thought I heard you say, but. I wanted to hear it again. Okay. We want to do. Hold on one second. Wait, no, I got. Our search. At home. So what's up? What is it? What's the deal with? Oh, boy. I was going to ask you if you would talk to him. If he hadn't reached out to you at all. Tom at all. Yeah, I guess he just hasn't. I guess he's what? I guess he has. Has he not hit you up or anything? He has not. Yeah. He messaged me up and said that. I'll forward you. I'll forward it to you. I'll forward it to you. Hold on. Let me. I don't want to. So that's what he said to me. I don't know what he said to me. But either way. I mean, he keeps saying that it sounds like it's good. So. Like they had. I think fix the problem. Huh? I don't know. What are you saying? Still fits the problem. That it was like going down. Whatever you read it. You read it. He's lying about that. He's lying about he is. Yeah, because I haven't just told me that we don't. We don't take money without giving products. So we don't like. He says we don't. We don't give. We don't take money without giving a product. Word for word. He says. I don't know. He's saying that he didn't even. Give it to them. They wouldn't have done that until they had the products in their hands. Right. So they don't do it like that. Yeah. Because he told me that's how they've been doing it. I think he's pulling a fast one. I don't know. I sense. So. I don't know. I'm confused. I'm a little confused because. Okay. I know that I totally framed this in the beginning so that like, this is like, however you want to run this and operate this. I wasn't going to be like over your shoulder. Yeah. I don't want you to feel like I am right now, because the only reason I'm still. I guess. That's important for me to say, I guess. What was I going to say after that? Such a space case. I don't even have plans to go pick him. Pick up or. He was just lying about the whole thing. No, no. I think it is. You're you're you're right. And I'm right. Like, what are you saying is lining up. I don't know. I don't know. He still shouldn't have taken that money from me. And I feel like the fact that he did. It was just like, like. Now you must've needed it for something else. Yeah. Like what. I'm thinking that's what it is. I mean, it's not like. You didn't have my permission to do anything with. Right. Yeah. Sorry. Super fucking. But. And also. I don't know. What can I. What can I do. Was he going to pay me back. Sounds like this thing. So, sounds like Ivan is saying, like, I don't know. I just told him. I just told her, but I'm like, all right, this is the time to like, explain to me everything. Not like little bits of it. Right. Yeah. I think his next message could be totally wrong, but I think his next message is going to be like, telling me the details about, you know, going out there. And if he doesn't go out there, I'd be welcome to go. It sounds like he's welcoming me to go out there and grab. Are they going to give you a vehicle? No, I don't know. Well, I don't know. They should have that shit figured out, I guess. Maybe they should. I don't know. On TV, on YouTube, they'd like to drive, like, rental cars all the time. But I guess if you get pulled over with a rental car, they're immediately suspicious of you. All right. Well, anyways, yeah, well, I'll feel it out. But I mean, yeah, I guess basically what I've gathered so far is Tom has kind of gone rogue a little bit. I think he took advantage of our conversations and circling around trusting him. And I know that with you, you have total autonomy to, like, talk and say whatever you want to these guys. But I think he kind of may have worded things in a way that, like, he didn't want me to hear him say that to you on purpose. Because if I would have heard that, I would have told him no. Right. I don't know. Well, don't say anything to him that you know. Because I'm going to just play it as whatever and make him meet up with me. Or I can swing it another way and make him think I want to hang out with him. Here's one thing I know Tom is good at. If he wrongs you today and four weeks or six months or three days, like, he'll come through. And like I kind of said earlier, it's kind of hard to be angry at the guy who's got a bunch of dope. But yeah, that's not today, I guess. That's not today? Yeah, I mean, he's not that guy today. So I'm feeling kind of angry at him. I feel like he probably, I mean, like you were saying, like, he probably, like, took money. And I don't know if he spent a bunch of it on gas to get out there. I really don't know. We can only speculate. But it wouldn't make sense if, like, in a, I don't know, I'm just using my intuition. But then again, it's just fucking irritating, you know. I don't know if I can get that money back. Yeah, I'm saying, like, yeah, all right. Sorry, I'm going to let you go. Yeah, yeah, I'll get the money back. Sorry, bye, bye, bye, bye.",

Get out of here. You got the baby swinging on you? Yeah, dude, he just walked up to me and squared up with me. Dude, he fuckin', dude, he, uh, he, uh, went potty in the potty for the first time yesterday. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. And then, now, he did that yesterday, now today he thinks he's a fuckin' man. Nah, I'm just kidding. I, yeah, he was like in his little red robe right now and he's fuckin', I don't know. Anyways, hey, how's it going, guys? Hey, how's it going? I can't understand you. You sound like a, you sound like the voices in my head. I can't understand you. No, it's too, too quiet or something. I don't know what's going on. Where's my other fuckin' earbud?

Damn, dude, I can fuckin' feel you there, dude. Super confusing. You get the body, so it's confusing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't know if you have something to do or didn't. Or if you want to do something or you have the motivation to do something, but you got the motivation. Just confused. Yeah. Is that, is that about me? A little bit? No. Oh, okay. Alright, I was gonna say that. Yeah. Yeah. So, so what I was telling you earlier was, you know, it's good that if she is getting off at that certain time, that by the time bro make the call, hopefully everything will be there. So when she, y'all get there, everything will be fine again, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. And I just gotta stay, and I just gotta stay on Doug's ass so he don't try to sleep all day, because he just wants to go take a nap. So. That's true. Yeah, so it's really interesting that you say the word of the day is fucking confusing. No. That most definitely resonates with me. Fucking, so I don't know if I kind of, if you, I don't know if I'd like, were you around if I, when I fucking explained that I was like, oh shit, try to find some, somebody to like introduce my people to and whatever. Yeah, I know. And, well, first it was going to be Becky, and then she kind of lost her mind, and then it kind of came back briefly. You got 10 minutes left in the line. Oh shit. I don't have much time. What? Oh. Sorry. No, she was asking if you got $10 for something you can borrow. Do I? Cassie was asking if you got 10 bucks you can borrow, so she can do her phone. Yeah, yeah, well, right. Is Chime okay, or Cash App, or what is that? Either one. Okay. Either Cash App or Cash Chime. Okay. Oh yeah, basically, I don't know, dude, I could actually just fucking, yeah, Becky and fucking, these guys kind of pissed me off a little bit. They just made things really difficult all day long. Like, uh. You've got a minute left. Huh? No, she's talking about that. And no, I get what you're saying, because that will be frustrating when a person, like, move on accordingly to what you told them to, you know what I'm saying? And then they just, like, jump out on that man. And then you got to hit them with the, that's on you, that's your problem, I told you so type shit, but then that's when it goes where they just say fuck everything, you know what I'm saying? Be butthurt about it. Yeah. You know. Yeah, that is kind of pretty close to the version. Yeah. I mean, I guess mine's like the European version or something to that. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That's why I always tell motherfuckers, you can't be patient and give it a second, and let me do the magic that I'm trying to do for you, and you jump off and go down the street somewhere, that's on you. Don't call me back to get the other one. I feel like you're wasting my time. You know what I mean? Like, I tell my brother, like, keep shopping yourself, because I just try to, you know, introduce you to the shit to where you're good, but then all of a sudden you decide to go the other route because you were being impatient and your people wanted you to either get the shit first and then, you know what I'm saying, come to them. It doesn't always work that way. Yeah. I mean, and I be trying to explain it to some people, like, when you want that shit, and you trust the person that's middleman and shit for you, trust them. Yeah. You're with them. Trust them. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. You know what I mean? Because, like, me, I trust my people like with Doug. I put him in with my people without even an introduction. I just did the introduction over the phone and joined. That's it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And when he got out, he went to Doug first. Pissed me off a little bit because it set me back on my other, you know what I'm saying, circle. I deal with shit like that, but after a while, I kind of got pissed off, and I snapped on him, and my brother was like, y'all got the game fucked up. Like, it ain't supposed to be just one person doing shit. It's supposed to be a trio. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I don't know if I was able to kind of share with you a little bit. I mean, me and Becky were, you know, planning on grabbing from our, you know, our guy from down south, and that's what we thought was happening. And his representative met with Becky in person, and I wasn't there, but I made the acquaintance on the phone. This was on Wednesday. Yeah. And basically, I don't know, they met, and then she ended up calling me afterwards, and she's like, yeah, da-da-da-da-da. And I gave him $1,000 because he needed it to go blah-blah-blah. And I was like, so you gave him $1,000 without getting anything in return? Right. And she's like, yeah. Is that okay? Is that, like, a good deal? Can I trust him? I was like, well, I mean, whether or not, yeah, I mean, yeah, we can trust him. We can trust him, but, like, I mean, that's just generally a bad practice because, you know, whether he's trustworthy or not, like, it's going to be hard for me to convince you that he is in a fucking two days when he's fucking, yeah. Good talk. And then, like, she fucking, so she spends, like, the whole next 48 hours, like, kind of with me because I'm, like, trying to, in her defense, like, make sure that she gets that money back or whatever. And I'm, like, sitting here thinking, like, okay, worst case scenario, I'm going to fucking kidnap his dog. You know that fucking, you know that fucking 50 cent expression? Yeah. I'm going to spray his mom's caribou and make his ass look for me. Yeah, for me. Yeah, I mean, that is about the kindest way of doing that in that form, but now I'm an asshole. Right. And then you kind of find out, like, I don't know, after they share some text messages, like, with me, and I'm kind of reading, like, the main part, but then I read the second part, I'm like, like, both of their text messages kind of begin and end with, like, just between us. And I'm, like, oh, I see. I see. It's not, like, I don't know. They're just kind of whatever. I'm just going to pray for them and I'm going to step out. So, that being said, I, like, yesterday she was, Becky was fucking super hurting for fucking all this weight and she does need it, but I don't know how much money she has, I think. I'm pretty sure she does have some good money, but she is still, like, I don't know. It's, she's frustrating me and it's, I mean, I could have, if you guys are still willing to meet her after hearing that she has frustrated me, that is totally, it's totally something you're willing to accept. Yeah. Does that make sense? Yep. Yeah. I have no problem, like, introducing you guys and I hope, and actually, I know, I think Cassie already knows Becky, like, slightly. Cassie doesn't like Brie. Brie and Cass, or, no, I'm sorry, I meant Becky and Brie do not get along. Like, Becky does not like Brie. Is she short? Yeah. I think I know her. Maybe you do know her. I don't know. She is kind of popular in some circles. Was she on a case with the whole Yogi and HP and shit? Yeah, I think so. The fucking, the kidnapping and the fucking, yeah. She knows me. Yeah, she knows you. She knows me real well. Well, fuck you, Zeke. Maybe you will be best friends with her then. No, I know, because she used to date Jason and Matt Levine's cousin. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, she's my Becky most of the time, but I don't know, ever since she kind of got back into smoking, she's kind of everybody's Becky, so. Yeah, she's good people, though. Yeah, she is, she is, she's like a sweetheart, I love her, but I'm freaking out. Yeah, people be fucking trying to, you know, get over on her and manipulate her because she's always used to doing shit for everybody. Yeah. She used to be one of them, I'm a fit in type chick, if you need me, I'm here type shit. And then they used to always bully her or run off with her money or her car and all that shit. And then she finally got away from a lot of them and then that Yogi shit happened and it was like. Yeah, I was actually just talking to her not too long ago. Yeah. A little while back when I seen her online. Yeah, well, she hasn't been introduced to Doug and all them metal things, so. No, she don't know Doug. Yeah. Only people that she don't know that I know is the old team Deep No Sleep crowd. Yeah. But, you know, that crowd is no longer around like that, so. Yeah. Dude, I think I actually have, like, usually Sundays I have like a family day. Yeah, yeah. But I think that tomorrow is going to be like my first day, like that I don't have a family day. So I am kind of like vexed because I like to have my boys with me anyways. But if you wanted to, I don't know if you had like one of those car projects or something like that, that you wanted some attention on, whichever you point me in the right direction, we can work on something. Right. If you think it would be helpful. Right. Otherwise, I got like a tranny that I got to do in St. Cloud and if I can fix up a mothership in St. Cloud sometime this week. My shit is sitting at Gamma's. Yeah? I moved it already from my dad's to Gamma's. Oh, he let you move it without, like, transferring the title and all that? No, I got the titles in my name. Oh, OK, OK, that's good. Yeah, I got all that done. He tried to jump on me when he thought I wasn't going to make it to moving it. And I just said, fuck ordering the tow truck. I just fucking tow strapped it. Yeah, I could look it up on my phone to see what it was. Actually, I think that's what I would have to do. I think it was a little more than what came up because you remember it was the fucking, they said, head gasket. Yeah. It originally was a starter that was being fucked with. But then, like, it wasn't holding no power because the fucking, the negative and positive is acting weird on the truck now all of a sudden. Yeah. Which I think it could be a fucking, a ground, a ground, fucking one of those grounds. Yeah, it is. You know, I have my fucking truck that went down, and I'm kind of curious if my motor is compatible with yours. Like, it might be, but I got to check the VIN numbers, which just take me. It is. Your truck is a. Mine's not a Vortec, but it is a five three. Mine's a Vortec and it's a five three. Yeah, yours is a Vortec and yours is a five three. But I'm going to look at the, I'm going to compare the VIN numbers, and I might even have to call the fucking dealership to find out for sure. The dealership's right there on fucking looper. Can I put you on a brief hold? I'm going to fucking call the dealership real quick. It's working. Okay. Okay. Chevy dealership. Thank you for calling ID Chrysler. Press one for sales. Press two. I didn't hear what the. Thank you for calling ID Chrysler. Press one for sale. Press two for service. Press three for parts. Press zero. That's so loud. What year is your thing again? 2004 or something. Oh, five. Oh, five. Okay. The voice mailbox for this user is full. They cannot receive new messages at this time. Goodbye.",

If anything, the transmission would come out of that vehicle, the one I just gave you, and go into the next one, if that was a thing. But we haven't even talked about that. We're just kind of... Anyways. And then the VIN number for this next vehicle is... Okay, it is... The last four... The last eight is... J22... Oh, hold on. 7J2... 25040. Shit. Was that eight? I can't really tell. I don't have my glasses on. And then the 07 Yukon. This is a 07 Chevy Suburban. Okay. All right. Looks like... These are different codes. They would not be applicable for a switch. Okay. So, for the engine, no. And for the tranny, no. For the engine, no. For the tranny... That one's an LM7M30. LM7M30. Okay. So, the LM7M30 is applicable for the transmission on both vehicles. But different part numbers show up for your... The full trans part number. So, on the 07, it's showing me the part number 89037517. You should have the transmission part number 89037517. But it is applicable to the RPO code M, like Mama 30. But then your 05 transmission part number should be 89037492. Because you guys share the M30 RPO code, you might be able to weasel something from one to the other. But the transmission that your VIN determines is a different part number with different applications. Okay. So, I see. So, like the four-wheel drive selector switch that goes on the transfer case, that's not compatible. Okay. Correct. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. I think that's all the further we wanted to get for now. Okay, sir. All right. Thank you. Thank you for all that. Have a great rest of your weekend. Yeah, you too. Bye. Thank you. Bye.",

Like when I hung up on the first place, it Yeah, yeah, no. That are different, like, have to be like, kind of, some are compatible, some are not right. But, um, yeah, yeah, she was like, when I like told her what we're what I wanted to do, she's like, I'm not gonna be able to go into this like all day. I get done in my half hour. I was like, no, I just need to know, like, two different things. Yeah. Yeah, so, so, so you say just the transmissions? Yeah, just just our transmissions are compatible. But like, just like the core of it is like the the 4L60E is like, basically the, the core, but like, they're the parts that are like, kind of in between, like, we got different transfer cases, and we have different four wheel drive selector switches. But, um, yeah, but they can be like, kind of swapped out to, like, make a working unit. Right. That's a year older mining. Yeah, mine's actually 2006. So here's the 2005 GMC Yukon. Mine's a 2007 Chevy Suburban. Yeah. They were probably compatible. Well, maybe if it was a, maybe if it was a 05, I mean, a 07, yeah, they'd probably be compatible. This is kind of like they've switched them around, like some models, like, is yours, is the Vortec an E85 vehicle? I think so. Yeah, it is actually. Yeah, yeah, those are nice. That's nice. Because fucking, I had to put gas in a fucking SUV that takes that much. Like, it can't be fucking expensive. Otherwise, I'm stressing you out. Or you'd be doing gas and goes like I did all last two years. Right? Yeah. Um, all right. Now, I'm only got a full tank of gas. I'm gonna say that. You guys still got I still got the fucking the magnetic plate in my truck. That like if I want it, I just like put it just clicks right on there. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. All right. Oh, you're okay. See? Yeah, I was just gonna it's it's 349. I'm probably gonna try to Oh, wait, I can't relax. I actually got to go outside and I got to do like an oil change and some shit. But yeah, I don't know. What do you you want to rethink it about? Do you have time like tomorrow or to get on your truck and at your grandma's? It's like, it's like, Oh, it's like Cassie Graham. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yep. So I've just been patiently trying not to kill it. I'm like, I'm gonna kill it. Yeah, shit. I actually now I'm fucking with it being as fucking cold as it is, man. I shouldn't be so like gung ho to be like, yeah, let's go do shit outside for hours. So I mean, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I don't I'd rather not because I don't know. I just come there. I try to come in as fucking prepared as possible. You seem like Yeah, dude. Yeah. Shit. That shit actually fucking was really, really nice. Like, when I was out there the other day when I was fucking super sick, and I'm like playing Twister. I should have something. All right, well, I'm gonna let you go. So you want me to go to give her phone number or if I can call you back? Yeah, yeah, you can do that. Or just or you can tell her to check her page. And I think we are friends. Yeah, yeah. Okay. And just sort of page or whatever. She could just call. Yeah. Oh, sounds good. And does Zach want me to come and get him? I remember saying cloud. Is that like a still? I mean, because I can actually I can actually get sit with him on the phone and fucking do that. HRA thing. Hold on. Here's that. Hey, how's it going? It's going on. I'm picking up trying to locate Cassie's EBT card while eliminating the destruction afflicted zone that I recreate and disrupt and recreate your on circle cycle. Where I'm being efficient, I'm taking care of three things in one time simultaneous act of doing one thing. I can tell you're fucking talking weird again. I can feel your brain cell fucking like rumbling. Like it's like like one of those fucking Nintendo 64 controllers. And what's coming out is the reverberation of the undigested fuel that was consumed that is not all my gosh, I gotta take I don't know why your, your voice sounds like a fucking guitar sometimes. Or meals on the chalkboard. So that's a lot of vowels. I don't know what to make out of it. So, so I was gonna say, do you still are you still trying to go to St. Cloud? Like, because I made the determination that I can actually apply for the HRA program like online. Like, I could do it with you right now. Yeah, that's an option. If you want to wait until later, or let me call you back when I'm done doing this. So I You got to quit. You don't got to do anything but think or talk. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, I get it. I get it. No, no, no. You're gonna get you're getting a good mental workout. You should keep on doing whatever it is you're doing. Yeah, yeah, I totally feel ya. Okay, um, I'm actually gonna Zeke's gonna take care of getting ahold of her. Because she is kind of pissed me off a little bit for the day. So, okay. Yeah, okay. Okay. All right. So I'll just give you a call later. Okay. That are you back at home tomorrow? Or are you? Yeah, yeah, I'm in more. Yeah. Okay. Well, enjoy your time playing daddy. And anything else can occur when I hear from you or when I let you know that I'm done here. And to move further forward. As of going to St. Cloud, I don't have any opposition against it. Doesn't have to is it? Are they going to be able to do if we were to do that tomorrow or tonight or whatever? Is there going to be the staff to do the paperwork, whatever? Because it's the weekend or is it best to go on Monday where I got court Monday? You got court Monday in Stearns County? No, I had court Monday in, I think in Noka. Yeah, then we can wait until later. I just like initially, I kind of thought that it would be online. But if you do need like, to do one of those, this like the ID, birth certificate, whatever vouchers, if you do need one of those, then I think we got to go to some place out, make an appointment out someplace in St. Cloud, because you can only do the one at the Basilica like once a year. Voucher for the license ID or voucher? Yeah. Which one? Okay. Well, I got the ID stuff. The voucher for housing or hotel housing supplement vouchers for the, the shit you're talking to me about, about going to the Sheriff's Department to get a hotel room for fucking the wintertime or whatever. Oh, yeah. I don't know. Yeah, yeah. Okay, go ahead. I've been seeing a lot of posts or links of signing up or requesting it, where I've never seen that opportunity before. But hearing about it from you last year, two years ago, I'm seeing that now being offered. And I don't know if it's like a fucking, get you to surrender all your information and run with it. Or if it actually has a conclusion, because some of the stuff that I've attempted to do, this puts me on another survey or another Q&A type aspect. I'm sorry, you lost me. You lost me. What is this? What? I feel like I missed the first. The homeless hotel voucher form or whatever, was being advertised on Facebook. And I just that what is on Facebook doesn't necessarily mean it's a legitimate thing. And I've never gotten any further into looking into that hotel voucher thing. After trying to stop that the fucking Sheriff's Department with you actually requesting for a voucher for a hotel room by having you tell me the story. And I reiterate that to the officer as if it was my story. And how I'm curious, as I'm looking into that for myself, after talking to my buddy who just had that done for him out of town last night, walking home from wherever the fuck he was walking home, the story that you told me, or whatever. Yeah, yeah. I told you a story about a person, a friend getting stuck out of town and not having a way. Yeah, I remember. Yeah, that's what I told the sheriff's, I think it was in Anoka County. And they told me that I was received a lot of hot air blowing up my ass. So I hope I enjoyed the story. Where it was a really, really rude, but funny way that the secretary had said it. Yeah, I think I did. We did already determine that Anoka doesn't do it. But, uh, there are still some other counties. I think they're more like suburb ones that may do it. I don't even fucking know. I'm gonna hold on. Hold that thought. I'm gonna fucking ask it. Yeah, somebody somebody. But I don't even want to ask you ask a question. I just got my phone to turn on for me to have two conversations with you back in a very brief moment where I just got to my mom's house. Boom, third, third conversation. Hey, I want you to I can send you a text message that had a screenshot in it and of those tiles. Yep, yep, yep, yep. I was talking about the two tiles or four tiles or whatever. Yeah, yeah, it's the two flat ones and the two fucking regular ones. Send me money so that I can get those things for us and send me money for a fucking phone case for you a phone case and me a phone case and fucking you probably need a new phone pretty soon. That or get the replacement glass for it to save everything on it for working properly. But it needs to be clean since it was next to the pop that exploded. And in that cleaning, you have to do when you replace the glass anyways, that I don't know if I can replace the black black back glass part of it. But the back that back glass doesn't really do much besides feel whatever. That's a digitizer. So that's a digitizer. It goes a digitizer. Yeah, that's the digitizer. And then the screen goes on that digitizer like fucking does the touch. Yeah, the glass on on that backside is chipped away and crack, but you can't see any internal phone components where you can see inside the phone from the actual screen side. Yeah, um, you know, actually, but it's really expensive. I can really think it's really it's like so expensive that it's almost not worth it to purchase a new perk like get it fixed. But if you are able to do the work or find somebody that's able to do the work. Or find somebody that's able to do the work. I Justin Justin. What the fuck I just closed my eyes and now I forgot what I was saying. It's about $50 cheaper to get the glass replaced. If you take it to a repair shop, but at the same time that $50 of it being cheaper of it being fixed versus spending the $50 more to get the same exact phone for the price that we got it for. Yeah, that's what I was gonna say. There is there is that fucking option is anyway, do you do you just say put a fucking thing on on the wound or something like that? What? I like to put many things on other people's moons. Nevermind. Look at it. Every time I fucking close my eyes, I close my eyes for a split second and my mind just go my words. Like completely incoherent. That means that you need to rest your brain for a moment and sit there with your eyes closed until something outside auditorily and get some open. I know you're right. You're right. But I'm gonna do that. But I'm gonna do that because I want to do it. Not because you recommended it. Where it's a lot easier to achieve what you're trying to attempt to succeed. If you were to fill the tummy first. Yeah. And also put my like put both my hands in freezing cold water for like 10 seconds while breathing in and out. Yeah. I think that would be the one way to actually open your eyes wider. So I don't know if that will aid or assisting in closing them until they open naturally. It's supposed to be it's supposed to like initiate. It's like a force close. It's like a force close for like your brain where basically restarts it. Anyways, I got some stuff I want to do and I'll talk to you later. Okay. All right. Do you want one of us to call at five or are you staying the whole time? Yeah. No, Zeke's got it covered. He'll make contact with her. Yeah. All right. I'll just talk to you soon. Okay. I'll talk to you either when you wake up or tomorrow. Sounds good. Okay. Bye.",

It's creating, creating an issue that doesn't need to be created. Yeah. Yeah. He said, oh, he said, hey, can you talk to Brandon? He's talking to Omegle again.

He's using, I said it was a little frustrating that he's using you to talk to me. Oh yeah. It's super frustrating. Um, but I mean, yeah, the whole idea of, of introducing everybody was so that, you know, you guys could work together. So, I mean, I, it would be silly to assume that I need to be a part of every conversation. It's just, um, I guess just the weird nature of it. This was kind of, I don't know, confusing and that.

I think my, my thing with you right now is that we've just got, I don't know these other thoughts going through my mind and just about the amount of commotion, that noise that are in our, in this environment. So I don't know. So maybe just hit me up later. I don't know. I, uh, yeah. All right. We can talk more about it later. Are you working tonight? Yeah. Okay. I'll call you. Well, I was going to say, if you, if you were still looking for stuff, um, well, Zeke said that he was going to get ahold of you. I, cause you like claimed that he's like, when I said that, I don't know, I don't know if I'm going to get ahold of you. I don't know if I'm going to get ahold of you. I don't know if I'm going to get ahold of you. Um, not even when I referred to meeting with you earlier, and he said that he might know you. He's pretty sure that he knows you. Uh, maybe, but he's got a bunch of, he's got, they went and basically got a bunch of stuff and it's with them now. And if you want, if you do need some, you can, go meet with them and they got it.

What do you hear me somebody that we know you sound like you've got a big cock in your mouth. I understand. Are you with that? That kid is terrible. I really need to quit making so many phone calls laying down. I just don't want to get up. Uh, whatever. Well, you're mumbling so you better get up. God damn it. So, um, did you ever fucking grab whatever the fuck are you still useless? Nope, I'm good. I got it. So can I send somebody within the community to your place? Um, no, because I need to keep the traffic down, but I don't even know. Something like that. Probably a small amount. Yeah, no, not for a small amount. I'll send him somewhere else. That's fine. I mean, I'm not. I mean, well, I mean, you know who it is. I don't really. Who is it? Corey. Oh, man. I mean, tomorrow. You know, does he have a car? Yeah. I don't know. That makes me feel shitty. I can send him someplace else because, um, yeah, I mean, it might be a little bit more awkward since you guys do know each other. I don't know. It's not awkward. I just feel feel bad because last time we did see each other, we were both sober. I mean, yeah, it's a thing for me, but I know that he's like kind of in between back and forth, kind of like I am. I'm not like super depressed to see him like that. I know we're going to both going to be fine. You, on the other hand. What? I'm just kidding. What? What are you looking for? I don't know. I already told you. I don't know. I know I have to do all of your job for you. I want to give him my number. And I want to call me and figure it out. Okay. And then given the circumstances, you know, like meet him in the lobby or something. I don't know. Whatever it is, I'll just give him the phone number. Okay. Oh, he says 20. All right. I didn't see 20. Listen, I probably have them just go through someone else. Okay. I just don't want to do too much. We've been doing the most. Yeah. And I'm really trying hard as much as I would love to help him out just because we know each other. I need to let him know I said that I would love to help him out. I've just had way too much traffic. I'm not going to tell him anything. And also, I just got. I'm not going to tell him that you're not going to tell him any of that because then you don't know what you're doing. Just be like, hey, talk to Becky. She says her condolences. Yeah. Like, yeah, she was selling a bunch of crack. Meanwhile, she was. Why would I say all that? I would shorten it up. Don't say any of that. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. You're like, yeah, go ahead and tell him that I'm, you know, been waiting all day. Like, I'm not going to tell him like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Don't tell him. Don't tell him anything. Just tell him. Tell him he better go somewhere else and I'd love to help him out. But not happening. Fuck you. Got to keep him guessing. No. All right. I'm going to put my this out on the deck until I. Yeah, I'll drive out and then I can fucking snap it. I have no idea what you're talking about. All right. Hey, figure it out.",

Am I visiting? Yeah. Yeah, I'm um... Well, yeah, I've got, I mean, it's just the adults around right now, but... Okay, I'm just over it. It's not nothing. I'm sorry, hold on, say it one more time. Um... I'm pretty over this whole situation. The guy has not called. Not nothing. He's texting, like he can answer my texts, but he won't answer my phone calls. So it's safe to assume that he jacked me? Well... Right? Right? It's safe. I don't know, you're... I thought so at first, but then it sounded like he would work something out with them, so I just, that's why I kind of stopped paying attention. No. He's just been giving me the runaround, and bullshit. And now I'm going to have to pay somebody to fucking go fuck them on. And I feel bad about that, but... Dude. Have you? Yeah. But according to whatever you talked about with him, you're not supposed to talk to a heifer. Is that what he told you? I mean, because... Right, like I pitched it up for him. That's stupid. Yeah. That's stupid. There's no reason why it's taken this long, and it's not bullsh... It's like... And you've been bullshitting me. Have you even seen him since we talked? No. He won't answer my phone calls since then. Since... He was supposed to come back with it. He has not answered my phone calls. He's messaged me, trying to assure me everything was going down still, and everything was right. I do know that last thing heifer told me was, he says, everybody's back to work on Monday. I don't know if that means anything to you. Yeah. I don't... No, it means nothing to me, because at the end of the day, I've gotten to run around this whole time. And it is so disrespectful to just not call me. I gave you $1,000. The least you could do is call me. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I was pissed. Yeah. But I don't really know him. I'm going to go back and look at my messages. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I don't know. I don't really know. I haven't talked to him. I was just assuming that you had worked everything out with him, and you were going to... I was going to call him over the phone for a minute. I mean, I guess it kind of implies that he's just not doing anything or he's blowing you off. But I think you were right when you said it right away. Although the things he said made sense and they lined up. Yeah. What you're saying is something probably didn't work out. So the money that he was going to go do something else with would probably flip it instead of giving it back to you. Yeah. Yeah. But who knows how that's going because he's keeping us in the dark about it. I mean, because that's like exactly what his fucking maneuver. What did he say? Only tell people what they need to know? I'm like, no. I don't think that's a good way to go. I think that when you run a business it's about being transparent and respectful with your coworkers and your employers. Yeah. Somebody told me yesterday. So I'm planning on getting the money back and it's the 10th. So I got to pick up dude at the airport and I'll have everything ready tonight. Sorry it took longer than expected to happen, but I do apologize. I was stressed out yesterday. But I mean, what what I say and what the guy steal your money. He said, thank you for keeping those details between us. And then he said, hey, can you talk to Brandon? He's talking to him again and now he thinks we're doing business. From before. You see him on the phone? I can't hear you. Not you. What? The remote's over there. Hold on a second. He says he's in Iowa right now. Yeah, and he said he can't answer like how can you text message, but you can't answer. If he's in Iowa and doing business with Ivan then talk to Ivan and confirm the details of his story and communicate with him because Ivan I fucking trust. I have like a fucking I trust that guy with obviously probably my life because I don't know my life. It's hard to trust somebody over the phone with your life, but obviously I risked a lot in the past for him and he's the man of your business. Yeah, it is. I mean, I don't like saying his name, but you know. I know I didn't. I don't know. I just said that out loud. It's fine. It's not. It's not. It's not like something. I was going to I was going to message. I was going to message him, but I just wanted to make sure I had the right person. Do it on WhatsApp. I'll give you his phone number on WhatsApp. Yeah, yeah. I'm going I got it now. I'm just going to do it on our group chat. He'll prefer I'll just give you the number because that way you can speak freely and he's not going to trip out because he's not going to tell you everything. He's not going to speak freely unless you're on WhatsApp. That's like a fucking stupid thing. Okay. All right. Here's his number and a text message, but you just got to go into the app. I personally think it's a huge pain in the ass, but I had to have some Middle Eastern dude come and like take my phone out of my hand and punch it in and because I don't know and he explained it to me. I'm just like, honestly, I feel like you got to be foreign in order to understand WhatsApp, but you got the number. Yeah. Thank you. You want me to hang out on the phone until you get it in there right or something? I don't know. Hold on. I got to figure out how to copy. I got it. I got it. You got your people there like all pissed off at you and shit. Stop at me. You got people like was that money yours or was that somebody else? Yeah. No, the money was mine, but I do have friends that are very upset if they if I don't you know what I mean? Because it's just a fucking it's a principle and I am going to have to pay somebody to fucking fuck them up. Like there's no reason this whole time this whole time you can't message me. You can't call me. You can't tell me what's up when you know how like fucking nervous and how like who just gives someone a thousand dollars? They don't even know nobody. So I'm a fucking idiot. So I mean, it's probably best that I do get robbed. I mean, I'm obviously not trying to make this worse for you or anything like that. I mean, I spent like the whole first couple of days and up until last night like ready to go do whatever I needed to do to get that guy's attention. I told you to go over there. I did. I was and I pretty much did. I was like yeah, but then I when those phone calls and our our conversations happen, like it kind of became apparent that you guys were talking with each other and you guys wanted me to work. He said between us that was like a clue for me to like I didn't even look at the messages. I just sent them right over to you. Yeah. And I appreciate you for being transparent with me. I mean, I know that I just feel like he is rather convincing guy. And when the way he talks and he's not bullshit. Yeah. I mean, I know I know him telling me to fucking not talk to my fucking good friend. Like that's fucking extremely backwards like I mean, he's like he doesn't want his business fucked up. Yeah, which is like basically what is what that's what Ivan doesn't want. It's them fucking like doing all this shit on the side and taking people off I mean if I find out that like he ripped you off aka me off because that's what I told him like me and you are the same. If I tell him that then he's going to be pissed. Actually, I don't really know how he reacts because he's not like anybody's dad and the car show don't have power up here. Yeah, they just don't they just don't have power. It's not like they have fucking like house fulls of people like we do. Right. But we're being like I'd be anyways if you let me know what you want to do obviously I would yeah I haven't fully agreed with everything but I yeah Are you messaging because I feel like that's your best solution at this period that's what the plan is communicate with him and tell him that you've been like really open and kind of hold a fast one on you and because I told you because here's the thing like I when they don't drop off the money. Yeah, they don't drop off the money without giving the fucking stuff. Yeah, there's no exchange of money without without a problem. So there's there's no fucking excuse that he dropped off my money and is waiting this time. Yeah, not a fucking idiot. So I mean if you work it out with him because you want to you ultimately want to do business with with half a time is I mean I would like to but I don't know if now is the best. All right. Yeah, whatever you want to do. I mean but yeah, I mean if you know, you know what it was like for me. I mean I the price I was fucking amazing up until I assume things just change but hold on. Let me call you back. I got a phone call. All right.",

I guess I was saying, like, I know you got that negativity and a lot of kind of feeling like it's unfair. And it is kind of, yeah, a little of this, a little of that. I mean, I see that your strategy is to stay positive and to continue to try to do good things. And that is the right thing. But I want to encourage you to, you know, also, you know, try to ask for help or whatever it is. I don't know if that's the right answer, but I just know that I'm here for you. And I want to see you successful. And I'm not. Yeah, I don't know. I just understand what it's like to be in your position. I'm also the black sheep in my family. If you didn't couldn't tell. Yeah. Yeah. I mean. Yeah. I mean, but the truth of it is, like, I don't know. I'm really I'm really not as bad as as it seems like. I don't know. Sometimes. I don't know. I thought you were cool. So. Yeah, I know. I am cool. So that's fine. I don't know. And I've always like I've always like, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Seth is pretty cool. I'm not saying anything about Seth, but I don't know. I just see you as kind of like the one that, like, they have eyes on. And, you know, not, not always do you know, like, what you're supposed to do to kind of please everyone and kind of just be content at the same time. But I want to encourage this thing with the shirt. Like, honestly, bro. Oh, my God. My kids. It's like, like, it's getting late. And my kids still have all this fucking energy and they're spinning around in the living room. Definitely cute, though. It is cute. Like, it's just I'm waiting for one of them to get hurt. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That won't be cute. I know. And like, I don't I don't I don't mean like, yeah, it's like, I feel like this is a bad thing. But like, you know, some parents, like when your kid gets hurt, you know, some of them are like, oh, baby, are you OK? And like, and yeah, I try to do that. But like, at the same time, for some reason, you got to toughen them up because, you know what I mean? You got to tell them that they're good because they are. I mean, I get I get pissed. Like, I remember I fell down the stairs once when I was a kid. My mom got my mom fucking yelled at me. I was like, I didn't totally understand. But yeah, I don't know. It's like I get scared or something. Yeah, I remember mom used to. Mom would like, yeah. The kids, if we were like messing around and we got hurt that way, mom would just yell at us and stuff. Which is kind of, you know what I mean? Cause and effect. Yeah. So I was going to ask you, like, so what is your what is your process so far? And like, what have you accomplished? Like, what have you learned that you're good at? And this whole, you know, clothing thing so far? Making clothes. I don't know. I really don't know. Like break it down. Like, so I mean, have you you've gotten good with, like, the printer? Like, you know, like, what kind of. Yeah, the printers. The printer is real easy. The printer is real easy. I've gotten good with, like, pressing the vinyl on there and making it clean. But it's all kind of just very easy. And I've gotten. I don't know. It's just a little bit of a process. Cutting out the vinyl, then weeding it. It's just kind of time consuming more than art or not, you know. But. I am kind of like. I am kind of curious what you mean by that. Marketing and stuff. So, like, it's just it just takes a lot of time. I don't know. So, like, are you are you, like, cutting these vinyl things out by hand or like, are you designing them like. No, no. I design it. Then the cricket machine prints it and whatnot. And then or it cuts it. And then I just weed it out because it's like a cut and there's still that negative part that's on the. OK. Dude, I know what you're talking about. Nobody told me this right away, but there's trance. It's called transfer paper. It's basically like. And actually, you can even use a painter's tape. Painter's tape works, too. But it's like because, like, I fucking I didn't really understand it either because nobody told me. I didn't have the patience to watch those videos. But like when. So when the printer gets done printing. You know, you print. And actually, I think you can put the transfer paper on there before. I remember. Right. But anyways. So once it's done printing, like you peel the transfer paper off and it peels that negative side off all at once. So you don't have to, like, you know, fucking get all the little by hand, you know, because it was doing that. It's like. I'm going to go see. That's been something you've been struggling with. It's like, oh, shit, this sucks. Yeah, that takes a lot of time. Yeah. Yeah. It takes a lot of time. Yeah, man. So that's once I knew that because I first designed it. You have to. But I mean, I mean, transfer paper. Don't you have to have like. Don't you have to. Get the ink in the machine for it, because it's like a. It's like paint that they put on, except, you know what I'm saying? It's like screen printing. So no. So this is my understanding of like how when you have a multicolored design and this is the kind of the. Is it so like. I have a vendor that I'm going to be going through. It's just these. I like whenever I make my prototypes or whatnot. That's not going to go to the vendor. The only reason why I just haven't gone to the vendors because they're. In. Cloud and. Also. You got to. I also. Have to like when I have to go there and two. I'm waiting till I can get my dad's tax number or. I might just get the owner of which doctor. The money for the shirts. They could get wholesale, but if I get my dad's tax number. And I could just get wholesale myself. Do it here. I'll get it. I can register your business and your EIN number is free. I don't know what the cost money is registering. It costs a hundred dollars to register. So by. I whip up like a hundred dollars. Yeah. Yeah. A hundred bucks and I can have you fully registered and. And have your EIN. And. 25 Minutes. That'd be golden because I looked. In 25 minutes. Yeah. Yes. I looked. I looked. To see the pricing and all that stuff. And like. It said like 200 to get registered and it could take one business day. If I pay extra. And then there was like all this other add on stuff. I know. Yeah, that's because. That's because of the skill that I learned. Yeah. I don't know. Also. And I'll show you how to do it. I mean, if you're interested. But I'll tell you like the first. First, like. Third, first, three or four times. I even had a business ID. A business license. I didn't know how to do it. I had somebody else set it up for me. But then I eventually. I got out of it. For a little while. And I got back in. I wanted to. Just set it up myself. And it took me. I was on that fucking computer website. For probably 10 hours straight. Before I fucking finally figured it out. 10 hours straight. She. Yeah. I was determined. It's about how long I'd take. Yeah. You know anything about like. Websites and whatnot. Like. Absolutely do. Absolutely. I can do that. Actually. Yeah. Cause I've been leading the website. What? Yeah, dude. I can do all that shit. I can. I mean, here's the one thing that I'm not that great at.

    "transcript": "Hello. Hey, good morning. This is Brandon. Yes. How you doing? Oh, who is this? Brandon is I'm calling for Jeff. Yeah, this is Jeff. So, I was actually just kind of going through my contacts. I see that. I just had a note that I'm supposed to give you a call, but I can be honest. I can't really remember. If you remember meeting with me recently, or if it was. Anything ringing a bell? Maybe did you come by Archangels recently? Yeah, I was at Archangels a couple of times. What's up? Oh, I was just reaching out. I think actually, maybe you're, you were supposed to, you and I were supposed to meet and I was supposed to do some onboarding with you. So you were CPRS services CPRS. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. What do you come meet me in person? Or how does that work? I kind of whatever it kind of works for you, I guess if you're if you're mobile and you're available, and then we can come down to the office where it's kind of. So, but if you're, yeah, or I can come to you, it's no, no, no problem. Yeah, I'm not really mobile. I take the bus really. Okay, I just got a job. So that's why I'm asking. That's also why I'm asking because today I have to be to work by 4, 4 o'clock and I got to get on the bus around, like, 233 o'clock. All right, and on top of that, I have to because I'm on ISR and I have to contact ISR and let them know about a meeting. So, if anything, it would be easiest for you to come to the house. So, you know, you'd be able to come to the house anytime because I wouldn't have to put in a smart sheet that I'm that I have to go anywhere. I got you. Where and where is the. Is it like 1 of the homes that group homes at the, like, the agent puts you in. No, it's a sober house next step. Okay. The address is 9236 Avenue. So, say cloud. So, what's the last initial for you. Okay. All right. Um, and then you said you you work today at four, but you have to get on the bus about two o'clock just to make it there. Yeah. All right. So, I know here's what I got on my schedule. Usually I have an appointment and that goes for from about now until about 11 or 12. And I can, I can, I can meet you after that. And I can come to you and maybe bring you back to the office and and kind of just get you enrolled because there's a little bit of a process that. We got to do to register you for services. And I can introduce myself to your parole officer as well. It's pretty common. Just so that they know I'm not like, one of the guys supposed to be revoid and. Yeah, no, I can send them a smart sheet. You said so you'd be here on 12. Yeah, yeah. I mean, if that works for you. Yeah, I can, I can send them a smart sheet and let them know and tell them that I that I'm meeting with you. They'll give me a phone call though. Well, they, they probably won't give me a phone call, but I'll just, you know, it's pretty much sending them a message and I give them your name. And tell them you're with CPRS and then if they have a problem with it, they give me a phone call. If not, I can just go. So, when I get off the phone with you after this, I can go on there and do that. Okay. So, just to make things easier also, like, I'll give you a text message right after I hang up, and it'll be like my first and last initial and just something that kind of help you save my contact. They'll want your first and last name and then the address of the office. Okay. That's, that's how they do it. They, they like, they don't, they like to know the first and last name because they, you know, they look the person up and check in and, you know, so. Yeah, I can do that. Are you okay with if I send you my contact card, I can say something that's a link that you click and it'll actually pop all that information up all at once. Yeah, that works. Okay. All right. I'll do that. And then I've got, I got you down for 12 this afternoon, and I'll give you a call maybe a little bit before that, just to make sure that things are still good. Yep. All right. Good. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Thank you. Yeah.",

So some night this week, are you available to be with you for that event? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And I also have to add to that.

About three or four minutes ago, uh, Heidi messages, like, the group chat and says, uh, for any of the St. Cloud peers, uh, they're going around. Uh, I'd recommend staying away from 33rd and... and 3rd Street because ICE is over there and they're... they've got the whole road blocked off. Yeah. Um, and, uh, actually I looked at... I looked at... Hold on. I actually looked at, uh, that location and 33rd and 3rd Street are not... Whatever, I might be getting the streets, like, fucked up, but, um... Uh, that's, like, right... It looks like that's right where, uh, that fucking group home is that, um, that fucking Dagan was working on. Oh, no. Yeah. Uh, so, are you able to read this? Are you reading it now? Sorry. I had to clock back in for my lunch. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, yeah, that looks like that was it. Yeah. So what is this. So is it basically saying, Oh, because I didn't, I didn't do my job thing in the same day. It's 20 hour minimum requirement. I'm actually pretty certain that I didn't meet my 20 hour minimum requirement. So what are they fucking talking about. Yeah, but maybe like the week before I don't know what a week before was week before was a holiday. Yeah, I don't know I would call a supervisor and it's like, hey, like I understand you know this part of it but like the 20 hours like I feel like I done that. And then what you're not complying with your directions to adhere to defines. Yeah, I guess you're gonna have to fucking read what your role is. Are you going out of your role. What does that even mean fully comply with supervisionary direction and adhere to the defined scope and responsibilities of the peer recovery specialist role. So I think that there's certain things you can and can't do and you may be doing things you can't be doing. That is what that sounds like. Okay. And if this is the first one you're ever signing like whatever I guess it's just a warning and then it's like, if you fail to fucking fix it, there's additional written warnings or termination. Okay. So tired. I'm sorry. Yeah. So I'm gonna get out of that. You know where you're going. Yeah. Well actually. Yeah, I got a place I'm going is. I don't know I have to look up the fucking times to make sure that I'm going to get back to you in time but basically I'm going to Minneapolis to turn in the thing in person. Yeah. So, say again, three, four. Get off in like three hours. About a little less. Justin. I mean, I was gonna ask Justin he had a charger. You want me to stop by and give you a charger or something. Leave in St. Cloud. Oh, yeah, I guess. At that point though you're just I said at that point though you're just wasting gas I don't know, like already sent this fucking thing through I get that you want to go turn it in in person but I feel like they're just going to take it from you and be like, Hey, you have a phone charger. You have a phone charger. iPhone. Get the cube. All right. From one. No, an iPhone for. That's okay. I could have filled this out. So how far away are you. There you are. I guess you're driving by you might as well drop off my, my charger. Yeah, so I guess this is where I says right now. For some reason I thought it was different than what I just looked up. Yeah. So that is like soda. I'm gonna have to buy a charger. Why, how much, how much is your charger. Not like my phone's on 4%. Okay, well I'm. How far are you. I just said you look up, look up where I was at. So, if I'm in St. Cloud you're in Monticello right. Yeah, I think I'm like 15 minutes away from here maybe 20 minutes tops. Yes, that's 24 minutes.

What can I help you with? Um, see, so I guess, um, um, I guess I was just trying to get, uh, are you the program, uh, program coordinator? Well, it depends on what you mean by program coordinator. What are you looking for? Well, I was, I'm, uh, a certified peer recovery specialist, uh, with Generation Hope. You're, uh, I know you're familiar with us. Uh, we're in the area. Um, and I think we were just trying to kind of, um, actually I'm, I'm not really sure now that I, I kind of just learned that, uh, you guys have already kind of been talking with one of my associates. So I should actually probably talk to her before, um, you know, going any further, talking to me or setting up any meetings or anything. So okay. Yeah. I'll give you a call back. I just need to make, okay. Yeah, no, that's no problem. All right. But ultimately we're just trying to help and see how we could do if there was any services that we could provide over there for any of the clients, um, that sort of thing. I think that's where I'm getting at. Right. Right. Um, are they in treatment? Uh, well, we work with people that are like if they're, if they have, so I'm sorry. So like if you guys have homeless, uh, people that are coming through and they're looking for substance abuse, uh, you know, services like, uh, you know, trying to get into treatment or just help with, I mean, that's stuff that we can help with. We're not, we're not LADCs or anything like that, but you know, we can help kind of manage people, get them, you know, reinforce good recovery habits. So, um, yeah, we've worked with CPRS before. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, um, I'm actually, I just didn't want to miss your call. So, but if I can give you a call back when I'm back in the office, I'm probably way better. Yeah, no problem. Anytime you want, have any questions or you want to call back, just call, leave a message if I don't answer and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. All right. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem, Brandon. Have a great rest of your day. You too. Bye.",

So I don't mean to sound like the world's biggest helper or anything like that, but I'm supposed to be going to get the kids, right? Yes. Okay. I just wanted to kind of confirm that. Yeah. Yeah. Because you, like you said, you didn't want to sit around and like, I'm sure you're tired and it'd probably be smarter for you to grab our kids than to wait for me to get off work for Maria to watch our kids when she could just pick me up. But when you get there, can you flip, put her sheets in the dryer? Yes, I can do that. All right. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Talk to you soon. Don't, don't do anything. What does that mean? Like, well, you could do it in the car, I guess, but like air out the car, obviously. And then don't do it in the house. Cause what if Maria knows? Right. I will make it. Yeah. I won't do it in any area that anybody's going to be interested in or something. I got you. Yeah. Maria is not dumb when it comes to it. Roger that. All right. Goodbye. Bye.",

It was a I Don't know if it's loud enough that it like I Don't know I don't want to say that it sounded like it struck me but it like I Don't know whatever it was But like I'm pretty sure I can touch me in my core. I Don't know it's honestly very similar to how you that thing with the window break with you. Yeah Like it's a loud shatter yeah, I mean this thing sounded like a like basically, I don't know like a fucking Aerosol can or something like that explode in probably 40 feet away But I just pulled into like the Dealership Empty lots to kind of look around and put in the kids car seats Okay. Well, that's good. That scared me. Yeah, it's scared Oh, um, all right. Well, I'm almost off Maria's almost here. Yeah Mm-hmm Okay, cool. Did you already get the groceries or no?

No, no And it's late enough in my shift I don't think my boss is just gonna randomly come by Maybe I should okay. I'll um, I actually Alright, well, I'm just about to pull up. Okay. I'll uh, I am still a little concerned that there's something that happened just now I don't know what the hell it could have been though because it sounded like it came from like like Not the car. I'll just look into it Because I sent her both of the assessments and she wants to like sit down and talk about like what our next steps are basically I don't know read the message or maybe she'll try to talk to you right now I Don't know I Don't know I Don't know I Mm-hmm Okay, so the so the the next steps of the assessment like so now that we have the assessments we're supposed to contact like CSS Fucking company and Yeah Yeah. Yeah, we could talk about it later I'm just saying that she messaged us saying that so I don't know if she's there. She might try to ask you about a time but that's on my whiteboard that like cuz when Atlas's assessment went through like my insurance called me and my insurance was like hey Like I'm the autism like fucking I help you with resources So, I don't know if they provide what we need or if we still have to go through the count Like I don't know.

I just thought I'd give you a call because it kind of occurred to me that I kind of, I mean even though of course we all agreed to it, I kind of left you out there. Awesome. Yeah, is everything okay? Anything? Yeah, we just moved the whole time. I mean did Kiana talk to the kids for a long time after we got back? I can't, hold on, let me put my other headphone on, I can't really hear. Say it again, sorry about that. Kiana talked to the kids for a long time and then like, you know, whatever, they went to bed and then basically I thought I was just chilling. I just thought I could talk the whole time. Yeah. That's good. What's up? Tell me what's going on. I don't know. I don't know. I just got in trouble at work today and I don't know what for you. Me? Huh? What? What'd you say? You asked me what's up, right? Yeah, what's up? Yeah, I just said I got in trouble at work today but I don't know what for you. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It'll be okay. Were you a pianist? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I was. Yeah, actually I think I kind of might know what it is about because like, I don't know, the other day, actually I think there was like two days in a row this week that there was a circumstance where I like let the client drive my car. Oh, no. And what? No. No, nobody got hurt. It's just that somebody must have found out. Yeah, somebody found out. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That sucks. What's that mean? Are you going to work tomorrow? I can't. Well, I'm pretty sure that I planned to off the top of my head. I can't remember what my schedule looks like but yeah, I don't know. I do know I got stuff. Yeah, that's right. I have like therapy tomorrow and I do have stuff. Yeah, whatever it is on my schedule. Yeah. Things like, I don't know, we had a lot of fun last night, actually. Did you have fun? I feel like I wouldn't say that. I mean, I don't know. Well, I guess tell me more about how you feel like that, I guess, if you would like. Like everybody just sort of went home with fucking free, you know, pushing an issue. They were trying to get the other thing though, right? Yeah, I think, yeah, they tried to call or whatever. But like my buddy was like literally like right on. I wouldn't hold on to that or anything because yeah, it's just kind of like, I mean, yeah, it's not great. It would have been better if it was the other thing because I don't know the other thing doesn't like last all day long in the next day. Yeah, but I wouldn't sweat it. It's just like I wouldn't continue to like let it be a thing. I feel like all of us are kind of contingent on each other, like supporting each other to make good decisions. Yeah, no, I guess that's what I'm saying. Well, that's a good thing though, right? Where you feel like you can't help us make good decisions. Is that what you're saying, Corey? I'm just saying like, you know, my decision making affects other people. That's all. I know. Well, mine too. And I feel like I've probably done far more damage than you have. I just, whatever. I'm not going to sit here and talk about it. It's over. I should throw it all away, but I haven't. Well, I mean, I suppose, and the reason why I didn't like say like, yes, you should was because, I mean, there's probably, I don't know, that's basically how much, however much it is, you could throw it away. Yeah. But I don't know what your finances look like. Right. I don't know. That's a terrible thing to say. Yeah, you should throw it away. Yeah. I wish I could get rid of it. I mean, that's what I was, this is my first thought was, like, I could have you give it to somebody and they can get rid of it and give you money for it, you know? Yeah. Oh, yeah. I remember you said that you were supposed to be getting picked up out of there. Were you like, do you want me to kind of try to get you a ride out of there? I don't know. Tell me if there's anything I can do to make things better down there for your whatever. Oh, I'm good, dude. Keanu gave me a ride home. Oh, you're home. Okay. I didn't know that. I went home earlier. That's good. Dude, I was too high to do anything, so. What time did you get dropped off? Like one, something. Okay. She gave me a haircut, which was really cool. She gave you a haircut on your way home? No. Okay. You know where I'm at. No, I'm sorry. I can't really say it again. I said you know where I'm at. Yeah, you're at home. No. I was trying to tattoo myself. By what? I've been trying to tattoo my legs, dude. Oh, wow. I don't know, because I got this freaking tattoo gun and it's brand new and I've had it for a while and I haven't used it. How many of them? How many clean, sterile things do you got? Oh, I got probably like eight outlines and then probably like eight or nine shavings, I guess. Yeah. I suppose if they don't last forever, you got to throw them away after every use, every time you use them. Yeah, pretty much. I think they're super cheap to buy, but I haven't bought them at all. You know what I mean? I got a few phone calls to make and try to figure out what's up. Oh, wait, you want me to give you a call? Yeah, I'll let you know about somebody grabbing that from you and something. I'll talk to you soon.",

I don't know, well, actually, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that. I was messing with you that time. Is there anything, like, where did you last see him? His mom, I believe. No, no, no, no, we were walking outside for like six hours. You were walking on what? We were walking outside for like six hours. It was cold as fuck. My paws were cold as shit. Why were you doing that, for fun? No, it was not fun. It was cold. Were you guys, like, broken down or something? I'm sorry, could you just tell me more of a story? No, it was stupid. I told them we shouldn't have left, but whatever, nobody wants to listen to Kathy ever. No, just like how I told fucking Vic that his fucking truckies were possibly locked in his fucking truck, right? Oh my god, what do you know? They were. Yeah. Because Kathy's not fucking stupid or anything. So. Everyone seems to think that I am, so. Whatever. By the last time you guys were walking on the side of the road like all night, and then, and then how do you guys get off of the road? Well, he went somewhere. I don't know where the fuck he went to. But he was not about to have it or deal with it or anything like that. So. And what do you think? Could you expand on that last? Could you expand on that last part a little bit? No, no, no, no. Where did you see him doing last that you guys didn't want any part of? I think he went into, like, an abandoned building. Okay. Okay. You know. You don't know. Apparently he had court this morning, not to. Or this afternoon. No, I think he has a court on the 15th, doesn't he? Man, I don't know. I don't have tabs on him anymore. They don't what? I don't have tabs on him anymore. Right. Would you know, do you know where this event, this property was, if you saw him at last? Broadway. South of Broadway. Okay. And so you are just kind of wondering if he's still there or if anybody. No, he's at his mom's. But his mom told me he had court today. Well, it's possible. It's possible that he may have gotten picked up by his new CPR. So I don't like, wait, but today's Saturday. No, no, it's not Monday. Yeah. Today's definitely not Monday. Definitely Monday, dude. Yeah. I don't know why I thought that. I think it was because he said Zach told me that he was supposed to be meeting with it or talking with the CPR on Saturday. I don't know. He told you Saturday that he was meeting with him on Monday. Right. Yeah. I'm so scatterbrained right now. I see. If I'm being honest, like, I got it. I got in trouble today at work, but I still don't know, like, 100%. For what? I am pretty sure I know what it is. But, I don't know. Dummy? Huh? Dummy? Yeah. Why? Well, there was like two days. There was like two days. The cream. Okay. We're going to check on gravy and just get the stuff for me. Yeah. Okay. Love you. Love you. Bye-bye. All right. Sorry. Okay. You said that you are pretty sure that you know what it is or something? Yeah. I was letting somebody drive my vehicle. Oh. Drive, like, two different people, two days in a row. Okay. What two different people? Well, one of my newer clients, and then I drove with somebody else's client. Are we going? Yeah. Okay. Two of your new clients? Yeah. I know, because that's how other people. Yeah. No, and I get that. Well, no, remember how I told you. Remember how I told you a while back? Okay. I'm just going to get in the car, I guess, by myself. Whatever. Jim, so. I don't know what to think. You are thinking, I suppose. If you're okay with that. I. I don't know. I'm all wrong. Anyway that I've been thinking. Which is. Probably. I don't know. Somewhat right. Maybe. What am I supposed to know? All I know is that I'm not supposed to be upset about anything. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. You know, I. This is video today. About this topic. And. It's really interesting because I don't know. I'm still kind of trying to put my mind around it. But it says something like. I can't. I'm trying to begin. But it sounds a lot like what. God, no, I sound like a fucking idiot. I don't know. It can be frustrating. If you're around somebody that is like you're. You're like opposite. Then. I don't know. It can be like kind of a really difficult thing. But it's also like a very late. Like positive potent thing. I don't know. I don't know. I listen to the whole thing, but. Are you still there? Yeah. Is your new person. Yeah. No. That's why I asked you for our number. The other day, because I was supposed to meet with her. I thought on Tuesday. At like noon or one or something. I don't know what happened. She was going to call me. But didn't call me. Yeah. Somebody clicking on right. Right quick. Give me a call back. Yeah. Ever decide to get in the car. I'm sorry. I'm okay. Hello. Hey, are you here? Huh? Yeah. Who are you talking to? Yeah, you. Oh, and Rick's here. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Cool. I was just telling Maria about that. I was like, you haven't met Ricky yet. Yeah, we're pulling up right now. We're just about to pass the. What is it called? Movie theater. Oh, okay. All right. All right. So. What's. I'll put the groceries. Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah.",

Yeah, dude, like, I, you know, like, cause it's like my feelings, like, we're out, we're out of, like, silver and shit. Yeah.

It's like, dude, I gotta get like, leave, leave a little me behind here before I go. Yeah. You want to make sense? You want to leave a, like a legacy? I don't. Oh, shit. I'm just going to just go up there in front street for everybody all the time. Should I do it like that? Like are you thinking like jump off a building or something? No, I'm talking about having a kid, bro. Oh gosh. Yeah. Yeah. You should. I think you should have a kid. Yeah. That'd be awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I don't do like, even if I like don't kill myself, I don't like the way my health is do like maybe 50 food or that, that's like taking care of myself. So like, I, I just, I don't have, I could be wrong, but I don't know what the fuck's up, bro. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you know, the pressure of having a kid can be like, like really, That's okay. The point is, is like, cause if I do die, I left something behind, you know, at least something. Right. Yeah. I mean, but if then you have like the pressure on you, like that, if, like if I wasn't perfect or if I could have done better than, you know, my kid's gonna, you know, that's going to be my legacy. Is my kids going to think I was a fucking like a deadbeat or something. I mean, it's kind of a double-edged sword and I don't know, you go from like having like, like the good old days where, you know, females were the only thing that could break your heart. Now, now you have like kids that could break your heart and it was just, you know, it's weird. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I'm kind of getting, getting to like, I had this dream, I had this dream probably like, I don't even know. It was probably like six or seven years ago that, um, that like the, my girls, like we're all older and I was older and we weren't talking to each other and it was because they like something had happened and I don't know what, but they had like really hurt my feelings. And because of that, I didn't talk to them anymore. Really? Yeah. That's cool. I wasn't in it? No, no, you weren't. I wasn't in it? No, I didn't say anything about you being in it, but my girlfriend was in it at the time. Yeah. Yeah, I remember. I don't know. I had a dream because when we walked into Kiana's house the other day, you know, it was like a dream, like this nightmare I had all the time and it had nothing to do with like, it was like that apartment building, like that apartment building, but then my dream was like, it was a bunch of black people in there. So it won't be down there, right? No, there is a bunch of black people around there, so yeah, Kiana's kind of getting on my last nerve, like where I'm going to kind of flip out on her, I think, but that's not like going to be helpful. I don't know, because like, the reason why the girls are there is because, you know, they kept on smoking weed out here and I was like thinking about sending them to treatment, but then Kiana's like, hey, well, I mean, maybe we can explore other alternatives before we do treatment and like see if they can come and live here. And I was like, okay, you know, I guess I'd be okay with that. I didn't want to like, fucking be like, hell no, I got the rights, bitch. I mean, because that's just be counter, you know, co-parenting. Oh shit, I have like three minutes. I have like three minutes left and I got to get into a therapy. Are you doing therapy anymore? No, not at all, no. Why not? I don't know. I really don't like doing it. It's like, I don't have no problem talking about whatever the fuck, but it annoys me because like, then they like start to date. Like, it's like, I don't want to do this. Like, I just feel like I have to like perform how they like want me to tell my own story to them, you know what I mean? It gets so annoying. Like, I don't want to go in there and talk about all the negative things. I just, I don't want to do it. I get super annoyed by it, so I don't do it. I can see all that being upsetting for you. Oh, but anyways. I don't know. I think if I, like, what? What? You know what I keep thinking, bro? What? That, because like, you know how ice is all here in Chateau? There's so many, like, foreign kids in here. Like. Yeah. They might be kicking the doors in here. We're going to be here looking like a mess. That's not good. Nah, I ain't got nothing. I ain't got nothing. Yeah, dude. When I had, I got a notification yesterday that ice was like in St. Cloud and they were had like roadblocks on like, like 7th and 33rd. And I was like, oh my gosh. I was just going through there. But, you know. Yeah, I was, me and Gavin were talking about like the whole you and Kiana thing. And she's like, yeah, I don't know. I guess I'd be. I think it'd be good just because you guys both kind of deserve it. You guys are both good people. She's definitely a good girlfriend. You know, that night. This is a pretty genuine. Yeah. But, you know. Yeah, honestly, like, I fucking couldn't have asked for like a better baby mama. She's very down to earth and. Yeah. But at the same time, she's sensitive and sensitive to a fucking like to a. Small shit. Like all the small things. Well, I mean, I don't know. Like she. I don't know her behavior. I don't know. Yeah, she's just like, if you don't, if you're not like appreciative or if you're not like, you know, you're not as sensitive or you don't like apologize or something like that. Like, you can like get. Oh, yeah. I'm like, I get like that. It took about five years, but I finally snapped all for not doing. So I got to call you back. I can call you back in, like, probably a little over an hour. All right. All right. I'll talk to you soon. All right. All right.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Hello. How's it going? It's fine. I'm sorry I didn't call you back, but I feel like that Hex was a little bit reaching. Huh? I said I'm sorry I didn't call you back, but I feel like you saying that I don't value co-parenting with you is a little bit reaching in this situation. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I was so fucking sick yesterday, and it took all I had to drive up there, and then I had to come back and work, and then I came home and literally went straight to bed. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Weird. I did this. I managed to do the same exact thing, and still had a pretty decent interest in, I don't know, kids and communicating with you, but I don't know. Oh, my goodness. Okay. No, I agree with you. That was kind of a taxing day yesterday. Fucking really terrible. Yeah. Actually, I don't know why you're... Never doing that again. Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's definitely not a thing. Definitely not making that a thing. What? Definitely not making that a thing. Making it a thing? What do you mean? Like doing that often? Right. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. That was a fucking weird night, but... Yeah. It kind of sounded like... I mean, I had fun for a little bit of that. Yeah. No, I had fun, too. It was just a weird night. In general, just I never would... If you would have told me that's what was going to happen my Sunday night, I would not have expected that. Yeah. I don't know when the idea came up to bring Corey on a field trip. I was like... Mm-hmm. Like, what better person to bring somebody on a field trip? Because I don't know. He was the same the other day. Like, I don't know. He was feeling pretty lonely. And he was up front about that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so I don't know. I feel bad for him. Well, I don't feel bad. Yeah, I mean, we had a good time. We hung out and just talked and stuff. Yeah, I know. Fucking lame as that, dude. What? Me and Gabby would call you the next day and we're like, how big is this dick? Does it have hair? And you're like, I don't know. We just talked. Which I kind of figured would be a possibility. Like, either one of you or both of you may take a gentleman's stance or some stupid shit. What? The gentleman's stance? Yeah. Oh, like, I don't fuck on the first love at first sight. Whatever. I've always had a crush on Corey. I've always thought he's cute. And I just don't jump into bed the first time I hang out with somebody. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm sure it's not the first time I hang out with somebody. Usually. I mean, I would have, but no. I'm just kidding. Well, I mean, you should understand that under certain circumstances, that it's okay. Yeah. Anyways. Yeah. Well, thank you for bringing him home. I know that there was a lot of driving, extra driving that I had to do for the whole encounter. But... Yeah. I like this. Yeah. It's all good. It was good to hang out with somebody too. I get fucking lonely over here as well. Hmm? You're lonely? I said, it was nice hanging out with somebody too. I get lonely out here as well, I said. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Yeah. He was saying, dude, I get it on the phone with him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And a few weeks later, I called him today, and he's like, yeah, I want a kid. I was like... Like... Yeah. So, yeah. And I was like, you know. I talked to him about that, but... What? Yeah. So I talked to him about that for a while. About what? Him wanting a kid? Yeah. Hmm. I want a kid. Yeah. Yeah. Me too. This with Corey? But I was... I don't know. I was encouraging him. I was like, well, yeah, maybe you could. But also keep in mind that, like, you know, if you... Like, having a kid becomes, like, an incredibly large emotional responsibility and physical responsibility. Which is obvious, I guess. But I guess when you have... When you're, like, pre-parenthood... I guess when you're, like... When you're, like, pre-parenthood, you don't really fully anticipate that. I don't know. Girls... Girls, like, are going... I don't know. Something besides girls is going to be... It's going to affect you so emotionally. Like, now you got kids that are, like, you know, kind of tug at your heartstrings. Yeah. But, anyways. About those kids... Did he say... Did you ask him about hanging out with me? I don't know. Yeah, he told me that, basically, when you got back, like, the girls were all... I mean, like, all pissy. So you sat out there and you talked with them and had a discussion. And he said that it took for, like, kind of a... You were out there with them for a while. So you didn't really have much of the night to, like, I don't know, jump into things, I guess. Or whatever you want to call that. Didn't have much time to hang out, is what I meant to say. Yeah. Yeah, I had to deal with that when I got home. Yeah. Where did you go? They said that you left. I got to you. What do you mean to me? You guys weren't... You guys, when you pulled into the parking... When you were in the apartment areas, like, I seen that you didn't come straight to the house. You went, like, around. And I was like, what the fuck are these guys doing, like? Oh. I didn't even know that happened. I was so out of it, dude. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I was, like, way... I don't know. Yeah, the whole conflict with the girls, like, yeah, it could have... I don't know. I don't know. I just fucking... Something has to be done, I guess. But... Yeah, I could have, like, probably used my words a little bit better towards the end, where I, like... Like, I didn't even raise my voice, but I feel like I was assertive when I said it. And obviously... I understand that to somebody that hasn't experienced a lot of trauma, like, basically going to the grocery store is going to be traumatic. Yeah. It's true. It's true. I mean, like... It's just things impact everybody differently. And just because somebody hasn't experienced, like, that same amount doesn't mean, like, the things they have haven't been traumatic to them, you know? Yeah. I mean, I guess, in that case, like, it'd be, like, some sort of mutual respect, I think. Yeah, that's how it should be. Yeah. Thanks. I don't know, I just fucking... The girls have been just, like, incredibly disrespectful to us, and I get that they're going through, like, this period. Uh-huh. And, uh, yeah. I see you're in a fucking position as well. Like, you, uh, don't... Like, you enjoy having the girls back, but yet you're afraid to, like, set significant boundaries that are working, I guess. Yeah. Yeah, that's fair to say. I just, uh... It's hard, like... Having it all... I don't even know how to say it, like, because it sounds bad when I say it out loud, but, like... Just, like, I don't have... Like, when they are down here, like, I don't have any help, so, like, it all falls on me. Like, there's nobody else here to kind of, like, help take the, like, some of the weight sometimes, you know what I mean? And so, yeah, it gets to be a lot, and sometimes it's, like, I don't know how to handle things correctly. I just am doing the best I can. Hello?",

When I threw up a little girl and I laid down, we used to go out and come pick up the kids from school. We're like shit right now. Yeah, so they did go to school. They didn't go to school. I got notifications that they didn't. They're at school. Like there was a walkout today at the high school. And so I'm thinking that they might have went on like the walk with that for a little bit or something. They don't ever have their phones on. They're not supposed to be on them. So I can't like talk to anybody. I picked up Ava from the high school, though, today at lunch because everybody left. Everybody left? Like the high school kids did a walkout protest in response to the ICE stuff that's been going on. And Ava didn't go. She was in the counseling office and called. So they all just come get you. Huh. Yeah. But I'm on my way to pick up Hello Nash right now. Yeah. And you're going to work after that. Yeah. Yes, sir. Living the dream. Living the dream. Yeah. What? What do you mean what? You called me. You're like, you have no idea how disrespectful you're being. So I was calling you back. Jesus. I don't have anything to talk about. So I can let you go. I'll talk to you later. Okay. How am I doing shitty, Brandon? I'm actually kind of expecting you to, like, communicate with me and problem solve and do all this. You're not. I mean, I have to fucking threaten you to fucking get you to call me. And you act like you fucking like I'm not right. The last thing I want is another fucking Donna. And this is kind of what it's seeming like to be. Maybe you can second rephrase a little bit how you want to have this conversation. Well, I'll think about it. I got a call.

    "transcript": "Um, not too much, kind of trying to make my day a little bit better, and it's been kind of bad. Oh yeah? Trying to be, trying to turn it around. Oh, well, I don't know if I'm going to make it any better. Because I'm super confused as to why you feel disrespected, or why you feel any of that way at all. That really fucking pisses me off that you would even say that or feel that way. I don't know, I don't know, it's just confusing for me, I'm just so confused. Confusing? I literally gave it to him, because I believed, I believed, right, because you didn't answer the phone. But I believed you that this was all real, and that this was a real guy, and all this shit was going to go down, and it's, I've got nothing but the runaround. And for a second, you know, all I kept telling myself when I was going to give it to him was, oh no, Brandon's sore up and down, he's a stand-up guy, he would not do something like this. Like, otherwise I would have never trusted some stranger with a thousand dollars, I would have never trusted anybody like that. I don't, I don't think you would have trusted me with like a thousand dollars. I don't trust anybody with it, like at all, but the fact is like that you literally said like this was going to go down, and I, and the price that you said it was going to be, I could not, I could not fucking not do it. I couldn't fucking pass it up. It was too good to be true. And I knew it was too good to be true, and I should have fucking, I should have listened to my instincts, and I should have fucking did that, because it was too good to be true. I don't know. I mean, I see that as kind of a little pessimistic, but I mean, I trusted you enough that, I mean, I brought it all up to you, and I know that this is a, it is a, like a good opportunity. It has been for me, but I know that it'd be like way, way better benefits for you since you are more actively like active. And I, I obviously like, I don't know, I don't fucking condone him being a douchebag, and I can't say anything to that that's going to defend that, but it's, you do understand like that, I never would have, like, whether he was like anybody, I mean, think of it like this, like, you wouldn't have given me that money. I mean, that's like, just not safe. I would have given it to you if I would have believed that you were going to follow through. It's just like, it's. And I would have trusted, and I would have trusted you with that, knowing that. Well, I like to hear that. That sounds good. I feel like. I trusted you enough to know that, that's what I'm saying. I put my trust in you, and I believed you. That's the only reason why I gave it to him, because you said he was the real deal. I never told you to do that. So the, no, you didn't tell me to do that, but I did it because I trusted that it was going to happen. It was going to happen that you said it was real deal. So the fact that you feel disrespected and you feel some type of way over it. Well, it's not. That's not the part. It's hurting me. That's not the part. Yeah, I guess I feel disrespected because when I tried to resolve it, like the way that I felt it was going to get it resolved, like you kind of, you basically did tell me to step out. Like, you've got to cover. I did not. I did not. I did not do that at all. At this point in time, I don't care what, what you got to do, like tell, tell fricking Jose, Cuervo, whatever the heck you want to call him. Have you talked to him at all? No. Why not? Like, why, why aren't you doing that? That's not the best. I tried. He's not talking to me. He won't talk to me. And the other one just keeps giving me the runaround and keep saying tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. I don't even care anymore. I want it now or I want his truck. I have no problem going to his house. I'm literally going to, I'm going to pay somebody. That's how bad, that's how pissed off I am. I'm going to pay someone to take care of it. Well, if you do do that, you can't talk about it. You can't tell people that that's what you're going to do. You can't send text messages. Right. You're going to do it. Well, that's just where I'm at, but I'm at work now, so I'm going to have to let you go.",

Like, I don't know, when that roofing contractor shit starts in a little bit, dude, that's gonna be fuckin' baller. Yeah. Yeah. As far as, like, weather, you mean? Yeah. Yeah. I do what now? I feel ya, I feel ya. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you think so? I don't think so. I mean, it's just, like, who's got fuckin' five grand to fuckin' spend on that shit? I mean, like, it's... I don't know, I think, like, businesses, they start out with, like, a little bit of money and then they just, like, you know, they keep that money, like, flowin'. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what I'd do, like, what I'd do if I just... froze up inside of me. I can't. I've never been like this before. I can't, like, come up with a plan and, like, push me. I just sit here and just procrastinate. I've never procrastinated this long. I don't even procrastinate, I just lay down and sit and sit. Yeah, I mean, you should maybe consider getting on some medication. I don't know. Like, I know that I am. When I come down off that shit and when I'm not on my medication, dude, things are not good. No. Dude, I've had, like... Why do I answer people's phone calls lately? Why do I answer people's phone calls lately? Why do I answer people's phone calls lately? I haven't even said all of it, but... why do I answer people's phone calls lately? That's some bullshit. Dude, it's weird, dude. I've had, like, two people say that to me, bro. Do I look suicidal?

No, I'm just pretty much hanging out. Not too much. Good. I just left from being with my sister and Doug. My sister went out of town somewhere. Okay. Yeah, I haven't gotten a call back from her either. Yeah. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I mentioned your name. Actually, I don't know. I don't think she did. She actually hit me up today saying that she's still out that money. And I was like, I don't know what you want me to do. But. All right. I was going to see you. I talked to you yesterday, right? I don't know. I can't remember. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did. Yeah, that's what I thought. You were telling me about how Zach, you guys were with Zach outside in the cold and like. Oh, no. Yeah, we had been there for him. That was the day before. Oh, okay. Yeah. I don't know. He like broke into some place and like. That was like vacant or something. Is that. You said he did. Yeah. I mean, that was a question, I guess. That's kind of the way Cassie described it. He like seen a place that looked like he could get into. No, he knew a place where he could sit and be warm where he comes out at. Yeah. What was it? It wasn't like a house or something. A building. Yeah. Like on Broadway. I assume that he's probably still there or something. No, he's there. Hold on, stop. You said she talked to him. I tried to call him before I made it here. Oh, he's at his mom's. Yeah. Okay. Okay. He didn't call me back yet either. Okay. All right. I just wanted to make sure he was. Yeah. Like back there or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it kind of pissed me off. Like my boss switched me. He told me that he didn't want me working in Minneapolis anymore. Because I can say cloud is like, God. Like, we don't have like any CPRS is out there. I'm like, right. But it kind of makes me just want to like, kind of like Zach. Like, I want him to fucking like, stay out there. Or at least stay out there until I can get him into a place. Or maybe do the same thing with you guys. I don't know. That's kind of up to you. I can't just kidnap you. But with Zach, I am kidnapping him. I made him be open-minded to it. So, yeah. Packed his bag that day. Yeah. Because in Minneapolis, it's hard. Talk about me and y'all conversation. No. You asked Chakara, how long did it take her to get like through all that paperwork? What'd you say? How long did it take you to get through all that paperwork? No, you were still talking to me. What'd you say? Be said, how long did it take you to get through all that paperwork? You said what? Yeah, we are with Aga. Yeah. Like, from the shelter to? She said, depends on what you're talking about. From the shelter to here or from the streets to here? I don't know. I was just told to apply. Like, have Zach apply to Aga. I don't know how. When did they do the paperwork for her? Oh, he said he was told to have Zach apply to Aga. And he wondered, did they do the paperwork for you? Zach already applied to Aga. He was already supposed to go there. He was already supposed to go there? Okay. All right. Yeah, he was supposed to stay in contact with them. Like, they're supposed to be in touch with them now. God damn. Some of the people at Aga. Okay. All right. All right. And what about you guys? Have you guys talked to Aga? The time that I damn near. I don't know, Cassie. After I moved into the shelter, I ended up with an Aga worker. And it took them all the way until basically when I moved out for me to get a good ass worker. So I was on the program. I was on the program, like, finding a house longer than where I was supposed to. I should have been in a property. I should have been on that motherfucking program for six months finding a house. It should have taken no longer than three months. So it took about six months to get into a place. Because I had two bullshit ass workers before the workers lady I had. And she said she had two bullshit workers before the one she had? No. Okay. But technically, it takes almost up to three months for them to find housing. Yeah. He had got a call for housing, too. So when we was in Lakeland. First of all, Streets to Housing, they're trying to get ahold of Zach. It is also part of the program because they can put Zach in a shelter and he can move quicker. She don't move quicker for him. What's the other one? The one that he was going to do. The other one. Streets to Housing. Nope, not that one. It's over to the east. I don't know. But there was another one that was trying to get ahold of him. It was probably my phone for him. I don't even know Streets to Housing. Yeah, I thought there was no Streets to Housing people that called your phone. Yeah. But I know that because I answered a couple of them. Coordinated Entry. Yeah, that one. That one. Yeah. Well, that's part of like agony and all that. Because you go through Coordinated Entry to get into certain programs or to get into a shelter or to get into some of the shit. So Coordinated Entry. Yeah, I had Coordinated Entry, but I bypassed that shit. I had to quit. Shut the hell up. I don't even know where it is right now. Hold on. It's over there. Guys, don't be busting in my shit. I could be in here doing something. You ain't doing nothing. All right. We ain't doing nothing. Yeah, I agree. One day we're going to be doing something. You know what? I'll do it. You say please and thank you. I ain't never talked to her or nothing. I ain't never talked to her or nothing. I'm just tired of having to face it. So. Yeah, I just texted you some stuff on your Facebook account. I went through Streets to Housing first to get into the shelter. She said she went through the same programming pretty much. Streets to Housing first, and then from there they put me in Coordinated Entry to kind of keep me into the shelter and to get me into a housing program, which is Aggie. You get that? Yeah. And then from Aggie, like I said, I ended up getting a good worker, and she got me in here. One thing about Aggie is if you work with Aggie, Aggie will help you pay your rent anywhere from six months to two years. And supposedly by the time you exit their program or they're done helping you pay your rent, they're supposed to have you transferred over to something else to make sure that you can keep your rent going. So you can sustain your living. Okay. So. But like they help you, they have a worker that helps you find your home, they'll give you rides to your viewing and shit like that, they'll pay your application fee, all that shit. Okay. Okay, all right. Okay, I'm gonna probably get ahold of fuckin' Because he goes to Aggie, he can go through Hennepin County and Hennepin County will pay his damage deposit in his first month's rent. In full. That's when he secures a lease. Me? I haven't been able to get ahold of Mary. Because I have relocation funds from when I got out of my house. All right. You gonna take me over to VUC? Yeah, man. I'm gonna get ahold of Mary. All right. I'll talk to you guys later. Okay. But Arthur, he's in a working, I'll help him if he doesn't want to do stuff.",

    "transcript": "Other calls: Miles Niska @ 6m 14s Hey, good morning. Really, how you doing? I'm doing good. I'm on my way into the office now you're good man. I apologize for not getting back to you yesterday. I kind of got carried away in the meeting and some stuff outside of work so I just never had a chance to call it crashed once I got home. Totally totally OK. It was, it was like the last thing, you know, towards the end of the day so I get totally good. Now how you doing though what's going on? I'm doing good. I had a chance to go to these two different homeless shelters in the St. Cloud area and kind of checked them out and but then I don't know after I talked to my lead out there Heidi and she suggested that, you know, basically anybody that is there would already have come to the, you know, the Archangels building out there anyway. Which shelter did you go to? The place is called Place of Hope. Right. And, I don't know, when I talked to one of their staff, you know, I asked him, I was like, you know, if there was anything that you guys needed here what do you think it would be that would help you guys be able to improve your service? And they said that, you know, that we really like to see, you know, people in here offering resources to people and, you know, recovery services and stuff like that and, you know, they seem to, they said that they feel pretty overwhelmed like it's like pretty bleak there I guess. So which one was this? Was this Place of Hope? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK. And what was the other place? Yeah. And the other place, well, the other homeless shelter was Lincoln. Was it Lincoln? Yeah. The Lincoln Center. I talked to Scarlett over there. Yeah. What are your thoughts? I mean, obviously, I want to move some peers up here and there to work with some of the folks, but since it's a low barrier, I'm not sure how that's going to work. Yeah. I was, I don't really know what that expression means, but. Are you saying like, so here's my thing, right? Let's say, for example, we set up assessments and we want to follow up with those folks that are supposedly, according to Heidi, it's hard to get in touch with those, with some of the folks that you're trying to get assessments for, like kind of getting all of them because it's a low barrier. People are easier with apps there. I'm not sure. That's just the context I got. I haven't been there, so I don't know. I don't have a personal experience there. But I mean, what do you, what's your thoughts on it? Well, I don't know, actually, I feel like you're probably right, actually. And when Heidi said that to me last night, it kind of made me like adjust my thoughts about like, you know, maybe pursuing some of that stuff, but I'm not, I'm not sure. But I did get a call back or an email back from that Annie Thompson from Recovering Hope and more of, and she said that we should talk to her boss, her name is Sadie, and that Sadie would be open to meeting and doing like a virtual visit with us, with me or you or whatever. I don't know. I was just under, on the understanding if we are talking about like some sort of working together. Right. I'm just trying to figure out how that would work well for two reasons specifically. One is I know for a fact that they already have peers there, right? Yes. And then secondly, kind of like, so obviously we'd focus on getting that continuum of care so that once the folks get out of treatment, they can continue to work with a peer through us. Yeah. So I would want to do work on that. And then secondly, also, I mean, one peer there would be fine. I mean, you already live in Moore, correct me if I'm wrong. Yeah, that's right. So that would be a good fit. It would make things really nice. When's the last time I spoke with Sadie? Let me see. Let me check. One second. Okay, so she emailed me earlier this month. Who's the president? Please let me know when you may be available to meet in the next couple of weeks. Okay. Let me reach out to her, see what she is thinking, and then I'll get back to you on the recovering hope side of things. And then also on the place of hope, when it comes to place of hope, I would like to have a peer there. But here's my thing. They say that they already kind of forward our stuff to Archangels. Yeah. So Archangels, are there a lot of assessments that are in a lot of folks that need peer recovery services? Yeah. Yeah. There are a lot of walk-ins. Yeah, definitely. That's what kind of made me rethink my thoughts, because my initial thoughts were kind of very hopeful of working within there somehow. But then when Heidi kind of said that, you know, they already come here already, it would make sense that, yeah, maybe the people that are serious about pursuing recovery, you know, walk down the road to where we are. Is that how far is Archangels from place of hope? It's, I'm going to say probably like a mile or less or something like that. And then how about Lincoln House? That's actually kind of on the other side of town a little bit. Yeah, that's a little bit where it's... Okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Do you have contact information for the folks at Place of Hope? Yes, I do. And also, I don't know, I don't know if this is like a personal side note, but the person that... That was my supervisor calling me. Could I actually give you a call back? Okay, go ahead. Yeah, just give me a ring. All right. Thank you. All right. Bye. Hello, this is Brandon. Hey, Brandon. How are you doing? I'm doing great. I'm doing well. I'm on my way in. Okay. Yeah. I was just on the phone with Mahad. Okay. And what was that about? Let's see. Well, I... Let's see. So I was talking to him. Well, I mentioned the Place of Hope, like wanting to get more people, like have some more recovery resources offered there. And before I like went into it, I just mentioned that into a text message to him yesterday. But I wanted to talk to Heidi first, what her thoughts were. And she was like, you know, basically the people that are there, if they want recovery, you know, they come here anyways. And I was like, yeah, I guess I see that. So I see it kind of being like, we're already kind of doing that already. And then I also mentioned that Annie had gotten back to me, the counselor, and that she said that we should talk to Sadie about, you know, that sort of stuff. And then Mahad looked it up, and he says that he had actually already been in communication with Sadie. So he's gonna follow up with her and see how that, and he's gonna get back to me on how those conversations kind of work out. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. How are you doing? I'm all right. I'm trying to get over this head cold. Yeah, so, you know, I haven't been getting much sleep in or whatever. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah, me too. It sucks, but it happens usually only once a year. So thankfully, I don't smoke cigarettes or vape or anything. So it's not like, it's not unbearable. You know, I don't got a lot of phlegm coming up. Yeah. And I'm a healthy person. You know, I drink a lot of water. I get 10,000 steps a day. I work out five times a week. You know, I am very blessed to be overall very healthy, you know. But okay, yeah. So one of the reasons why I'm calling was just to see how you were doing, see how your week was going, and see how I can help you. Yeah. Well, I seen obviously in my email, I was written up. Yeah. There was a couple of points in there I was a little confused about. But either way, I don't know. I'm not really sure. I mean, I don't know. I thought like with, I was pretty close to my hours. I think with my hours and then the admin time, I did actually get over 20 hours, but. Yeah, no, I know. I get that. And I, you know, as far as that goes, I apologize and or know that like, it's not me. It's my me being told what to do. Like as far as writing people up and, or like being more strict or stringent with things. Now that it's like a new year and or that there is a new system that the state is making mandatory where like 10% of all appointments have to be audited. And then like, there's this system where you get like a certain amount. Of basically like, you know, I don't know. It's just crazy, man. Every everything is changing. Our system is changing. The state's expectations are changing, but that also our company is changing. You know, Lacey next week, she's going to be the program manager and who to won't be there anymore. So, you know, things like I said, are just super different right now, to be honest with you. I didn't even read what Lacey wrote or generated for me for that writeup because I wasn't there for that. She has been helping me with that again, because I have the majority of the people and so she's been kind of doing good his job. So because she's going to be doing it like for real all by herself starting on Monday. So we're all, I guess, trying to get on what would be considered the same page and or that was the reason why I called this morning was because she was on the phone with Heidi and one of them was asking about you, what you're up to, how you were doing it, et cetera. So just being as transparent as I can in communicating that some of this is, I don't even know what's going on. I'm just playing messenger, if that makes sense. I haven't checked to see where you're at with your hours. I know that I for a fact had asked her to consider the fact that you were like, you know, right within that, that range. But I said that pushback by saying that ASAC was clear about anybody like capital letters. Anybody who didn't make their 20 hours would have to be written up. You know, definitely don't want that to discourage you. And I definitely sent or told her that sentiment. So, you know, like there's people that have kind of shown that they don't care or will not put forth effort and you are not one of those people. So I don't want that to, you know, be an issue moving forward. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of what I was. Yeah. Spoken really well, actually. That's kind of what I was thinking to myself. Like at first I was like, I was actually like really pissed, but but then I was like, you know, I don't know. I don't, I really don't want to walk away from this. Like I, I don't know. I don't want to walk away from you and like, and I would definitely like in a professional level, like I would really enjoy this to be like a positive, positive experience. And yeah, absolutely. And I'm, I think that yeah, I'm not going to let it, I mean, it's not saying like I I've broken any laws or anything. So, I mean, a lot of the things are a little disputable, but at the end of the day, like I could, if it sent me acknowledging I could improve, I could always improve. So I am going to continue to do my best. And honestly, like there's a lot of people out there that just need the help. So, I mean, I, I can't walk away from that as like a big thing. Yeah. For sure. I mean, at the end of the day, like it is all like, everything is a life lesson and a learning lesson, you know? But I think the most important one is to not, not personalize, especially when it comes to our duties or our actions or our, you know, like, you know, our, our, our, our, you know, our, our, you know, like identity, if that makes sense, you know, like all we can do is keep trying our best in each day, whether or not that like is perfect or not is a different story, but I think that like learning to give ourselves grace and patience, you know, like through that process, because listen, man, we, nobody walks into this job knowing how to do it or how, you know, like there's not a lot of clarity. And so we learn as we go. I think the important part for you to know is that there is no ill will or animosity on anybody's end in our company, and that we are all actually there to help and support each other. And I understand that your particular situation is different because there's less onsite support or like, you know, you know, compared to the city where there are like more established connections, more established clients, you know, the, the admin teams here, et cetera, we could be meeting in person, blah, blah, blah. But, you know, you're making a very great effort and you're almost like a trailblazer. If you think about it, you know, like you're doing something that hasn't really been done or established yet in your area, you know, you know, so it's going to be not only an uphill battle, but there's going to be like some bumps along the road. You know, I think that we've shown as a company, our interest in you, as well as our support, you know, as well as like, again, back to that patience and grace and understanding, you know, like giving you the time off when you needed it. And then, you know, like we are invested in you and want to know that your time is valuable and that, you know, we still want to make that work. Like, I, I promise you there has not been like discussion of you quitting or resigning or asking you to do so, or whatever. There've been like five of those conversations over the last week with other people. So, yeah. I got you. But, you know, again, I understand that like the hours can be tricky. And I want to know, like, do you think you're going to be able to do that this, this week? Well, I, let's see. I didn't work yesterday because I had like some family stuff going on. The day before that, like the hours that I did put in, like, I didn't get my reports in right away. And that was the day that I got, I received that writeup. So because I, because I wasn't able to get my reports and like, I was actually, I tried to get my, my, my thing going, but I, that, that person read the right guy's name. Richard Kinney is under, Heidi's primary. Heidi is his primary. And she like took me off of the list. So I couldn't like add him to mine and I didn't like figure out how to, I don't even know if I I'm allowed to change, like who can provide care to him. But like I found the list and it's like three or four people and I'm not on that list. So I couldn't even like pull his name up to make a dap note on it. And in time before it became late. So I just like, yeah, I deleted it off of connect team. For future reference, like as far as that goes, I would rather you, number one, that's something that you would call me for as your supervisor to help you with, or to tell me that you had a problem. Number two, that I would rather you do the appointment and then explain to me that, Hey, he wasn't on my list. It was, you know, 11 PM at night. I didn't want to call you blah, blah, you know, like communicating almost is like takes the hard edge off of any blow, you know? Like if you were to, you know, have one situation like that a week, then that's like fine or perfectly normal. But I think that like when the majority of your notes are late, that's when it like looks crazy, you know, like this week there was five out of six notes that were late for you. Whereas there was 22 notes from somebody else that not a single one of them were late, you know? So when the list has that much of a disparity, it stands out that that makes sense. But like, was there a specific reason with this red person where he went from the being on your list to not being on your list or. Specific reason. I don't, I don't know. I have a, nobody's a, I have an idea, but Heidi hasn't really told me. Okay. Okay. I mean, I guess that, that, that's fair. If you don't know, then you don't know. But I mean, I know that I have a guest had met with him before and had charted. So at one point he was on your list, correct? Yeah. I have charted for him before. Yeah. Okay. Well, yeah. I mean, that is definitely like, you know, a question, Mark, how, how has it been going with the other clients in the area? So collect, I met with her a few times and, and then I was able to talk her into, well, yeah, she decided to go into treatment inpatient treatment. So I won't be meeting with her anymore. And then he said, yeah. Okay. So I'm supposed to be on board. I got to finish on boarding one, one other person. And I'm thinking I'm probably just going to pick him up and bring him to partners. And then I'm supposed to be onboarding one other person today. And let's see. No, I should have taken a picture of that. See, Chrissy Riley. I think I'm going to be meeting with her for the rest of the week, starting tomorrow morning and possibly into Saturday too. Okay. And also with yeah. So I know well enough not to like go down to Minneapolis and like work with him, but Cassie told, called me the other night and like kind of an, I don't know if you'd call it an emergency or whatever, but she, her and her and Zach and her boyfriend were like walking around out in the cold for like six hours, I guess. And Zach like broke into this. I don't actually, I think what I initially heard was he broke into some vacant place to keep warm, but then I, but then I, after I got clarification, I guess it wasn't that, I guess you just like went and cuddled up next to something warm. That was like some like business building or something like that. But I don't know at the time I was like, okay, that sounds like scary emergency. But I was like, you know, if it comes to that, like I'll, I'll make arrangements and I'll pick them up and bring them to a homeless shelter out here until I can get them into like a housing. Cause I know they got the two homeless shelters out here that accept dogs. And really? Yeah. That's crazy. I never heard of that. But that's really cool though. Yeah. But on top of that, I actually did after I doing some research last night, like I guess there are actually resources out there. Like who did had to sit down and like, egg it and whatever. I just like to see that guy not sleep outside. That's crazy. Okay. Well, in, in, in the follow-up about that, I guess he had a meet scheduled meet on Monday with the other CPRS will that he didn't show, show for or communicate differently. So I guess that's, that's, that's crazy. Yeah. So I know that we have, we have to try, I guess if he's like, I mean, I don't, I don't really know what to say as far as like, you know, his actions. I don't place any judgment on them just based on that. You know, like everybody's an adult and they have autonomy, you know, but like, I don't really know what to say as far as like, you know, his actions. Everybody's an adult and they have autonomy, you know? Yeah. But I would like to pretend, you know, I at least see if that relationship could or would work out, you know, based on like this person's availability and proximity, you know, like he's closer and has a free schedule. And that, especially if this, hold on a second, Poppy, you have a snack over there and you have water, you're clean. Daddy can't hold you all day. I have to finish making breakfast. I love you. You're a big girl. You got toys. You got a, you got a screen to watch right now. Yeah. Daddy gave you the computer so you can watch this Rachel. Hi friend. Here we go. Good job. Um, yeah, I want to be able to see if Zach, you know, would be willing or able to meet, you know, for that. Um, because obviously, you know, having somebody nearby or working with them, he wouldn't have found himself in that, that position the other night, you know? Um, so I don't know if he has his phone still, or if you can get ahold of him, or if you can, I guess, get back to me, you know, what, what his status is. Yeah. Yeah. But just so that then this one person isn't sitting around waiting or, you know what I mean? Cause there's like, like I said, like literally five people in the company that quit or fired that now I have to like reassign their caseload. Yeah. And, um, you know, we, yeah, you know, we just want to know who's, who's actively interested in receiving the services or not. Right. Right. Right. No pressure and no judgment, but just to figure out how we can help serve everybody, you know? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And I, I can imagine that probably his actions kind of appears like somebody that's not really pursuing it. Yeah. Um, you know, and I understand people will call usually only when they sometimes need it or have to, um, but even still then, like, I don't know. There just comes a point where we're not going to chase you or keep playing phone tag or whatever, you know, on you to come to us in or prove to us that you're serious. Like, yes, we'll make genuine attempts in the meantime, but like there has to be a point where we're just like, Hey, you know, you're, you're obviously still out there trying to figure it out on your own and that's okay. You know, but, um, you know, not letting it take up our mental or emotional bandwidth, you know, or energy is, I think the, the, the lesson to learn here in general, um, you know, because obviously like problematic clients continue to have problems and, or the more we become invested in that, then again, that we kind of attach our like personal or professional identity to that, you know? Yeah, definitely. Whereas like that could, if we gave it all of our energy, we just send this little circles for days or weeks or months. Totally agree. Totally agree. Yeah, definitely understand what you're saying. Meeting clients where they're at, where they're currently at, I think is like, again, one of the more important lessons, you know, we accept them. They're, you know, physical and mental condition, you know, and emotional status. And we can help them while we're there when we're there. But other than that, you know, like, again, we can't, we're not God. I mean, we can't control what another human being does, feels or thinks, you know? So. Right. Yeah, totally agree. Yeah. I can't, can't help him if he doesn't want to help himself. Yeah. Okay. But I did actually, because I know that I need to tell you the job scheduler thing. I wrote it. I wrote it down on my board at home. Because I know that I anticipated having to tell you what my plan was. Yeah, so I wrote down like all the hours. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of like my times of availability and because they kind of core. I also kind of have to coordinate with Gabby. I'm like, he needs to be picked up and dropped off at work and stuff. Okay. Yeah. What else? And I. Yeah. I wish I would have taken a picture of it, but. Yeah. Okay. Okay. And I think I'm going to try to. Cement those, the rest of those appointments today. So when I get home, I can tell you what. The rest of the week is going to look like and what next week's going to look like. Okay. Perfect. Yeah. And then just to clarify, like I said, Having your hours is more important than. Yeah. Don't don't not do an appointment or. Whatever. Does that make sense? Right. Yeah. Absolutely. Okay. Yeah. Cause even just like. Even meeting with a client and not documenting it and or billing for it is like. Technically unethical. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And. Document that. So just keep, keep that in mind too. That was like. Right. Underlaying. When. You know, that incident happened in the early morning or whatever, with the dog bite and everything. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. Absolutely. Um, I don't know. I don't know if this person. Completed a registration or not, but I had a. Like a personal friend. Who runs a sober house. She hit me up and. Shared my contact information with somebody. And I asked her where she was located. Right where the sober house is located. And she said it was. And located in Maplewood. And her name's Amanda. And. Yeah, I sent her like my contact links. Like that. I, that I share with people to give them my information. Yeah. And. I told her, you know, Follow my contact link and, you know, register for services. So I don't know if you could, if there's anybody in the office that. Is in the Maplewood area that could help her out. Um, I mean, Maplewood is just outside of St. Paul. So it's not far. I can definitely. Um, you know, find somebody. Um, yeah. Yeah. And also, I don't know. I've sent this, I created this link. It's kind of like a. A digital contact card. That like, um, I send to people, you click on it. And it shows a, I guess, saves my, my stuff into their phone. And it also gives them a chance to say, send their number to me. And I'm going to send it to you. Because it's kind of like. I've sent this to probably like. Like two dozen people. And then it just kind of occurred to me recently. I was like, man, I don't know if miles knows about me sending this to people. And I feel like I should probably. Just tell you that I'm sending it to people so that. Like, it doesn't sound weird or anything. But I'm going to send it to you. And. Kind of just get your approval. Okay. Yeah. There we go. There we go. This is what I send to people. I just sent it to you in a text. I should change it. Yeah. Yeah, I like that. I, um, I've never seen anything like this, but it's really. Professional. Yeah. I like that. It gives them like the signup sheet and then the question thing. Yeah. And it gives them a chance to download my number. Into their phone. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I used to use it on my, in my other business. But I just like updated it so that. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I love doing that because like, I am. Yeah. And it's like, I can also do it as a QR code, whatever. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Yep. Yep. I mean, there's nothing. You didn't lie. Right. Right. Okay. Like, like I said, I'm, I'm impressed. I would probably. Sit down and do something like that. Similar when, um, when I get a chance, so I'm inspired. And yeah, I mean, anything to make your job easier. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'll do some R and D report back. Yeah. No. And I also appreciate your, you know, asking for my opinion. Um, you know, I guess personally, probably. Whatever. I appreciate all that. So thank you. Okay. Let's see. So it was, um, Oh, I don't know. So you said that you didn't. You didn't read the. Um, So did you want to go over that? I mean, it sounds like we're already kind of pretty much dead. Like the. Yeah. Let me just. Yeah. While we're on the phone, let me open it up. Okay. Apparently I didn't even. I didn't even open it up to sign it. Okay. It looks like. In general. Describe three different things. The first was my, my hours. Uh, the second was. And the third one was failure to follow the directives. So. Maybe you can't have that. You can have the water though. Yeah. Water. Um, It was like a little confused about the third one, because I mean, I was trying to make sense out of what that could mean. And I'm like, does that imply? I was like working with. I don't know. I think it was, I, I, I think that was related to how long. It took to like. I think follow up at the Lincoln center is. As well as just, um, Showing up. Or helping out in St. Cloud. You know, I think there was like that period where you had gotten back. Um, but. It. In some ways, it's a blessing to have all those folded into one, because then there's not multiple of them, you know, um, there's definitely like. An option. Like, I guess, legally in the sense of like. Each one of those could have been, it could have been its own and or subsequent. Yeah. I think the reason why the last three were included in one was just to have. Those different issues. Formally. Addressed in the sense of like, now it's on paper and documented. Like again, it's not meant to. Um, You know, give you a one, two points. And it's also not meant to. Discourage your progress. Copy. Can you put that back, please? I love you. I love you. Um, so, I mean, I think. Again, so if that's. Kind of makes sense that it's almost like. Those ones were. Somewhat old. Or that one was somewhat old slash brewing in the background. But. I don't know if that's something that would be. Or that I would ever want to be like. A writeup on his own or of its own. If that makes sense. Yeah. Again, because I know that even just if it's. Pure psychological. Effect that getting. You know, a writeup one week and then a writeup the next week. Feels like you're doing something wrong. Right. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how to put it all out there and get it all out there. And then. You know, continue to move forward and grow. Like I said, that was. Irrelevant of the last week. And so that kind of like. Sucks that then you might correlate your recent. You know, Surgeon performance. Like, you know, getting close to that 20 hours or. You know, making these other. You know, you know, keeping up the right attitude and engagement. And, and, or that. The. Moral of all of those stories is just effort, you know, or initiative. Putting forth. And, you know, initiative with. You know, Pre-planning meetings helps. You know, planning where you say you're going to be. Or, you know, calling who you say you're going to call or. You know, again, like just getting your notes done. On time. You know, like. These are the things that. We expect of everybody, whether they're day one or. Brand new, you know? So. You know, Yeah. Is that bluey? Let me see your feet. There's something going on on a 94. Yeah. Yeah. Where. Like right where opportunity drive. The exit is like, I, it's on my GPS. It's like. Moving at a snail's pace. Like it just stopped basically. Oh. Opportunity driving. It's like, it's like a little bit past clear water. But I don't know. I guess ice has been up here. Like I was up here. I'm like Tuesday. Yeah. Monday and Tuesday. And they're like getting all crazy here. Yeah. No, for sure. Yeah. I mean, I'm sure they have a lot of Somali people up there. You know, I'm sure they probably have a big Mexican population too, but I know. You know, there's some. Yeah. That's crazy though. That whole stuff, man. I don't. Oh, dude. I don't. I didn't mean to call you. Yeah. There was some gentlemen in the office the other day that was dropped off by somebody. And he was in, he was in like, you know, I recognize them because he asked. Yeah. Came to me about wanting to get services set up. But then he told me that he had been sober for longer than a year. And I was like, I'm sorry if you've been anything. And so I offered to give him a ride home and blah, blah, blah. And he wasn't sure if he needed one, but he was in there. Like the topic came up about talking about ice and all that. And all these super racist. Comments started coming out and I was like, so flabbergasted. I couldn't believe that he was saying all this stuff in the office. I was like, oh my God, I'm sitting here thinking to myself, like, like. All like all of my bosses are middle Eastern. What would they think if they heard this conversation? I was like, I was so froze. I was like, I think I got up and walked out of the room. I didn't partake in that conversation at all. Wow. Yeah. I mean, you know, it happens, man. Listen, I got, I got a client that is. A white. White guy from like the Boston area. Who comes from money. And like, you know, like literally. Bro, I can't even make this up. He got a haircut. Like a couple of weeks ago because it was. And he like. Was proudly saying that he showed his barber. This specific picture of Adolf Hitler so that he can look like him. So anytime and every time he gets in the car, there's like. You know, crazy comments about politics and. Gender and race and. Religion and everything that I'm just like, you know, I have to take that. In, but at the same time, like. I don't know. Everybody is different. Right. And so. I hear you on that sentiment of like. There's a lot of discourse in the public. About. You know, specific races or cultures and. And or they're like immigration status or. You know, like the recent, like sensationalized fraud. You know, with. Some somewhat air quotes, but also there is like some legitimacy to it. You know, it just sucks that like. The other people have to deal with that. You know, there was. Yeah, but that, but at the same time, that doesn't change. My view of my bosses or my coworkers. I know that everything we do is. Ethical and within reason. And. Legitimate, you know, I've had nothing but. Positive interactions with. All the people around us, you know, like I highly respect a Zach. He's the person that. Trained me in, you know, and. Yeah, no, nobody could tell me anything otherwise, you know, so. I, I stick to my truth. You know, I live my truth. I do my job to the best of my ability. And, you know, I try to. Create positivity everywhere I go. So those are the things that I do know. And that I do that I can control, you know? Absolutely. Yeah. Yep. I just hope that. I mean, I never really, I don't really make the distinction between like. Somalian and Muslim and. Muslims of religion, religion. I understand that. But like. Our never asked this question, but our. Yeah. The people that we work with Somalian or, I mean, that's. Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. Yeah. It's an East African centric program. So like they. Are from that community and they want to help that community. You know? And. Yeah. But we're also not. Not limited to that. You know, like. All the Kairos people, including myself came over. They pretty much. Absorbed us. And or what we had going on into the fold. And so it no longer became just about them. Somalian community in South Minneapolis, but rather. You know, like now we're statewide. We have. Teams with experience out in. You know, all throughout the state, you know, Rochester, St. Cloud. Duluth. Et cetera. You know, other people in outlying areas like you. You know, Rob, who's out in. You know, et cetera, et cetera. You know, so. So we're, we're, we're about the people, man. We're about everybody and everybody. You know, like we, we, we have established onsite people at Catholic charities in Minneapolis, which is a homeless drop-in center. We've had a long-term partnership with. Missions detox out in Plymouth. You know, like we. We're not just like. A hole in the wall operation, you know? Yeah. Absolutely. We had a partnership at pride Institute working with, you know, the LGBTQ populations. You know, Like we, we, we have established onsite people at Catholic charities in Minneapolis, which is a homeless drop-in center. We've had a long-term partnership with. Missions detox out in. Plymouth, you know, like we. Yeah. We've had up to like 30 to 35 peers at a time. Give or take 500 active clients on our caseload. You know, so we're, again, we're not just like. A fly on the wall. You know, we are making an impact on. A large population of people that need it. And yeah, you know, Like it wouldn't matter to me if these people were, you know, As long as they, you know, are do what they say. And I'm talking about like our bosses and stuff, you know? And or support us. In our times of need, you know? So. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I just hope that they stay safe. Kind of sounds like. Kind of sounds like that. And, you know, I mean, yeah, I feel like. Or something gets, you know, Any people in our office. You know, getting manhandled or some crazy stuff. Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, the. The boss, the throttles. Yeah, no, I mean, yeah, everybody is pretty much. I mean, number one, we're all legal. And or like how our papers and, you know, all practice peace and or de-escalation, you know. So that that helps. You know, I think that having animosity and being combative is kind of like underlying themes of how and why that one woman was shot. Like, granted, that's never OK. But at the same time, like. If she were to have gone to and from work that day and or stayed home or did anything else, then she wouldn't be in that position. You know, like, yes, it's super fucked up that they're harassing people at the pumps at gas stations and or random citizens. And yes, that's super scary. Like, that's definitely like fascism in its, you know, early stages and or in being implemented. And yeah, like the idea of them being able to just come into our city and take over and fuck over shit and fuck shit up. I don't like any of that, man. I really don't, you know. And it is scary because we do have clients that don't have papers or clients who have family members who don't have papers. I mean, to be frankly honest with you, bro, I'm a first generation American. Like my mom and grandma are from Canada, you know. So like right now my mom's talking about like moving back home, like out of the country. So, you know, and my grandma was here for 80 years without papers, you know. So like, you know, putting myself in her shoes, that's pretty crazy. You know, I mean, I've actually been in a situation with the police officer where he did draw his gun and shot into the car and it grazed, a bullet grazed my head. But I was like trying to get away and not go back to prison, you know. So I absolutely empathize with that woman and her partner, you know, like having to be in that car crash and know that like your partner is dead and whatever, like that's definitely crazy. But, you know, again, like taking responsibility, I knew that that day if I hadn't been doing drugs on drugs and having drugs in my car, then I wouldn't have felt the need to potentially run a cop over just to get away, you know. So like I have to take responsibility for that part. So, yeah, I mean, I don't know. I'm actually going to probably have to let you go right now. I got a phone call. I will talk to you or check in with you later. Okay. Okay, that sounds good. Have a nice day. Yep, you too. Bye-bye. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Yeah. So you're using your mom's phone right now, right? Yeah. Okay. And I your phone is I can't get it charged. I plug it in. Google says the battery light turns on saying it's charging and it won't go to like that flashing number where flashes tell you that it's charging. I don't know if you know what I'm talking about. But they just immediately will turn off the plugged in battery symbol like because it'll flash when it's dead with the little red bar on the bottom of the battery. And then when you plug it in, it just has that battery connection charging symbol, the battery with lightning bolt in it, and that'll disappear. And then I'll immediately Google will pop up and like try to turn on and then it'll just power off in late so it doesn't actually turn on and it won't I don't have a charge enough. I don't have ability to send it enough charge fast enough for it to load up for it to not keep doing this. Whereas this is just keeps doing that. Yeah. You know, when you have a suppose you have like a wireless charger? No, I don't. I was actually thinking about getting one but I don't have one because my mom has an Apple Watch that she's wireless charger for no Apple Watch. I tried to take a brush to the inside charging port where it like doesn't sound like a good idea. I think you're supposed to like if you're gonna do anything, you probably have to like just use air air to clean it out but like duster but anyway, anyways, let's maybe we'll look at the phone in person but for the moment now understand so you can't really get logged into an email. I know and I my goal is to maybe if you could maybe put in a like a text now app on her phone if she's okay with that just temporarily for so you can call me and then I can call my supervisor because I need my supervisor's permission to come and get you in and essentially bring you out here so that I can like, you know, help you connect these dots because I guess like with your phone being a little messed up and hard to get a hold of you like I guess the guy there's your CPRS try to get a hold of you on like Saturday or Monday or some shit like that and he couldn't get a hold of you so they marked you is like I didn't show up. So my my proposal is I'm and I need my need my supervisor's permission because they basically told me to just work only out of St. Cloud if I can come and get you and bring you out to this way and I just need him to say that's okay and in order for that to happen it'd be best if you asked him does that make sense okay so text now and call me and then I'll make an arrangement to probably come and get you like as soon as I'm out of here actually so I'd be able to pick up Gabby at like four go back drop her off so it'd probably be like around like seven or some shit then I'd be out at your mom's. Okay. Sound all like reasonable. From and from there what? Come on I'll bring you out to St. Cloud and I'll make sure that they have a call right now as soon as and see if they have like a place if they do intake like what's their intake process like but I know that since you are like affiliated with a recovery organization you know aka me I know that they'll they'll put you in a room like right away but we do need to have a cage for your dog right and and with that how's that gonna go when I got warrants I don't think that they check for that are you sure I'll ask because because then I'm in a situation where I'm stuck with another impound fee for my dog and fucking shit you know you know I did find I did find this resource that's available in Minnesota part of Minneapolis that uh they'll they'll actually uh it's like daycare for your dog while you go to treatment if that sounds interesting to you at all treatment I don't know what treatment because it's not it's not anything that I'm there's nothing there that can teach me something new I'm like the educational factor of it where it would be like a situational experience that would have to occur for something to change where I don't have that ability to like acknowledge or even tolerate like people talking like oh I'm addicted so it's okay like I have such a resentment towards that statement in itself because if I do fall in that category there's never been I can never justify the means of it being okay to do some grandmanship because I was in my addiction and that process doesn't click at all I'm not saying that you should like drink the Kool-Aid or anything like that but reconsidered like the reason for doing those things is to get like the benefits that follow no and I get I I get that too where the stepping stone thing having to sit there underneath observation for fucking 45 or 90 I get all that where I'm so beyond that where I to my knowledge I have housing options open if I can get myself to a get or coordinated entry or yeah absolutely those are the same front door yeah and with with as far as I came along in that process my name should be like the top of the list just waiting for me to go in and acknowledge unless it unless there's some kind of expiration date because when the day that we had took my phone I was supposed to get a call later that afternoon for a place for Cassie and I to move into you know yeah that's right yeah I guess you missed your appointment and those are those are actually well I don't know I'm not sure it wouldn't take much to call those back and get them get you like back on like in their sites or whatever I guess because because it wasn't like my concern is like I I'm like out in the same cloud now and right I can I can only try to connect these dots over the phone but if you're here with me I can like like actively kind of pick you up and do these things too I don't know right that's where my worry is like you know having my phone all that shit because I guess if you don't like if you're not where you're supposed to be or you don't have a phone when they call or when whatever if you miss those appointments and you're fucked you're right and that's pretty much kind of what happened with with that and that was over a period of time I couldn't get anybody let me use their phone to make contacts and fucking by time that I hook up with Cassie in that evening it was in the evening so that was pretty much all summer last summer two summers ago now I was looking at like I was doing some more research because I heard you had to sleep outside like next to some fucking warm like something like the other night no what I did was is I found my way into this like it's a year around greenhouse type deal it's a wood structured fucking shell where there's like saran wrap over it and inside it's tinfoil and it's like a little yeah that sounds exciting dude your mom doing okay like she's smoking she's she's dying smoking a joint oh okay but is she also had pneumonia or is that just the joint that's doing the head that's COPD you have one of those masks that you wear that has like the oxygen mask whatever thing she's supposed to like it's not a mask but it's like a nasal yeah yeah and that's it's hard to come by I don't know like the whole the mass the treatment for COPD yeah yeah I guess it's a pain in the ass like to get him I know so I know somebody else that has that yeah she really uses it because it's so it's is that it's strenuous of a fucking task whatever you can't smoke you can't smoke that's a big factor I suppose that's be really stupid to light a cigarette with oxygen on oh your face yeah that the gas that they use when I got fucking the helium air balloons like the hot air balloons it's just air that's what I mean it's just oxygen air but they got a gas tank that's the I'm curious on what gas it is that the you is that they keep the care up with to keep the air balloon so to Zach yes what do you want what do you want to do do you want to my I would like to urge you to come out here and I could still like try to get you into all those programs down there but I highly suggest coming out here where I can see where you have a place in a room and a place for a dog yeah I guess I was waiting on that since the weekend last weekend or whatever all right all right I totally totally understood okay so can your mom's do you make phone calls from your mom's phone yeah okay all right then I'm gonna give you a phone number can it kind of like three-way column right now yeah that's what I'm saying actually you you call me from that from your mom's

I can have Brandon give you his number right now as well if for some reason you don't have it. But he was the one that was, you know, had the ability to meet with you, you know, regularly. I know that he like lives out in kind of your area. I mean, he also has like a pretty free schedule. So, if you could just, you know, give him a text back, if that's easier for you, and then you guys can go from there to set up a time to meet.

His name is Will. Will? Yep, Will. Okay. And my apologies for falling out of contact with my phone. It's okay. There's no worries. Yeah, no, it's all good, man. It significantly disrupted everything I had going on this week. For sure. It's definitely a setback. Yeah, yep. And so I know a little bit about your situation. And so I want to try to be able to help, you know, and I can help Will navigate through that, you know, with you and help get you back on track with your court and all that type of stuff. So, you know, you know, I appreciate you, you know, meeting with, you know, and communicating with Brandon. And he's always still there as a resource, you know, but just on like a day-to-day, you know, basis moving forward, you know, Will has the time and the ability to be there as much as you would need it, you know, to give you the support that you're looking for. That is something that I will totally have to utilize. With that being said, Brandon was, could I have Brandon come and pick me up to help me get some things with what he has available from helping with my phone to getting some of the stuff that we can do over the phone tonight? Yeah. Well, let me talk to Will. I'm going to do it. Since I didn't know his name before now, I'm going to actually reach out to Will and kind of try to like work together together because all of us working together would be better than just me.

Well, actually, I mean, honestly, I didn't know that guy's name. So, and since I know his name, like that changes everything. So now I can like, I know how to get ahold of him.

And she called me back and I turned it into a three-way call. And then that's like how that all got started. All right. But I got his phone number now. I'm going to call him right quick. Okay.

He has actually actively having some phone problems, but my name is Brandon and we've never met, but I recently had just transferred out to the same cloud office to work full-time out here instead of taking clients in both areas. And I believe you're one of the newer guys to the office. Is that right? Yep. Cool. Well, I don't know if we, it doesn't sound like Zach is part of the conversation, but it says that he's here. So maybe you can hear us. I don't know. Okay. I'll text you. And I think Zach is one of my main guys I was visiting and he's kind of got a lot going on and he could take a lot of your time, which he kind of does require some significant attention as much as you can get it anyways. So I was going to share whatever information I had with you and kind of get you as up to speed as possible so that we, cause he's been like staying outside, like looking for places, warm places to stay at night and crazy, just crazy shit. So if I can get your email or text it to me or something like that, I'll text you my information as well. And we can kind of chat more when you get a little bit of time. Yeah. I have some time this evening, a little later. Yeah. All right. Wonderful. Then I'll just plan to do that. Okay. All right. All right. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Thank you. Yep.",

So, is this for you, Brandon, or for a client? It's for a client. She's with me right now. Okay. So, I can only help with one of those per day. Okay. So, you need an ID to get a birth certificate. You need a birth certificate to get an ID. So, has she had a Minnesota ID prior? Yes, but not in the last 10 years. Yes, but not in the last 10 years. Okay. Has there been, does she have a current ID from a different state? No. Okay. We can go up to the DMV and have them print out something, but it wouldn't be an ID. It would be one of those temporary IDs. Last time it happened, I had to get a certified copy of my medical records and take that to Social Security. Did you hear her? Yep. Yep. So, before she comes to see me, she needs to check with the Stearns County Administrative Services Building to find out if she can get an ID, since it was 10 years ago, if she can get an ID, get, still get an ID, without a birth certificate. Yeah. That is an option. I can't quite hear her. We went through the whole process to get my ID, and then when it came to open it, they said that I needed a copy of my marriage license, since my name had changed or whatever. So, it's a whole thing. Okay, and you don't have a Social Security card either? No. Everything got took. Okay. And so I know you don't have a birth certificate. What state were you born in? I was born in Minnesota. Okay. Do you have a relationship with a parent who could get a birth certificate for you on your behalf? Unfortunately, I don't. My mom is, I have actually, I have, I'm her guardian, so she's not able to do that. Okay, does she have an ID? Possibly. I don't know, she hasn't. That's a great question. What is your, what is your name? Janelle McCarter. So Janelle, if we would want to backdoor this and make it the easiest, if your mom has a valid ID, it has to be valid. Right. You can fill out the form for your birth certificate, and she, because they need a copy of a valid ID, and as your parent, she can request it for you. Okay. And you can do this by mail, fill out the form. You can still come to me, it's $26, so you still can come to me. I'll write out a check. Sure. You'll fill out an application form. We can make a copy of your mom's valid ID, and we can send it, and they're going to send you a birth certificate in six to eight weeks. Okay? Yes. That's how long it takes. My grandma just passed, and she would know if mom has an ID or not, but she's, she's, you know, in a nursing home, so I don't know that she does have one, but I. Okay, well, okay, that's something you have to check out. That's one, that's one way. That is good. You can also, you can also go to the St. John's County Administrative Service Building and ask them that you had an ID 10 years ago, what do you need, and they will tell you. Okay. And I will help, I will absolutely help pay for that, but you gotta, I gotta know how much to write the check out for, so you gotta get that figured out with them. Okay. If you, if you have a social security card's gone also, right? Yep, everything. Okay. Know your social security number when you get there, bring a medical, if you have a medical bill, bring that. Okay. And it'll be all the better if it has your current address on it. Right. Are you, are you currently housed or are you experiencing homelessness? I am experiencing homelessness, I'm at shelter right now. Okay. Well, so, if you get an ID, the idea of an ID is to have an address on there. Right. And are you at Place of Hope, Salvation Army? Yeah, I'm at Place of Hope. I use my son's address for my, you know, government mail or whatever, so. Okay, because that's where they're going to deliver this ID. Yeah, that'd be fine. Okay. Yeah, and for your birth certificate if you run into trouble, ask them, does your son have a valid ID? Yeah. Ask them if your son can request your birth certificate, if your mother doesn't work. Right. I know a mother will work, but you kind of got to, but if you get an ID first and they go, yeah, even though it was 10 years ago, we'll issue you an ID with medical records, get the ID first. Okay. Because then that'll make the birth certificate easier, okay? Okay. I've said a lot, I hope, hopefully Brandon has heard that also, so. You are extremely helpful. I really appreciate it. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hey Amanda, this is Brandon, how are you doing? Hey Brandon, how are you? I'm okay, so I was leaving the office and I wanted to give you a call. Yeah, so how are you doing today? I'm alright. I, yeah, just in the midst of trying to keep a rough over my head, so you know how it goes. Well, maybe you don't, but it's a little stressful, you know. Yeah, I actually, I've totally been there and it's, but I've got your back 100%. I wanted to get you kind of, so Koku kind of told you a little bit about what I do, and you're familiar with CPRS's? Yep. Oh, okay, perfect. Have you ever had one before? Say that one more time? No, so have you had, you've had one before or recently? Um, no, so really, like, so I'm like about to be a year sober, I'm in recovery, and when I was going through treatment, I utilized this CPRS's. Well, I am in treatment, I go one day a week, but um, so I've had one before, but I haven't, like, initially, like, signed up for one, which is good, because I've been looking, you know, to doing that, to have that extra support, so that would be perfect. Yeah, well, it's definitely a good thing that you reached out now, because when's your sobriety date? January 2nd. So, you're just over a year sober? Yeah. Why, does that disqualify me? It does, it does, but I think, um, we can do nine months. Yeah, I mean, I can't, I can't, uh, yeah, well, here, so here's what, legally, I can't tell you to break through, or to lie on an application, but that's what, just so you know, it's a year, and if you put something different, that would be good, to get you services. Okay, got it, yep. All right, but, um, so that link I sent you, um, it was kind of like, um, I don't know, it was, like, you click on it, it pops up in my face, and all that, blah, blah, blah. Yeah, on that link, I don't know if you still have access to it. I was gonna walk you through registering it. Okay, one second. Okay, I'm on it now. Okay, so when you scroll down a little bit, um, one of the first links, I think it says something like, um, I don't know, apply, or form, or services, or register for services, whatever. Mm-hmm, well, it says, it has your picture, it says call, message, mail, add a contact, exchange contact, um, I see an email, registration form, that one, original assessment. Yeah, yeah, so basically, so there's, on this thing, there's that registration form, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna walk you through that, and then after that, then we're gonna come back to this area, and then you got to click on that, uh, that next one, that, that assessment thing, and that, and that's, yeah, I mean, basically, I'll be on the phone with you for probably 10 or 15 minutes, if you got that. No, that's fine, I'd rather get it done, I'm definitely not complaining. Okay, all right, cool, so yeah, go ahead and click on that, and then, um, first thing, yeah, so I was instructed to have you click Miles, the one that, so find the name that says Miles Niska, and, okay, yeah, and then I go on to the next page or whatever, and go ahead and answer those questions the best you can. Yeah, I was actually gonna ask you about that, so since you said you just got out of treatment, um, how long, how long ago did you get that CD assessment done? Um, well, I'm still going to treatment one day a week, and I would probably say, I don't know, like six months? I'm not exactly, I might have actually just did one when I re-enrolled in treatment, but I'm not exactly sure. So, I'm pretty sure that when you have a CD assessment done, they're, they're good, like, they like to have one done every six months, so if you just had it done six months ago, um, then you, it'd probably be a lot easier just to get a new one done, because with, uh, the third parties that we use, they do them over the phone, and it's, like, just super simple, like, basically, online schedule it, and then they call you, and, um, yeah, and they just basically walk through, walk you through, like, you know, who am I, you know, what do you do, and what last time you used, and then, uh, you have to be, this is the part that's kind of important, is, like, you have to be sort of specific that you, like, we're referred by us, and that you're interested in getting peer recovery services, because that, that, uh, is a requirement for us to be able to work with you, as well, like, um, is we have, you have to have, uh, insurance requires, uh, an assessment that specifically states peer recovery services as a recommendation, and if, and also, also, in your case, I'm sorry, what'd you say? Oh, no, I was just saying we can get that scheduled. Yeah, yeah, and also, in your case, since you're looking for housing, you can actually also ask them, you tell them that, and you can, uh, yeah, tell them that, that you want, uh, that you're currently homeless, and then they can put in a couple of, like, you know, they know the vocabulary. Sorry. I'm in the sober house that Coco's in, so I'm not actually homeless yet. I'm trying to find assistance to cover January's rent, so. Right. So, I don't have to leave the sober house. Yeah, you don't have to. Well, that's good, but, uh, I don't know. Yeah. What should I put? It should say. Um, well, you can put whatever you like. Is it, whatever is the truth. I'm just, I have, I've had, I've had a lot of people put that they're homeless, and it, and, like, that kind of helps for processes, like, resources later on, if, if you have that referral in there, but once again, I'd want to put, have you put anything in there that's not truthful? Well, yeah, the only thing is, like, especially because I'm trying to find, like, a program or something to help with my January's rent, I just don't know if I would want to put homeless, because that may, you know, get in the way of trying to get help doing that. I don't know. Yeah, it helps. Um, but I do know. Well, I don't, I don't, I don't know. Well, I guess we can cross that bridge when we get there, for sure, but I just want to make sure that you, uh, yeah, right. Well, let's, yeah, you can put on there, no, you don't have an assessment, or you need an assessment, I guess, for the new one. Okay. Okay, so for the assessment, should I put no, or not sure? No. I actually didn't hear what you said. My GPS thing was talking to me. So, for the assessment, should I just put no? Is it asking, have you had an assessment done recently? Is that what it's asking? A few, when I, like, I don't know, like, five weeks ago, when I went back to treatment, when I moved in here to do the one day a week, he might have done one, but I couldn't tell you for sure. Well, would you be able to? Yeah, I would recommend just doing not another one. So, whichever one kind of says that, no, you haven't had one done, because they'll, they'll, they'll check one. Okay. What's my policy number? Insurance card. Do you currently have medical assistance? Yeah. Do you have your? Yeah, Google Plus, but I'm looking at my card, and I can't. It just says, like, I see a group number, but I don't see a policy number. Does it say ID and then a number by it? No, it says member number. Yeah, that's the one. Okay. Okay. Medicaid, or no, MNED. All right, thanks for submitting your contact info. Okay. All right, so then, good job on that one. Assessment. Yeah, yeah, let's go into the other one now, and do an assessment, or, you know, basically schedule an assessment or whatever. I don't mind scheduling this currently unavailable. Motherfuckers. They're fucking my process up. Okay, I do have another thing I can text you. That's, yeah, that's fine. If you want to text me it, and then I have another thing I can text you. Yeah, that's fine. If you want to text me it, and then I have a Zoom at 3 30 with my psychiatrist. If you want to text me, and then I can call you when we get, when I get off the Zoom, or text you, and see if you're free. Yeah, absolutely. Okay, I'll text it to you, and we can do it afterwards. All right. All right. Yep. Bye.",

I need to get on that **** local *****, like, gay group and **** start having ****. Yeah. I only have, like, five more minutes to talk, though, before I gotta let you go. Yeah. I'm sorry, dude. No, it's okay. I was... I don't really know, like, real jerks. I just took, like, **** eight shots. Oh, my God, dude. I'm so drunk right now. Dude, I was ****... Dude, I wanted to kill myself.

No, dude. She had the **** great idea. I mean, like... And I bought it. And the stupid bitch spilled half of it. And... Then, whatever she had left, and, like, this point, I was... Right before she left, after I **** said the worst things that I could ever say to her, like, her deepest, darkest secrets, **** what would hurt her. And... I drank all of it. It was you. It is. And I put that word, **** you, when she left. I swear to God, dude. Brandon, I promise. I am not that person. It's just, I... It's... Dude, she's ****... Been so mean to me for **** so long, dude. So **** long. Yeah, man. I'm excited to hear that. Yeah, dude, you're right. You know, you don't deserve that ****. And it finally exploded. And, like, every time she comes around, like, I'm ****... I've never felt this way, dude. Without even... Like... Like, I don't actually want to kill her, but, like, just... Or hurt her. Just take the **** out of her? Yeah, **** her life up, dude. Yeah. Yeah. But at the same time, you love her. Love the **** out of her. I get it. I totally get that ****. If she **** went straight... If she went straight, dude, I probably would. I would. Yeah. It's **** up, dude. It really is. And, like, I feel really bad. I feel really... And, like, I have, like, a couple problems. I ain't... Because I was so stupid, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, man.

Oh, Jesus. For real. Well, I feel like there's some things you probably couldn't have learned from this whole debacle. But I'm sorry. You're bad. You don't need me in your **** life, dude. It **** pisses me off, dude. Because, like, everything else that's going on, it just, like, aggravates, like, this **** spectrum that is more important than her. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. For real. You're on the spectrum. Why would you give her alcohol? It's hard. It is ****. Alright, man. Man, I love you, dude. I'm sorry you're having a bad day, dude. I'm sorry your bed took the **** brunch of it, too, dude. You don't deserve that ****. I'm sorry. Hey, bro. She was inside here for, like, 30 minutes, screaming meth head as hard as she could. But not anymore. We're not going to **** around, man. Like, **** around. Oh, man. Well, I'm sorry, dude. I hope you have a better day. Alright. But, hey, dude, if you got something wicked, because I don't know if you come up with some **** brilliant ideas. What? For what? To **** people's ****. Like, **** people's **** up, bro. Yeah, dude.

She just left my house. I don't know what's going on with her, but she said that she wanted to hurt herself. I'm really worried. She said that I don't know if she has a knife on her, but I think that somebody needs to intervene because her life may be in danger. Oh, my God. That's what she said she was going to do to me. I was thinking about doing the same **** to her, but I was going to ask her who she was riding with. That's all you got to do? That's all you got to do? And if you're texting that information? I can't do it because it's like the goop dealer and everything else. They don't know. She's not going to know it was you. Yeah, but I can't do it. Hey, bro. I've never done it. I can't do it. What were you like that, bro? What, is she still on parole? Yeah. Oh, alright then. Well, whatever. Well, you just said **** up her life, but I guess, yeah, that was a little extreme. Oh, my God. Like, I want her to lose. Like, dude, if she, like, gets a license back, you're getting hard. I'm all for that. That's like the perfect thing. Okay.

That's at mnenewalookup.com. That's mnenrenewalookup.com. Thank you. Hello. Can you hear me okay? Can I help you? Yes. Yeah, this is Brandon Gillis. Hi. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing okay. So I'm calling in regards to my medical assistance. I have a case number, if that helps. Yeah. One second. Okay, it's 25703348. All right, what's your question? So I have a family. I'm super confused how I've been. We haven't been on a lease for a little while now. And at first we were in Mora, which is Kanabec County. And then we stayed out in Washington County, which is Maplewood. We were there for like a month. And now we've been in Olmstead County in Rochester for about a month and a half now. And yeah, I received, like I applied for, okay, let me start over. My daughters, there was like a CPS case that occurred like, I don't know, like almost four years ago. And then I got them back in my custody in January of 2025. And they must have had to, at some point when they were with my mom, their foster parent, she must have switched everything to like her address and her as like the primary care, whatever. So I never got any notification to renew their policies. And then I got a notification probably about in November saying, well, actually from their providers, like their mental health providers and all that, saying that their information isn't going through anymore. So I found out that I needed to renew theirs, but they must have not been on the same plan as mine. And since then, yeah, like we moved a couple of places and I've had this conversation with like three different people now. But when I was expecting to get their proof of insurance cards in the mail and only mine showed up. All right. Did you fill out the paperwork to get those kids added to your case? I mean, I did years ago. I mean, I didn't I don't really know if it was like if they were put on somebody else's caseload or not. I'm a case. Yes, I have at some point, but not recently. No, I don't. Yeah. All right. So let's see. Are you able to get the paperwork or can I email it? Email would definitely be better. OK. Let me see. Is it still the legit guiles live dot com? Yes. OK. All right. I will get that paperwork sent to you via email and then just get that back to us. And then it's also my my kid's mom, too. So it's not just the kids. But adding her to my thing is kind of a new thing. And we just kind of got back together. We're still on it. We just got back into the same house. I think I'll just so I'm going to send you a whole application because then you can add everybody. So put you as a first person and then then there's the pages enough for your rest of your family. And then we'll see your active and then get them added to your case. That makes sense. Absolutely. OK, perfect. And then I'll get that email out to you. And then how soon can I expect to hear back from all this? Because I have like their provide like I have their providers, like their mental health providers, like are all reaching out to me. Because initially I heard it would be like I'll take care of. But. So we do have 45 days to process, however, we go back to the date we receive the application. OK. Yeah. So like if you get it back to us today, then we would start their coverage starting today. And it doesn't go back 90 days. There is a spot on the application you can select the retro coverage and it can go back up to three months. Oh, yeah, because I definitely need that. Yeah, I mean, you're active, but yeah, your kiddos aren't so. OK. OK, OK. Yeah. OK, I just sent the email for you. So, yeah, get it back to us. All right. All right. Perfect. Thank you so much. And is it is my is my caseworker Jackie? Is that what her name is? Or is that totally wrong? I'm not sure. Do you have food and cash and stuff? Are you saying or? I guess I'll just have to look at the paperwork. I'm not sure. I do. I did get a name, but I don't know. OK, yeah, because for your medical assistance, you work as just a team. You don't have a specific worker. Oh, OK. OK, I get it. All right. Well, thank you. I'll get that email sent out right away. And thank you. Yeah, no problem. Bye bye.",

    "transcript": "So, hey, what's up? Uh how you doing? Uh doing doing. That's good. That's good. Yeah. I'm just in the office right now. So, I got probably uh I don't know. Holy **** Uh 14 minutes to talk. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah. Wednesdays are really bad. I got my kid pretty much all day. Oh yeah. Yeah. So, Wednesdays are just kind of rough for me to get back. Um yeah. I feel you. Yeah. Well, congratulations on on joining the team. By the way, I'm **** totally missed saying that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Are you liking it? Are you enjoying it so far or is it just kind of yeah, I am like I wasn't just aware that like we had to find our own people and um it's just a lot of shuffling. Um you know, being a single parent, you know, but um things are working on. They're they're slowly but they're coming together, you know, so um but yeah, good. Yeah, it's all good. Yeah. So, so I don't know what you said. Oh, go ahead. Well, he said something like uh some kind of email like a private email or a or something. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, I I I keep a lot of notes. Uh yeah, obviously, I keep a **** a **** ton of notes because I if I had to like try to remember everything, like I'd be **** dead like yeah and um yeah. So, I mean, I got like uh I don't know just like I don't know. I guess how do I say this kind of simple to keep things simple like Zach is like my my problem child like he's a perfect example of like if you're working with him, you know, two steps forward, one step back and it's and it's wonderful. It's **** super wonderful and super rewarding to see like when he progresses and like when things are going great but it's like you have to like stay on him and it's good and it's good because you get you get the hours but like it's always it's also kind of a negative because sometimes you might be **** like you're like, hey, where is he? Like, I haven't **** nobody. Nobody knows where he's at for like three days and he might be out like walking in the cold or doing some stupid **** because uh I don't know but he really like, I don't know the big milestone is like he he does have some mental health issues that are that are like pretty clear and you know, he's got some court things going on right now and and uh yeah, it's like II would hate to see him go to prison for some stupid **** because he would be in in uh in a cell just one of those guys just screaming like I don't belong here and that's true. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a TBI. I think so. Like uh yeah, he he's, you know, a little bit of a skateboarder, you know, uh snowboarder and that's kind of his vibe and and you can tell like, you know, he he must, he must have been in a couple of accidents and it's not that he has told me he was in an accident. He has uh problems with his memory is what he told me. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So, I mean, as far as his sobriety, I don't really, I don't really couldn't really tell like you can you can tell some days, I don't know like uh uh some days like you'll you'll get him on the phone and this is a big thing and because like naturally, nobody wants to be rude and like but you'll get him on, you'll get him on the phone and he'll just like and he'll **** like ramble and ramble and **** ramble, ramble and you're like, you want to be polite. You're like, but then you gotta be like, alright, hey, we don't have that much time. So, I need you to listen up for a second. Yeah. And I mean, it's kind of, I don't know. I I I learned that after like like the second time I met with him, I was like, yeah, I'm sorry. We're I can't just let you ramble. This is what we're going to focus on and I don't know this. So, I mean that it's uh it's very new but it's I don't know, very fulfilling but I don't know II uh I don't want to say I get attached because I definitely uh his problem is his problems but I definitely like to see that guy succeed and I feel like his next few steps is managing his court situations which are kind of like uh like any any court situation like if he's talking to a public defender or something like that like I would highly highly actually it was almost like I don't know if I don't know if the word is required but like you gotta be there to like interpret what that public defender is saying to him and yeah yeah because he does not under **** stand at all. Yeah. Yeah. And I've talked to his public defenders. I've talked and I've I've done. I've done all of that and um yeah and he and the one time that I don't go there because I was like I wasn't sure if it's court hearing like uh like **** significantly back pedal. It just all kind of went backwards but uh and uh and uh that's what the email is about. Like, I'm going to basically put together like uh you know, his court dates, you know, uh some details about the court dates and you know, phone numbers and um I don't know. I got I have like uh with his permission, I have all of his like personal information like a social security card, driver's license. Um probably like obviously that kind of like a personal personal. I don't know what you would call it but yeah and so it's so it keeps things simple again. So, it's court hearings and like initiating these mental health and uh steps, you know, try to get him like process for like uh those assessments for like so you can get approved for housing. Yeah. Right now, he's he has no housing and he has a dog. Um yeah. So, I know that housing is he's on their radar but he missed their last appointment. So, yeah. Um yeah, that's like another thing to follow up on like immediately. Yeah. Um does he have finances? Yeah. Yeah. He does. He gets a $900. Uh I don't know. It's like uh I think it's some sort of like disability but he gets like yeah, $900 on the first of every month and that's like uh and he usually gets it on a card but sometimes he'll lose the card and he'll have to get a new one and he that's happened probably six times out of the year. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. So, yeah, this guy will keep you **** really super busy and um and honestly, if there comes a situation where like, I don't know you he needs assistance in the middle of the night or something crazy **** like that. I I can I can make myself available and in those cases and you know, kind of captain sort of thing. Yeah. I don't know. So, what are your thoughts? Uh do you have any thoughts on this so far? Uh not really. I mean, it's just basically uh I just gotta yeah. Just get to know him and know what's up and then just go from there. Like I mean, Yeah. I'm not too worried. I just gotta figure out what needs to be done. I guess, you know, like, yeah. So, another thing. Um uh so II had another client um that is in the area. Her name is Cassie Jacobson and when I when I transferred her to Bella who's another one of our coworkers um like I was able to make like uh like a three like we did a basically did a three-way call because you know Bella called Cassie. Cassie's like, huh? And then Cassie called me and she's like, what's going on? And I was and then I explained to her again. I was like, you know, I gotta I had to move up. I had to like switch offices. So, this is the new person like this person is **** awesome. You can trust this person like and then we just kind of like, I don't know, just kind of talk on the phone and just a little just about nothing important but just kind of about getting to know each other and because like a big thing is trust and like, I don't know. He's yeah, he's going to he might be a little skittish and about trusting people and like he thinks that like people are going to **** throw him in the like cell or **** bring him to a hospital and he's going to get locked up and all these things are things that make him nervous but like if you're if you're that guy that goes and picks him up when he's on the side of the road like he'll **** trust you forever. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. I try to get him into more recovery things but like one day he hates the idea. One day he's interested and I'm like, I don't know as long as he's like I can have a conversation with him and I can and I know for sure he's not **** high as hell because that's great. Those are those days are good. What's his DLC? Math. Math. Alright. Yeah. Yeah. But he's definitely it's yeah, I can't. I mean, like I said, I can't really tell. I mean, it's only tell I think is when he **** rambles and when he starts to ramble and ramble and ramble, I get suspicious and I'm like, I don't know if this guy's sober and but other days, he's totally fine. I don't know. Well, between that and mental health or you know, I don't know. Yeah. You know, I think it's sometimes, you know, they get in a manic stage and that madness. I mean, do it like 6 months. It takes over 6 months to get out and recover from that. Yeah. To start recovering. You know what I mean? Just your mental and Yeah. Yeah. And this is kind of another one of the things like about getting hold of him like he does have a phone. I think he needs to get a new phone because he kind of **** it up a little bit too much but like he's got a working phone line and but II like to personally, I personally don't like to like that on my social media. Yeah. But I had I had to with him because it was like otherwise, it was almost like a no way of getting a hold of him sometimes. If you make plans with them, is he pretty pretty good at sticking with him or I mean, this is the way I would make plans with him like I would talk to him the night before and and like be like, okay or actually no. Actually, I have done this. I'm like, okay, your days are Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday every morning. So, and I'll talk to him the night before, you know, I'll call him before I like I leave the house and and that's that's been pretty solid because if he knows, if he knows Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday are your days with him, that's his time and if he picks up those days and it's on him like he's pretty good at that. He's really, really pretty good at that but you have to like set these boundaries with him but at the same time, try not to give up on him. I don't know. Yeah. No, I ain't I ain't going to give up on anybody but It's really easy to like let somebody get lost in the system and like that's what I I had talked with Miles like a couple times like just kind of concerned that he's going to like lose interest or **** fall into a like a depressive state or something. Yeah. Yeah, I know II think it'll be good. I relate really good with people. So, All kinds of people. So, I think I think it'll be alright. Um I mean, if he's okay with me, I don't, you know, I don't I don't like dress up or nothing like that. You know what I mean? I just kind of like who I am and you know, so good. Yeah. You know, like, I don't know. Some people are like, oh, you don't think I'm like professional but I don't know. I'm just always always got something cruising on. You know what I mean? Like, you know, so um I'm just pulling up to my next appointment. So, yeah, yeah, that's good. Um we're sending over whatever. I have a little more time this afternoon if we need to um touch base or whatever. I don't know. Yeah. Um but I'll just kind of look forward to that email. I see you whipping around the parking lot. I was like, this is like a Mustang or something. Okay, I'll I'll call you back, Will. Alright, man. Have a good one. Yeah, you too. I'll talk to you soon. Yup.",

    "transcript": "Good morning, Miles. How are you doing? Good morning, Brandon. I'm doing well. How are you? Doing okay. I think I might be getting a little bit of a cold again. I don't know. Uh-oh. That's okay. Yeah. I've had one. I'm like almost, almost done with it. Yeah. It's crazy. The mother of my child, she got sick at the same time as me and then got better right away. And then now she's claimed to be feeling sick again as well. We don't live together or see each other. So that's like her thing. It's crazy that, you know, she could have it twice in one week. You would think that there would be some type of antibodies or something built up, you know? Right, right. Yeah. Yeah, I've seen you send me a text message this morning already and I'm not in front of the computer right now. I'm on the road. Okay. No worries. But I can only assume that the numbers, the client you may be referring to, I noticed that like immediately after I submitted those documents, like those DAP notes and RWPs last night, like I looked at my phone and because I have this person's number in my phone now, like he came up as somebody I may know on Facebook. Hey, Brandon, I couldn't hear like 30 seconds of what you just said. Can you repeat that please? Yeah, sorry. I am going through a bad service area. It's okay. I'm patient. Okay. At least I understand. Yeah. Take your time. Yeah. So I submitted those RWPs and my DAP notes for last night. And like immediately afterwards, I looked at my phone. And since I have this person's number in my phone now, he came up as somebody I may know on Facebook. And the name was wrong. Somebody you may know on Facebook? Yeah. So like I made a note for a person. Brandon, I'm sorry. Oh, shit. I can't hear you right now. Okay. I'll try calling you in a few minutes, okay? Yeah. If you can hear me now, I'll just call you back in a few minutes. Okay. As a matter of fact, yeah, just call me back when you can. Okay. Because I want to hear what you're saying. Okay. Thank you. All right.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Hello. Sorry. It's much better now. Okay. Yeah, yep. I can hear you now. Sorry about that. Yeah, so, um, I. So when I was submitting all my notes last night like, and our WP is. So, she said that this person that she, she said that somebody came into the office yesterday, and she like knew had like a personal relation with them so she said that she couldn't do it herself. She wouldn't like. So, I'm gonna introduce you to Brandon, and I could, and I was almost certain that she said her name, his name was Coda. And when I was looking around on like the percent of, I couldn't find anybody named Coda so I was like okay maybe she said, Cody. So I found this person named Cody who was approximately the same age. And it was like 1130 at night. So I couldn't like collar. I was just pretty confident that that was the name. So I did my job note and my recovery wellness plan for a person named Cody. And then as soon as I was done, like, I realized that I had this person's number in my phone but I didn't, I don't think I saved it correctly. Because I like looked on Facebook, and, and the person who I was supposed to be doing the DAP note for popped up on my Facebook as somebody I may know, and it was like Coda, something like that. I'm almost positive that I put it as put a, I created a DAP note and a recovery wellness plan for somebody that is not the person I met yesterday. Yesterday. I don't see. I don't see any wellness plans from yesterday. I see one for Janelle McCarter on 114 which was two days ago. But otherwise, I don't, I don't see anything so hold on, can I can I ask you something. So, I had a conversation with Lacey this morning, where there was a question about a client 1730 to be added to your list and that was what I texted you about. And their name is Dakota Barnes, is that who you're referring to when you say, Yes. Okay. Okay, all right, but I'm okay so we got that figured out but like, I don't understand. I don't see you said you did wellness plans in percentage, but I don't see them on here. Yeah, they should be. Basically I created them, I put like one line in there, and then I was going to add like the rest of the stuff to it today. I don't see. I don't see anything. Because when I because because because when I click on because because when I clicked on their name. They had been seen twice, once in June by Rachel and once in September by someone named Gabriel. I don't see anything on. And again I think that was the reason why, let me look at my text I think that was why Lacey had. I talked to her this morning. I don't know, because I know that I did create them. It would have been, and I was like, I was like, wanted to make sure that they were all submitted, you know, the day of so I like kind of cheated a little bit and I just like created them and I put like one line in there and then I saved it and. Yeah, I mean, I'm. Again, maybe I could maybe I could make sense out of it more when I like open my thing. Yeah, I would definitely pull up your screen or screens. I mean, that's still though that's weird, because they, they, they auto save, you know, so even if you didn't like intentionally save it when you signed it at the bottom or lock it, it would still still should be there but I don't see it. I don't see any like. Or, or, which is like a feature to like track like the hours for people, and then, or I didn't see the service line which is like the note that's attached to it. What about the depth notes, the depth notes aren't showing up either. That's what I'm saying yeah that's what I'm saying that's what I'm referring to yeah there's no depth note either. Like, in on everything that I'm looking at on his screen on his chart, there's the last time he was seen was in September. So, so I got a chance to that person. Yeah, I mean, like no but again like when I'm looking at your screen then there's there's that doesn't show any of that either. So, hold on one second, let me, let me look at your appointment block. Yeah, I mean it's not on there either. And so I mean at the end of the day, the solution to all of that would just be to to do the note for yesterday, and to do the, the wellness plan for yesterday as well. So if you mean you say you did it or you try to do it and you started to do it like that's not necessarily like relevant in the sense of like it just needs to be done. So, and he is added to your list. So, you will be able to create that. And, yeah, you can just, you know, I mean, text me or let me know when it's done. But if you could do the, the wellness plan as well that would be great. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. I'm going to let you go. I'll talk to you later. Okay, call me if you need me. Okay, sounds good. I'll talk to you soon. Okay. All right.",

OK, so it turns out that you did do the charting for the wrong person, the wrong Cody. So I had to figure out how to change that and delete that and then put it on the right person. So you let me double check your appointment, but you need to give a note for the right person when you get when you get the chance today. OK, so thank you. Yes. Yep. It's very foolish of me. It's OK. It it happens. OK, so now I change the appointment to the right person now. So now you would just click click on appointments and they click on time ad and then and then go about it the regular way. OK. OK. All right. Cool. Thank you. Yep. You're welcome. I'll talk to you later. Oh, and then when you do that, can you do the the wellness plan? Because I didn't see anything for, you know, like how you had made the appointment for the wrong person. I didn't see the wellness plan for the wrong for that person either.

No, you're good, man. Listen, I'm good. Okay, that sounds good. Are you able to meet, or were you referring to the Collette well before when you said you got them all done? Say that again? You had mentioned that you got them all done and so you're saying 19-20 and the... Yeah, there was a Janelle McCarter. I did an RWP for her on the 14th, but I like did like basically the shortcut where I created it, put one line in there and then just saved it. Well, I went back and I completed all of it, so it's not just one line anymore. Okay. And Collette, that's like a different client, but she's the last time I seen her, she checked herself into an inpatient program, so I probably won't be seeing her for a couple months. Oh yeah, you did say that, okay. Alright, sounds good. Yeah, that's good to know. Okay, alright, well I just figured I'd mention that to you, make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

And so, the pictures that were, like, our, like, example or whatever, it's, like, a black and white picture, but it doesn't look like, it's still hard for my imagination to figure out which parts I'm supposed to paint black and which ones I should leave white. And so, I saved the picture, put it through chat, and I was like, hey, can you make this into a Noten style picture, like, just black and white values? And then I did it, and then I saved it, and then I fucking opened it on my computer, and I just sketched it onto my paper from my screen. Nice. Yeah.

No, because it's MLK Day, so there's no class, and it would be, yeah, it would be, like, right now if there was class. Okay, well, do you want to do that thing right now? Well, because I just got done with all my, like, phone calls that I needed to do for being, like, on the way to the office, so now we're going to do that thing. We should do that now. Okay. Are you okay with that? I guess. I mean, there's no harm in fucking applying, but the worst they could say is no. That's absolutely correct. Okay. All right, so are you gonna, I don't know which way, how do you want to, you want to, like, Facebook call me so that you can screen share? Sure. All right, well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna hang up the phone, and I'm gonna let you Facebook call me then. Okay. All right, bye.",

I don't know. Do you want to... Do you want to talk? Talk to me about it, or... He left me. He... Okay, so we were at Zach's last night... Or not last night, but the night before. I fell asleep, and Zach was missing, or whatever. Like, well, not missing, but like, he wasn't... He didn't come back. And so, Zeke and I were talking, and I was like, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. So, Zeke and I were there with Bear and his mom, and then Zach just showed up at like five something in the morning yesterday, and Zeke was gone. Bro, you took off when I was asleep. So, you're saying Zach showed up out of? And Zeke took off, yeah. With Zach, or like after? No, like he was there with... Like, me and Zeke were with Bear at his mom's. Oh, yeah? The entire time Zach was gone. Well, Zach showed up yesterday morning at five. I guess Zeke let him in the door, or whatever. T was the one who dropped him off, and I'm pretty damn positive that Zeke left with T. So, he's been with T still. He still was her. Okay. Yeah. And just doesn't want to answer me or anything. What's the significance of that? Like he's... Is his phone not working or something? No, he just doesn't know how to turn it on or keep it charged. Were you guys like having... Even then, she doesn't fucking ever... She's not answering her phone. Yeah. Yeah, that's frustrating. I'm sorry. Way to fucking help me keep that shit out of my head. Yep. Okay. That's going real well. Yeah. What, between him and them two or something? Is that where you're... Has that ever been a thing in the past? No, but he told me that he wanted to sleep with her or something. Hmm. Well, I don't... I can't say that I've ever had that conversation with them myself, but if I were to... Like, go ahead and speak for him in this instance, I don't think that she's... Yeah, I don't think she's the one that she would... I don't think she's the one he would cheat on you with. No offense to T. I think so. Only because he's told me before he's wanted to sleep with her, so... Oh. But you did mention that you... That Zach came back. Mm-hmm. So he's at his mom's now? No, I know. Right now he is... Bryant, 1818. Oh, okay. Oh, shit. Bryant. His phone's not charging. It is charging or it is not? No, it's not charging. Yeah. I was going to see if my... Somebody can bring me up to Walgreens so I can put money on my card, so then I can pay for my phone. Yeah. I was going to be able to call you when I get there. Have you talked to Bella at all lately? Because she would be one of those people. Let me see outside. She would be one of those people that I could call. Can you still hear me? Yeah. It's fucking colder than shit out right now. Yeah, no, I was just trying to... Kind of check on you guys. I got to have a conversation with Zach's new CPRS, and I was just kind of calling around to see where he had warrants, and I guess he does have a warrant out of Anoka County. Yep, I looked that up the other day. Yeah, but the thing with his mom, like the thing where he was getting a... The Rule 20 thing was required or whatever? Can you hear me? Yeah, like I couldn't... Like I can't pull up any information on that because of like the nature of that case. Even though it's like public, it's not something I can look up without having to hold. But, yeah, I don't know. But I guess I was just trying to get his new CPRS, like all the information that he needs to like, you know, be useful, I guess, is what I'm trying to say, get out. Okay. Can you hear me now? Yes. Okay. Have you been outside yet today? No. It's like negative six degrees out right now. Ish. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Go on to... But you don't know when you're going to see Zach again? I'm supposed to be going over to where he's at right now. But I'm going to go pay for my phone first. Okay. Sounds good. All right, well, let me... Give me a call as soon as you do get a hold of him or see him. Okay. Thank you. Yep, no problem. Bye. Bye.",

It's the day of making dreams, you know, dreams to reality if you want it to be. I feel like that's the way to look at it is, you know, I feel like since he passed away today, his dreams never had a limit to be put on it. So, like, they could be whatever you want it to be. Like, it can grow as far as you wanted it to. I don't know. I've got a different way of looking at things a little bit. I've seen this one meme this morning that said, like, I guess my employer doesn't think my dream, any dreams matter because I have to go into work. Well, yeah, man. Good morning. Yeah, yeah. This is my number. I got you saved in as a contact, too. I got you saved in as a contact, too. Yeah, I don't really, I might be at arms today if you are. Yeah. I left my bag there. I have my damn charger I left there. Fucking it has all my important shit I left over there. So, I got to go over there and get that. You know where you left it? It's in Alex's office. Okay. I guess I could actually grab it and run it out to you if it would help you at all. But I'm going to be running around a little bit. Yeah. You know, I'll set it as a motivator to actually get out of the house today. You know, if I see you, I see you. Um, but yeah, um, yeah, is there? Yeah, yeah, there was actually something. Because if you remember, I had to do a recovery wellness plan for you. Kind of just based off of our conversation. And, um, and, um, yeah, actually, so I need you to take a look at that. So that I can have you sign it and kind of like, uh, no, no, it's not. It's, uh, but it's like, yeah, it's definitely easier for me to just show you in person. That way, if there's like something different, I want to, you want me to put on there? Because this is basically like, what is your insurance is going to see this. And, um, okay. And, uh, so, so you're not, you're not working, right? Oh, no, I, uh, I need to find a job very, very ASAP. Oh, yeah. It's yeah. Yeah. Well, um, let's see. I, uh, I know a guy that actually that's in the area. He's like a contractor. Well, anyways, he does, he does construction and he's got like more work than, than he can like handle. He needs a hard worker, dude. I'm a hard worker. I damn. So you set a goal. If I can then, if it's, uh, in town, like commute, it's not them. Like I have to go all the way to the cities and shit. Cause I obviously don't have a car, but by, if I can them, if I can have a place to be a time and what to do, I can get it done. You sure? I mean, I can, I can, it sounds like it'd be a good opportunity. Yeah, no, it's, if it's an opportunity, I just got done working from Grady. It's just, um, like, dude, I had a whole house, damn 12 months, damn lease on that shit. And fucking, I don't know. I just got my head and mixed in with a bunch of people that, you know, I was trying to get you know, I shouldn't have, and then let their view get, get to my damn way of how I should move my life. And I altered my growth and I fucked it all up and fucking, but everything's for a reason. So, um, I've been looking for good, uh, job opportunities since, but like, I grew up off of like horse farm, like my mom owns a horseback riding stable. It's like, I know, I know schedule on no fucking, you know, a hard work. That's what I do. I like hard work. That's cool. Damn. Damn. I didn't know that about you. Yeah. Yeah. It's actually some kind of somewhat, somewhat in common, I guess you could say. I mean, I didn't grow up in like the farming thing, but that was actually like my first, uh, business that I ever owned was like, uh, it was like a farming business, but I could tell you twist to it. Horseback riding. Hey, it's a killer. It's a fucking killer. Damn. Uh, it's, it's like horseback riding. Like she has this big trail and she fucking, she pays or people pay her to ride the trail and like, damn, like it has Jim mining and like, you know, a petting zoo. Like she's added all that throughout the years, but fucking, you know, it's, it's different. It's like not really, really farmed. I guess. Is she able to do that? Like all by herself or does she have like, she's got 180, 80 horses. Like it's, it's, it sounds like it's small business for the way I'd pitch it off, but like, it's just hard for me to talk about it because I don't really talk about my family anymore because there's just something I gotta let go. But you know, she's, she's a damn multi-million dollar fucking company. Damn. You can search her up too. It's, it's called the Ponderosa in Peter Ford's, Tennessee, you know, pop, he'll pop right up the fucking horseback riding. Damn. That's her. That's cool. Um, but yeah, I really need a job. Well, yeah, I, I, I can probably help sort you out. I, um, but I guess I got your phone number now. Where are you, where are you fucking living? Like how far away from the office do you live? I live by, I live by river station. So just by Talahi. Yeah. University. Oh yeah. Okay. I know that one. All right. Uh, well, so you say you're gonna, you're gonna kind of mosey over to the office sometime today? Yeah, no, I'm getting, I'm getting ready for the day now. I just, I honestly like, yeah, I gotta get up for the day and you know, my mind, I'm not scrambled eggs, but no, I'm not, no judgment, dude. I'm fucking driving right now and I'm like multitasking like a motherfucker. So yeah, I'll get in touch with you though. Yeah, for sure. For sure, dude. And if I, and if you don't get in touch with me, like I'm going to stalk you like a fucking, like the terminator. All right. Well, you know, I'll be damn, I'll post my billboards right out here. All right. But, um, God bless. Uh, I'll get in touch with you. All right. All right. For sure. I'll talk to you soon. Have a good day. All right. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Good afternoon. Thank you for calling sobriety first. This is Aaron. Hi, Aaron. This is Brandon Gillis with Generation Hope. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Wonderful. Wonderful. So I'm actually sitting with a client right now, and I'm just kind of following up. Because he was staying at the Lincoln Center. He did his intake over there, and he says that he... But now he's at the Place of Hope, but he was saying that while he was at the Lincoln Center doing that intake, somebody from Sobriety First was able to do his assessment while, like, over there. When was that? Thursday or Friday. And I guess we were just following up with that to see if you guys have his information. Sure. Who is the client? The client is Eric Wilson, and he's sitting with me right now. Okay. Hi, Aaron. Are you still with me? I am. I just don't have... I'm releasing my information for you, so I can't share anything with you. Maybe I could just put you on the phone with him? Yes, if he's there, that would be just fine. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that I said that part. Yeah, go ahead. Hello? Hello? Hello? Is this Eric? Yeah, this is me. Okay. So we did have your... We did do your assessment and forwarded it to the places that you requested. My understanding was that you were getting a ride to treatment. Is that not true? Yeah, but I had just did med patients, so they felt like by me already doing med patients that it wasn't going to work out. So they just wanted me to go do what I got to do to go to outpatient. Okay. Let me see. So I'm back in St. Cloud now. But your assessment says... I believe it said inpatient. Let me look. Yeah, but they had already asked you to do the residential, so I don't know why the residential would have turned you away saying that you were doing it. You know what I have to do from this step now? Do y'all have places for people to go to besides the place of hope for people to be? Because I'm sleeping on the mats and I'm around people that's using it, trying to be strong and stay focused. I can ask the admissions team if they'll be willing to change the 3.5, but I don't know if that's going to be the case. We don't necessarily have any housing that we work with or anything like that. So I thought that would be able to get you out of where you're at, but like change place. Have you checked in to change place yet? Where's it called? Change place. Change place? How do you spell it? C-H-A-N-G-E and then place. Okay. Let me see if I can. I'm working from home today, Eric, so I don't have all my references. They're all at work. So we're living, change as possible. But they are going to require that you're in some sort of treatment. You know what I mean? Yeah. Let me get you a phone number. Phone number for St. Cloud area, 320-527-0000. Okay. So, I mean, if you want me to, I will send a ticket out and see if we can do an outpatient service for you. But I don't know. I mean, I could try it. Okay. That'll be good. Okay. So I'll send a ticket off to the team, to the admissions team now, just stating that, you know, you're interested in our programming, seeing if we can still do that. But in the meantime, I would call the change place if you want to get out of place to hope and see what we can do. The other, the other thing is that the recommendations for your assessment are all going to be inpatient places because that was the recommendation. But I feel like, let me see. Like, do they have outpatient with allergen? That's what I was going to look at, see if, if what your, what your assessment is and what it looks like. Let me see. And where's the recommendation letter? We don't necessarily have, we don't necessarily have the recommendations. She just said, these are the ones that are inpatient. So, North, our regional project turned about, I don't know, where did you end up starting? Of this assessment. Yeah, yeah. Request for generation hope. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, let's do that. Let me see. Okay. Yeah. Lunch. What do you be having for that I eat some noodles good thing I eat some. Yeah. Okay. Here. Alright, so let me see here. Make sure I have your email. Okay. Okay. Okay. Come through. There. Okay. Hi. Oh my goodness. Okay. So, I have a, I have a Jasmine. Yeah. Okay, hold on. Okay, go ahead. Thank you. What. So it's legit. Legit. Uh huh. And G I L L E s. Jill G I L L E s. Yeah, live and live.com so it's legit gills G I L L E s at live.com. Okay. So, backspace a gillette G I L L E s at live.com. Right. Yeah. Yep. Yep. Okay. All right, I just sent her over. Okay. I'm going to sign at the bottom. It's a very, very small little based on the very bottom of that. As soon as I received that, then you have them at your release of information. I can send over the. If you want me to send that Eric, I just don't know. Yeah. So that you can have that. Are you then going to help him with. Yes. Yeah, whatever that, whatever your recommendation says is what we're going to be following through with. Well, the recommendation says inpatient. So. Okay. Project turnabout was one of those places as well. Was there. Yep. Yep. We turn. We, we sent it forward to. Let me see. Replacement. Okay. And then I do not know what. Eden is, but we sent it there. Okay. Yeah, that's a place. In the cities. Okay. So in order for those three places. Okay. And. I am so sorry. The connection is kind of crappy. What's up. So in order for us to. I say if it was project turnabout. So we just got to get in touch with them and then make arrangements with them at that point. It's pretty simple, right? Correct. Yep. You can reach out to them and just see if they have availability. So if they have a bed available. And then coordinate, you know, obviously, when that looks what that looks like, and then a ride. Okay. I just didn't know if that was still something that he was interested in, or if we wanted to just do. With the assessment. So, well, that's definitely a conversation. You want to. So what she's asking is she, her recommendation, and the assessment suggested an inpatient program. And it sounds like you're requesting an outpatient program now, which is like a lower level of care. But I guess we're asking you because this is a decision that you would have to make. Yeah. I'm going to do outpatient because I just did inpatient. Yeah, we're going to do outpatient. All my probation officers want me to do is my last step. Okay. All right. And then I'm. Does the assessment need to reflect the outpatient then rather than an inpatient program? I don't know. I don't know how that works on that. Typically, they can request a lower level of care without having that have to be changed. If you if you run into a situation where they're having issues with that or he's having issues with that, you can always call me and I can have Karen change it. But they should be just fine. And I tell him I will forward that, like I said, I'll get it on to our inpatient or our outpatient programming. Just now. But then we wouldn't we wouldn't have any ability for him to state we have no logic. So. Okay. Okay. I understand. So we're actually looking at this ROI right now. It's open. And you're familiar with the intake email for Generation Hope. Yes. Sorry, I don't know if you get asked that question like 12 times a week or not. I'm sorry. No, no, no, no, no. It's been a thing for us. So on our for like when Heidi comes over, we have. We have the email just not on. The ROI, for whatever reason, it does not cross over onto the ROI but on my contact sheet I have the email so I do know the email is just not on that. Okay. Okay, so I don't need to, I don't need to change it on this on this ROI I'm looking at right now. If you want to add it to that'd be fine. If you want to. And then, because, and then would it be possible to also make put a note to update that assessment so that it recommends CPRS services as well. It does on. If you want to receive it you'll notice, you'll, you'll see assessment for placement it does say utilize peer services at the very bottom of it and also utilize peer services as needed peers, it says utilize peer recovery services as needed on the very bottom. So, all right, so I'm going to have Eric step forward and do his digital signature on this thing and then. Okay. Then I can send it, I will send this over to you if you want a copy of the assessment. Yes, please. I don't have a recommendation letter so the recommendations are in the bottom corner on the left of the whole thing down at the bottom. And I okay to be a witness on this. You don't need to witness anything it's fine. Okay. We don't need a witness. I will skip that part. Yeah, sorry I didn't, I didn't say anything. All right, so staff signature that sounds like you guys. Me. There should be like a send back or return or something. Okay, submitted that. Hopefully I didn't mess that up because those are still a little foreign to me but I got it here. Look. Oh yeah no you're good. I see what you did. You're fine. But it may not let me open somewhere. I'm so sorry, by the way, I didn't get your name. Oh, I'm. That's okay. My name is Aaron. Okay. I'll write it down for you to. Okay, so it sounds like you got the ROI, so it's all good. And then you were able to send that assessment to me and my intake coordinator lady. Yeah, it's gonna. If it's okay with you, it may be till tomorrow before I can email that assessment over to you I don't know, because right now I'm working from home and I don't have access to our email. I'm trying to figure out how to get it to you. Maybe I can get it from from me to Trina and then Trina can forward it on from the actual email for work because otherwise you're getting my personal email and I mean, I don't mind it but I just don't want everybody to think that that's the way to get a hold of me. That's not right. And so, um, let me see what I can do and I'll try and get it over to you guys yet today. No problem. Okay. And thank you for for all that. Yes, yes. Not a problem. Appreciate the help. If there's a, I'm going to share the, your number and name and number with Eric in case he needs to get ahold of you in the future. Eric, do you have, can I have your number just in case because I did forward on a ticket to our outpatient services admission team to see whether or not they would be willing to do the outpatient for our facility so you can take my dad, my emergency number is my arm. I don't have a place to be. Yeah, he doesn't have it doesn't have a working phone line at the moment. Gotcha. So it'd be like his emergency contact phone number. That would be his best one for now. Do you guys want that. Okay. Yeah, just in case. All right, it's a 504-201-9035. Okay, perfect. All right, so when they get back in touch with me I can get back in touch with him and at least let him know that that's an option if he's interested. Otherwise I'll send this over to you momentarily. Okay. Oh, do you know do you have a fax I could fax it over from my system I just can't email you know you have a fax right up here. I bet I'm willing to bet that we do. I'm. Give me a moment I find out really quick. You're fine. Absolutely. Okay. I love technology. I just asked six people. If we just have, I just asked six different people if we have a fax number. So hopefully. Yeah. Oh, okay. I do get it. I did get a response. Okay, so I will fax that over to that number I where it goes to you guys I don't know, but I will fax that over to you. Okay, so I will fax that over to that number I where it goes to you guys I don't know, but I'll send it over to you now. Just know, we do typically email them over because I know that you guys like that by email to go to your intake team. But just because of where I'm at and circumstances today, I prefer to just use the fax today if possible. So, okay. Um, and then otherwise, we'll, we'll be good. So, um, okay, I'm super thank you for all that I do have another one last follow up question, because I actually I sent us another client, your way, you did a walk in on Friday, and somebody got the ROI filled out for generation hope. And I guess I just wanted to follow up and make sure, because I think he said that there might have been a hang up or something. Client's name is Matthew, Matthew. I don't know why I'm blanking his last name. Last name starts with an M. And if, if you want, I can hold off on asking questions until he's actually here with me, which would make better sense. Okay, hold on. Is it Matt Marcellus Marcellus Thank you. Yeah. Yeah, no he signed a release. What is it that he. What was his question or what is your question. Well, just that, uh, that it got over to our intake coordinators was the, did he sign an ROI for us and all that, and did it all get sent over. He signed a release for you guys. We did not send it to you the assessment, but I can send the assessment to you. So, I'll send that one after I send over Eric's to you. Okay, that one too. Okay, cool cool thank you. All right. All right. Is there anything else Brandon are you good to go. Good to go. This time for sure. Thank you so much. No problem. You have a great day. You too. Bye bye.",

How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing okay. So, I'm actually, my name is Brandon Gillis. I'm calling on behalf, I'm with Generation Hope, calling on behalf of a client named Eric Wilson, and we're just trying to get some more information about your intake process and if you guys have any beds available. Yeah, absolutely. So, as of right now, I do not have a bed available, but I do have some mails that are supposed to be scheduled, and let me see if this person, okay, sorry, I was just trying to see if there was any update on the person that's scheduled right now. So, as of right now, we don't have any beds available. That doesn't mean that we're not going to have a bed later tonight or tomorrow morning. Things do change very quick. How this works is, I don't know if he's ever been with us before, but let's just say he hasn't. So, we would start by creating a chart, and then we would go through an intake screening. So, asking him a bunch of questions about how he's feeling today and about his use, and then at that point, we would move forward from that. Okay, I understand. And then, you also, like, represent more than one facility. Yep. Okay. Okay. Okay. We have one in Ember Grove, and then we also have one in Brooklyn Park. Excuse me. And the one in Brooklyn Park, is that a males facility? Both of them are co-ed. Oh. Okay. The rooms are separated by gender, though. Right. Of course, of course. I'm actually an alumni at the Waverly facility. Oh. It's a really nice facility. It is nice, yeah. I frequently recommend people go into that place. What about the ones you're talking about, the co-ed ones? They're all co-ed, but it's not like, even though they have men and women at the same facility, like, they don't do their, they don't interact with each other. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I have Eric with me right now, if you want to do those intake questions now, or if that happens later. However, do you want to, yeah, we can move forward. We can definitely do one with him right now, and then let's say if all of my men show up tonight, and we have to either get, I don't see any discharges as of right now for tomorrow, but I can get his intake done. And then once we do get closer and we're able to schedule him, you would just have to update a couple of questions as far as last date of use and current, like, are you hallucinating, having any suicidal ideation, so anything that can really change in a couple of days. Okay. So then I can actually just hand the phone over to him right now. And then you guys hit it. And I understand that even though you don't have availability right now, something could open up in the next day or two or three, and then you would give us a call back. For today. So that would be something where he would continue to call us. So right now I have one at four that's supposed to be showing up, but he does not show, or I'm sorry, I have one at three that's supposed to be showing up. And if he doesn't show up by 3.30, then at that point I have that bed available. So he could definitely try calling later today, or I would suggest right away at 7 a.m. tomorrow when we start taking calls, because anybody that leaves overnight, those beds would then open up. And it rotates very quickly sometimes. Yeah, absolutely. It would be calling back the same number that I called you on right now. Let me give you, I'm assuming it's not our direct admissions number. So let me give you that one. Whenever you're ready. Yeah, yeah. All right. It is 519993537. You did say 651, right? I did say 651. Yep. Okay. Okay. Even though I say Waverly, I understand. Are you looking for Waverly? Are you looking for detox? Are you looking for a program? Not detox. We're looking for like an inpatient or outpatient programming. Never mind. Okay. That would be a different department. So they may have an opening within the next week or something like that. We're detox. Oh, okay. So that's what, yeah. So you are, it's very different than what I said. Right. But I guess this is detox. We're talking to the detox intake and not like the IOP or inpatient program. Yeah. I mean, I know that they do do transportation when it is available. Yep. Okay. So in order to do the intake, that's not the detox. Do I just call the different, totally different phone number and start over? I will transfer you. So don't worry about that. I'll transfer you. I'll stay on the line. I'll let you get to someone. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Absolutely. One moment. I was trying to ask what they come to the same. I even on brand. I'm right there too. That's cool. Okay. Oh, sorry. Hi, this is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Good. How can I help you out? So I'm calling Brandon Gillis with Generation Hope. I'm calling on behalf of Aaron, Eric Wilson, who is with me right now. And we're getting some more information about, we just had a CD assessment done. And that assessment was sent out to a couple of different places. And we're just following up to try to get more information about the intake process. Yeah. Let me take a look. Yeah. Okay. When was the assessment sent? I think it was sent yesterday. Right. Yeah. Sent out Friday. Okay. And I think it would have been coming from sobriety first. Okay. What was his date of birth? 12. 13. 1990. Eric Wilson, correct? Yes. Eric Wilson. Okay. And I have him with me right now. I don't know if you want to talk to him. I can just hand the phone over. You're good. I'm just seeing if we received the assessment or not. Okay. Okay. Yeah. I'm not seeing anything that's been processed since Friday for him. Most likely. It looks like he was with us not too long ago. So we'll probably need to get that assessment and then staff it with a treatment director to see which sites we could get into. Okay. Okay. And then. Let's see. So. In case. It wasn't just automatically sent to you guys. Right. Is there an email or a fax number that. We can send that assessment to. Which would be easier. Fax or email for you. Definitely email. Okay. So I would just send it to Clark. Which is C A. RC. And I think that's it. And then. I would just send it to. You guys. Is there an email or a fax number that. We can send that assessment too. When we do get it. Which would be easier. Fax or email for you. Definitely. Email. Okay. So I would just send it to. Which is C. A. RC. And I think that's it. Okay. So I would just send it to. At. E. O. S. I. S. Recovery. Dot com. Yeah. Your phone actually broke up. Like the first part of that. I didn't get anything before recovery. Dot com. Okay. C. A. R. C. Okay. Add. Which is E. O. S. I. S. Okay. Recovery. Okay. So it's C. Charlie. Alpha. Romeo. Charlie. At. C. O. S. R. C. O. S. C. R. S. I. E. O. S. O. S. C. S. O. S. O. S. O. S. O. O. O. O. O. O. R. S. O. R. C. R. S. O. S. O. T. R. O.

QuickQuest. , Sergeant Craig Harrell. What's up sir? We still have a couple other phone calls to make. I think that's all I have for now. I got the e-mail. As soon as we get that, we'll send it over. Actually, is there a direct line phone number for this intake? It would be the 612. Say it again. It's 612. Yeah. 612. 612. 454. 2014. That would be the admissions team. Okay. All right. Perfect. Thank you. Yes, of course. All right. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Hello. Can you hear me now? Yeah, yep. Okay, cool, cool. Um, oh, I that that fax number that Lacey just shared with me in the group chat. Okay. Are you familiar with where that that fax? Like, is that it at the office? It's Yeah, that's the fax machine at the office. Yep. So if you know, and nobody is there today, it's the holiday. If that helps. Yeah. Nobody's there to check it. Correct. Yeah. No holidays morning. The office is closed. Gotcha. Yeah. What were you trying to get done or accomplish? Well, I'm doing an intake for a gentleman. And on the top of his to do list is to get back into an inpatient or outpatient program that and that ROI and the assessment was just like, we just filled out the ROI from sobriety first. And then she sent over the assessment to the fax. Because we thought that the fastest way we could get it in our hands. Because and yeah, in order for us to get into one of the places, we need to have like that updated assessment. But okay, it sounds like. Okay, so you have like a place that that is willing to accept them and or has a bed, but they needed that. Yeah, well, willing to put them on a waiting list, but they need to see the the new assessment. Okay, and so like, so so we saw it was sent to the office by somebody by a third party. And you're trying to obtain that. Right? Yeah, yeah. Okay, it is. Yeah. And I'm thinking to myself that, you know, since sobriety first is like, just kind of like, I don't know, a mile or two or three away, maybe it'd be faster just to go to that place in person and ask them. For sure. If that's, if that's ever an option, that's, that's what I would go with. And or you can have them send it to you in lieu of that, like, say if you had known ahead of time and or still can, like that, you know, she's not going to be there, you know, the office isn't there. We need to get it done today. Like you could have it sent to you. Right? Like by having an ROI for Generation Hope, you are considered Generation Hope, right? You're an employee. We will when we share data within the company with each other, we're not bound by HIPAA. Right? I mean, I mean, we are like on the outside, but not internally. So right. Yeah, we I did ask her if that was a possibility. And then she said that she wasn't able to because she was working from home and didn't have like access to direct access to like the company email or something like that. I think that's what she said. Okay. And that, I guess, also tracks or makes sense, you know, a lot of, you know, companies, especially like with with with data, right? Like they want to control the access and or want you to use their email or their servers or whatever that will bound to platforms, you know, like for us as prospective, right? Like, or connect teams, you know? Yeah. So sometimes those stars align and sometimes they don't, which can be frustrating. But I mean, at the end of the day, you are trying to take initiative, which is a good thing. But it's like an uphill battle based on the fact that it's a federal holiday. People aren't working, you know? Yeah, that's kind of what I'm realizing a little bit. All right. So I do have one last question on that case. Okay. Um, so sobriety first, the place that did the assessment, they, the ROI that that Eric signed was through percentive. And like, so that was signed and updated for them all good. If they since I know that they're using percent of on their side, since the ROI was signed, is it possible that I can access the assessment through percent of somehow or? So, I mean, to view, yes, you could, but not like to send or to send externally. Gotcha. I want to say we had, we as in you and I had crossed that before, like a month ago when I thought that you would be able to download or export a ROI. And I was mistaken, I guess, only admin can. So at least he had to correct me on that. So like, as far as, you know, that goes, yeah, I mean, you know, I'm not a percent of expert. I just know that, like, you know, we had kind of like, tried to cross that river needed to at some point in the recent memory in that, you know, we weren't able to. So, yeah, I mean, if I, if I was you, I would just, you know, maybe try to do that in person. If you can today, if you have time, and or if they're even open, you know, that is kind of a roll of the dice. But yeah, I got to let you go. I'm trying to run out the door right now. All right. No problem. Thank you for taking my call. I'll talk to you soon. I can't hear you. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for taking my call. I'll talk to you soon. I'm just going to hang up.",

Okay, let's see what's going on here. Okay, yeah, it looks like we just need to do a phone screening with him. And then after that, we should be good at like scheduling. I'm assuming it's for residential or? Yes, yes. I have them with me right now if you... I have them with me right now if you wanna go through the screening process or...

Okay, okay, are you able to climb stairs? Yeah. Do you use any like mobility devices, like a walker or a cane? Sometimes, sometimes I do, because I had like, I had a bad injury in my lower back and stuff, so sometimes I do, and when I go places, I normally use the elevator.

Yeah, one for PTSD, and I was supposed to get my green dot marijuana card through my doctor's interlude, but I never had a chance to go back and finish my doctor's appointment, so I just suffer with PTSD. Okay, and I'm just gonna be totally transparent, medical marijuana is not allowed at our facilities, are you okay with that? Yeah, I'm okay with that. Okay, just, okay, and I'm sorry, I might have already asked you this, so I apologize. Have you recently had surgery? No. Okay, do you have any medical conditions that require 24-7 nursing care? No. Diabetes at all? No. Ever have a heart attack? Yeah, I think I had one. What do you mean by that, like you think you had one, or like you went to the doctor and they told you you had one? Um, I think I just was having a panic attack. I don't think I ever had a heart attack. Okay. And then are you able to complete all activities of daily living? Yep. Okay, and then for mental health, any mental health diagnoses? I know you mentioned depression and PTSD. And anxiety, yep. Okay, okay. And then have you ever heard or seen things that other people don't hear and see? Sometimes when I hallucinate. Is that like outside of drug use, or is that in the context of drug use? Okay, so you only hallucinate with drug use? Yeah. Okay, and then have you ever received treatment for an eating disorder? Um, no, but when I was in Louisiana, I just had double portions. It was good to have double portions. Okay. And then during times of stress, have you ever had thoughts of harming yourself or others? Sometimes, harming others. And did you ever act on those thoughts? Um, yeah, I had attempts and stuff, but other than that, I've been good. I ain't really been acting out too much. Okay, um, so with you acting on those thoughts, like when did that last occur? No, I never really had no actions like that. I just had me like, just thoughts in my head when I never really could fall asleep. Oh, okay, so you haven't, okay. Do you have any history of suicide? No. Oh, I'm sorry? No, I just said I have an attempt that is just not in me to just worry about the next person like that. I just- Right. Okay, I see what you're saying. Are you on probation or parole? Yeah, I'm currently on probation, and yep, that's like for chemical use. I'm just, I'll be off in January, but anytime soon. I've been on it for one year. I'm only on two years of it. She just want me to do treatment, and then I'll be off. Okay, and what county is it through? Ramsey County. And do you know who your PO is by chance? Yeah, her name is Melissa Soto, M-E-L-I-S-S-A, Soto, S-O-T-O. Okay, perfect, and then off the top of your head, off the top of your head, do you have contact information for her? Not a big deal if you don't. I don't have it off the back of my head, but it's what my belongings and stuff. No worries, that's totally fine. Have you ever been convicted of a CSD charge? No. Arson? No. Any active warrants to your knowledge? Nope. Are you on a commitment? Yeah. Okay, did you have a whole court process with that where someone makes your medical decisions and stuff? Yeah, just a court order just to finish treatment and stuff, that's all. But not like, here, you know what I'm gonna look, because it doesn't look like we saw one. Let me see. Do you have an ACT team? I'm gonna finish this while I do this. Do you have an ACT team or CADI waiver? No, I want one. Okay. Are you your own legal guardian? Yeah. Okay, and then do you use any alcohol or GPS monitoring devices? No. Okay, and yeah, in terms of commitment, I don't see one on your background. I mean, I get being ordered to finish treatment, but I don't, it's kind of more of like, you know, like I said, you can't make medical decisions for yourself, so I'd like to. Okay, no. Or like, for example, yeah. Okay, so you want Otsego. And where are you currently located? I'm currently located in St. Cloud at the Place of Hope. Okay, perfect. Actually, that's not bad at all. So you said you want to get in as soon as possible? Yeah, because I don't really want to keep being around these people they're using and they're stressing me out. I'm just trying to get away. Yeah. That's fair. I mean, can we do tomorrow? Yes. And can your, I don't know if he was your counselor, but can he hear me too? I just want to make sure he hears me, so at least he knows. Okay, hold on one second. Otsego. Hold on. Brenda? Hold on one second. Brenda? Mm-hmm. Okay, she just want to speak with you one second. Hold on, here you come. He can hear you. She said tomorrow. Oh, perfect. Okay, yeah, sorry. I just wanted to say we do have a bed for tomorrow, so as long as you guys are okay with that, we could do that if that works. Would I need a ride, would a medical ride? No, we actually have, we got it like, let's see, is it okay if our driver leaves at 1130 to get there around like 1230, 1216-ish? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Perfect. Is that through the Place of Hope or here? Yeah, is it, oh, I'm sorry. Pick up from the Place of Hope or? Well, it's your preference. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, we can pick up there. Oh, sorry, you asking him? I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry. Yeah, I was asking him like whether he wanted to get picked up at the office here or at the Place of Hope, but the Place of Hope is probably gonna be the better place. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. And I just want to make sure I have the correct address. Is it 511 9th Avenue North? Okay, just want to make sure. And then, let's see that. I'm just trying to see. And then what's a good number to call to like confirm? Well, he doesn't have an active cell phone right now, but I can give you my phone number and I can confirm, like make sure he's alive and at where he is supposed to be. Are you ready? Okay, yeah, what's that? It's 320-775-9130. Perfect, so 320-775-9130? Yep. Perfect, all right. Well, then I got that all set up then for tomorrow. Actually, you know what? I'm looking at the wrong date. Okay, sorry, can I do it earlier in the morning? Like where I have a driver actually leave and get there at 8.30 in the morning? I'm sorry, I was looking at the wrong day. I was looking at today. Yeah, yeah, that's fine. I'm also gonna put it in. Otherwise, yeah, I can try and look and see if I've got a different driver who's got, let me look and see if I have a different driver who's later, I just don't want to. Where is he? Where is he? Okay, they're booked up, booked up. Okay, yeah, so unfortunately, he is the only driver available. And so actually what would happen is he would leave tomorrow at like around 8 a.m., probably get there at like, you know, give or take, 8.30, 8.45-ish, is that okay? Yeah. Okay. I apologize, I'm so sorry, I was looking at the wrong date. No, you're totally fine. And so yeah, he'll leave and his name's Dustin. And so yeah, he's all set up then. Pick him up and then we'll get back to you. Okay, thank you. Thank you. And then pick him up and then we'll get him. Oh, yep. And then could I get a phone number for you guys just in case like there's any questions or something? Okay, yeah, let me know when. I'm ready. You're ready. Yeah. 952. Okay. Oh, sorry. My bad, I'm sorry. 297. Don't worry. 8665. Okay. All right, so you said 952-297-8665? That's correct. Okay. All right. And so 8.45, he'll be at Place of Hope, Dustin. And, okay. Do you want his phone number as well, just in case? Sure. If I can give you his phone number as well. Yeah, let me know when you're ready for his phone number. Go ahead. Oh, 763-600-1265. 1265, Dustin Driver. And when they, is he going to be in like a personal vehicle or like a van or what's? Yeah, it's probably going to be either a Ford Escape. It's like one of those like smaller Ford SUVs. It's either, yeah, I think it's a Ford Escape. But yeah, he will definitely call because we'll also call tomorrow to confirm. But it should be all good to go. I will say, and I just want to make sure Eric's aware of this, that kind of like what we've been doing is how we do it is we have all of our people go to Eden Prairie first just to get medically cleared. And then once they're at that facility and they're medically cleared, we get them to where they're going. So like, for example, he's going to be at Sego. So as long as he's medically cleared by our nurses tomorrow, he will go to Sego tomorrow as well. All right, I understand. Yeah, so I just, I wanted to make him aware. So it's not like, oh my gosh, where am I going? What's happening? And then you got, I don't know if you guys actually went over this already, but do you guys have a 30 day program or 60, 90 inpatient program? What do you, does he already know what he's signing up for? Yeah, I mean, so our program is 30 to 45 days. Oh yeah, cool, cool, cool. All right. Yep, and so, is there any other questions? Cause I mean, just for dual diagnostics, so focused on both mental health and chemical dependency and then he'll get a counselor for each. So just kind of some tips. You guys got it all taken care of. And let's see, is there an ROI that you guys can send to my organizations so I can, we can like communicate with you guys and for continuing care purposes? Yeah, well, yeah, if you want, cause do you guys have ROI there or do you want, I mean, you can print out one of ours. We have one on our website. Otherwise if you just use one of yours and have them sign down and just fax it to us, that should work. Okay, that sounds like something my supervisor can figure out, but yes, that's something. Yeah, let me see it. Otherwise we, on our website, I will tell you, it is under resources and it's under client forms and literally it does release of information. So, and there's an online form that you can fill out, so just a heads up. Okay, and then I didn't, I'm sorry, I didn't get your name either. Oh, it's Juliana. Juliana, cool, awesome. Well, then I think I have, so I guess we're confirmed for tomorrow at 8.45 AM. If we have any questions or concerns, we'll reach out to Dustin and also feel free to give him my phone number and- Oh yeah, I put your phone number on the appointment so he'll be able to see it as well. So you guys, like I said, he'll probably call you tomorrow because not only do we call, but they also call because they don't want to be driving somewhere, things aren't confirmed. So just expect some phone calls tomorrow morning. Okay. Thank you. Awesome, all right, thank you. Absolutely, and if any other questions arise, please, please, please do not hesitate to reach out as we just want him to be as comfortable as possible coming in. For sure, thank you. Thank you for helping us out with this. It's awesome. Absolutely. But yeah, well, you guys have a good rest of your day and yeah, we'll be seeing you tomorrow. All right, thank you. You too. All right, bye. Yep.",

It was good. Mom picked me up from Amira's and I, I spent the night, I like spent like two nights at her house and that was really fun. That's cool. And Amira's the girl that lives in Rochester? No, she's in Ramsey. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's cool. I'm glad you were able to meet up with your, your friend. Yeah, me too. It was my first time seeing her in a long, long time. Yeah, I should probably tell you right away that my phone just got done like malfunctioning a bunch and yeah, so I would have called you probably 10 minutes ago, but it was like restarting and like shutting off and restarting and, and yeah, actually the person I was on the phone with, I got hung up on because the phone just started malfunctioning like that. But it was meant to be because I intended on giving you a call on my ride on my way on my way back home. Yeah. Yeah. But if, if it makes you feel any better, I could share something private about the person that I just got off the phone with. What is it? Okay. Well, I can't tell you who this happened to, but the person I just got off the phone with and was currently and the fetal position crying because you had walked into her boyfriend doing some, something adulterous with the person that she's been staying with for like the last six months. She caught her boyfriend cheating with like basically her best friend. Yeah. And then they were like just denying everything. Oh my gosh. Normally I wouldn't tell you, share something like that, but I guess hearing stuff like what other people are going through kind of sometimes, not that like, like sucks for them or anything like that, but I don't know, suddenly, would you rather be experiencing negative seven degree weather or walking in on your boyfriend cheating on you with, I don't know. Definitely the weather. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I, earlier I was thinking I had a pretty bad attitude about the weather, but now I'm thinking to myself, yeah, the weather's not so bad. Yeah. Yeah. My room is really cold right now and I'm too lazy to get up and turn the heater on. Yeah. So you're back in Rochester, mom picked you up? Yeah, but she had to leave like right away so she could go to work. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, was mom able to sit down with you and help you catch up on any of your homework this week? What do you mean? Well, I had talked with her earlier this week and asked her to sit down with you and so she could help you get caught up on a couple of your late assignments. I don't know, she said that she didn't have very many opportunities this week to do that, but she was going to try. Oh. Um. Well, how is school going? Well, I don't know. Actually, do you? I'm sorry. I haven't talked to you in a while, so naturally I want to like hear about everything that's going on in your life, but to be respectful. Uh. You wanted to talk about something specific right away? Kind of, yeah. Okay. Well. Yeah, by all means, let's we could skip to that and then circle back to the rest of it. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so you asked me why you haven't gotten an apology yet. Yeah. Um. Why? Well, just out of curiosity, you are part of the group chat, right? No. The family group text thing. I'm pretty sure I'm not. Okay. I'll have to look into that, I guess. Well, I did post. I did like type of response. To is what I would label as my apology. And that group family chat. Yeah. I heard about that, but that was also a I said. Well, I don't understand what's why you guys are pointing out that it's AI. Trust me, the AI version is a lot easier to digest than what. My words came out with to begin with, you know. Does that make sense? Not really. And so I guess what I'm trying to say is like I my words. Brandon Gillis's words, dad's words, like I try my best sometimes to like articulate. And like put words together in a way that they. It's like they achieve the what I'm trying to get at, but. Because of like my like sometimes with emotion and I don't know in the moment, everything that's going on, like I will tend to not be able to say it properly. So. I enlisted the help of my proofread aka Gemini. Yeah, I don't understand why that's a big deal. It's not like I. It's not genuine or it doesn't mean like the same thing. And I guess I don't know if you. Legitimately asking me like why I would need Gemini to do that and I couldn't just say whatever I got. Are you asking me? Kind of. Yeah. Well, the truth. Well, where are you going to hold the truth against me? I don't think so. I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know. Oh, OK. All right. Well, I'm going to. Well, if I tell you the truth, I hope that it doesn't get held against me. But the truth is like that my feelings are also like invested into this disagreement and this whole situation. And I. My perspective and my perspective, I feel like I also deserve an apology, but honestly, when it comes to like my role as a parent, whether I get that apology or not, is not as important as us moving forward. So, yes, I would like an apology, but that's. Not. Yeah, I'm probably not going to get one. And the way I was originally using my words. Does that make sense? That's why I proof I use my proofread. I mean, kind of. I'm just like kind of confused and like what you want us to apologize for. Well, I guess if you could take from my perspective, like I. Me. I'm the concerned and loving parent. On my on my mind from the day that the time that I wake up in the morning until the end of the time that I go to bed at night. And. I, like, wonder, like, how things are going with school and how things are going with your friends and like if there's anything that you're going through right now. I'm not there to be a part of or there to help you with and. And I feel kind of powerless. And I want like. I don't know. Yeah. So I guess I'm. Things have been going. And when I do see you on Sunday. It's going to be like, I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you. And. I'm going to miss you, too. And. And. I'm going to miss you. In that way, things have been going. And when I do see you on Sunday. I understand that. There was like always a lot to. Emotion and a lot of thoughts that get packed into those visits because. It's not just me or visiting with it's also brothers and Gabby and. You know, trying to. I don't know. They can be like overstimulating, but. My point is, is like I. Yeah, when I when I go there. I. Despite like the commotion like I want to be able to connect with you guys and I want you guys to know that I'm like. Like here for you and I love you and I'm like, I don't know. And. You guys were like clearly kind of angry at the actions of the the adults like you were under the impression that we were all drinking and I wasn't drinking and. Aside from like a couple of sips out of a cup Gabby wasn't drinking. Well, you guys thought that I was. And that's. I don't know. And then when you guys felt like you mentioned that. Like you feel like you guys didn't. We're coming in like second best like I wanted to make it clear that like you guys are my, my primary people that I wanted to visit with. And I do anything to kind of clear the area and make it so we could all hang out and that's what was going on in my mind and I sent everybody away. And I don't know I just wanted you guys to be like happy and hang out with me. And you guys were like super, super crabby. And. I don't know. I guess I just got feelings hurt and said some stupid shit. Yeah, but like, even, even like then, even that you weren't drinking I was just like I just feel like like you, like all of the adults were really just like hanging out with each other and like just like really weren't hanging out with us. But I just kind of feel like that you guys are really only hanging out with each other. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I just kind of feel like that you guys are really only hanging out with each other. If I were to have left with those guys and like, left you guys to babysit the boys. I could see you guys saying that in that case, but no, I legitimately wanted to spend time with you guys and I wanted to bring the boys out there and trust me, I didn't drive three hours out there to see, to hang out with Gabby, Corey, and Kiana. Yeah, but even then, I feel like just like, really not like, when they like, when they wanted an apology for it, it was like, just the things that were like said in the argument. Absolutely. Yeah. I definitely wish we would have not said that because I, yeah, that was definitely not appropriate or accurate and if I were to ask myself why did I say that, it was coming from a place of neglect and I think that, yeah, I don't want you to think that there's any excuse for me to like, talk to you guys like that because, yeah, that's not okay. You know, I love you guys and you guys deserve respect. Yeah. Well, I appreciate that, Ad. And I love you guys and honestly, I do love you. When I make a mistake, I want you guys to know that I am not, I am an adult enough to admit when I am wrong and as much as like, as much, as fun as it would be to be like, maybe act like my mom would and be like, nah, that's on you, fuck that, blah, blah, and just kind of deflect just so that I don't have to like, be humble. I don't know. I don't think that, I think it's just be nice if you guys got the respect you deserve. Yeah. And likewise, I mean, because as a parent, there's quite a few times that I like, demand respect from you guys like, when it's like, this is your punishment or I want you to do this and even though you don't want to do it, I got to make you guys do a lot of things that you guys don't want to do, unfortunately. And I understand that you guys wouldn't do those things if you didn't respect me. So, it's like a, it's a two-way street, like, I love you guys and I only want what's best for you. Yeah. Well, I really appreciate, I really appreciate you apologizing, Dad. It means a lot. Yeah. Well, you mean a lot to me. I don't know. I really do. I mean that. I fucking think about you guys all the time. I don't know. This whole, I don't know, I've got like, lots of complaints about the way things are right now. Like, I feel like when you guys were staying with me and Mom was not seeing you guys very often, I feel like I made a lot more effort to communicate with her about things that were going on with you guys. And I feel like she does not reciprocate that for some silly reason. Yeah. Yeah. I get, like, where you're coming from, and I kind of agree. Because, like, when we were living with you, I did notice how much you were, like, trying to, like, talk to her about, like, us and stuff. But, yeah, I understand. Yeah. And I try to make sure that everything is, like, cool between her and I. Like, there's no, like, I don't know, there's no issues. And according to her, she says that there aren't any issues. So, I don't know. Oh, I guess we'll have to, me and her will have to figure out. I miss you. I miss you, too. You want to hear... Sorry, Gabby was clicking in. You want me to add Gabby to the call? Sure. Okay. All right. One second. Okay. Hello. I got a three-way call. Hold on a second. Hello? Hello? Hey, how are you? I'm good. I'm fine. I just want to let you know that I'm at the office. I'm on the phone with Gabby. I'm on the phone with Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Hello? Gabby, are you there? Oh, shit. Hold on a second. Merge. There we are. Is everybody here? Ow! Ow! Ow! Is that Alex? Yeah, it sounds like Alex. Yeah, Alex is next to me. Hey, Gabby. Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Gabby? Sorry, I seen you were calling just a second ago and I was on the phone with Ask. Oh. So that – What is it? The shelf that you pulled out earlier to put back in the shower, I'm assuming. It had a toothbrush in it. What did you do with that? Threw it away. If it's important you could pull it out of the trash can. Yeah, right. No, luckily there's a couple new toothbrushes, but it was my mom's toothbrush. There is no way in hell that was your mom's toothbrush, bro. It was. She just asked me. She put her toothbrush in that nasty under-the-sink tray? Yeah, I guess. Oh, wow. That's crazy. Oh, yeah. New toothbrush. That one looked very foul. Yeah. Yeah, well, she used a new one. When you get into town, can you just pull up to the front? I need to go to Quick Trip to deposit money. Absolutely. Do you – You know that Ashton's on the phone, right? Mm-hmm. And? Say, what up, girl? How was your weekend? Are you still at Amira's? No, you're probably home now. Yeah, I'm home. I guess. If he wants to go run out there. I'm sorry, you had fun at Amira's? Stop! All right, well, I just had those kind of questions. I love you, Ashton. I don't know. There's a lot going on here, and I don't want to ruin your guys' conversation, whatever you guys were having. Okay, I love you. Love you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay, I think Gabby just hangs up, and then naturally this turns into just a you and me conversation again. Yeah. It's so cold in my room, but I really don't want to get up. Yeah. In my head, I don't ever really do anything. I think mom just got home, I think. Yeah. Hey. Hey. Hey, if I were to... Remember me talking to you about the whole social media thing a little bit ago? Social media thing? Yeah, did I tell you about me getting back on social media? You did not. Um, yeah, so I'm making it a point to get back into social media. Why? Oh, like about the YouTube thing? Well, the YouTube thing, yes. But then also, like, Facebook and, um... Yeah, Facebook. Yeah, but the thing is, like, I don't want to be the... I just don't want to post things on Facebook. So, like, it's typically, like, Gemini that does most of, like, the what to say, how to make it look sort of thing. Yeah. Is any of that interest to you? Yeah, I think it would be cool for, like, why do you plan to, like, start doing social media? So I can basically build a brand, like a persona. Like, I have, like, an image that I want to portray. But yet the real brand and real life brand actually lacks the interest to actually do that. Like, I lack the interest and I don't actually see the value in, like, doing it myself or putting my legitimate feelings or thoughts out there. So I just want to put stuff out there that is, like, uh, that grabs people's attention, builds followers, I don't know, portrays... Imagine by the time you're, like, 45, you're gonna be like Bill Gates. I could. Well, so I mean, I guess I'm doing this for a couple of different reasons. But I really don't have the expertise that perhaps you guys would. So I was gonna ask if I could get you to help me in any way that you are interested in helping. Like, for example, I wanted to post... My last post I was going to put together was, like, a slideshow and, like, a thing that was kind of celebrating Alex and his potty training. Yeah, you guys are starting to potty train him? Yeah, I started to potty train him. He's actually doing, like, really, really well. It's just I basically have to potty train the adults now because they don't understand how this fucking whole potty training thing works. Yeah. He knows how to use the toilet now? Yep, yeah. Like, if I were to go, basically, he wears regular underwear. And then, yeah, he wears regular underwear. And then he goes to the bathroom in the potty, like, totally like normal. He has actually has not had a single accident while wearing those regular underwears yet. He's growing up. I know, that's what I'm saying. I'm super proud of him. He's still my baby. So, Gabby was telling me that, like, the, like, the fucking, the post that I'm trying to create is actually easily created on Instagram. And I was just gonna maybe, I'm not really on Instagram. Like, I have to totally, like, log into it and all that bullshit. If I were to send you the pictures and, like, tell you the song that I wanted to play in the background, could you create it? And then, like, send it back to me somehow? Like, you said create the song? What? I'm confused what you're asking me to do. So, there's basically, like, a set of pictures. Right? Like a slideshow. And then, uh, and then a background song to play, like, as the slideshow goes from front to back. So, you want me to, like, create, like, a video? So, you're asking me to, like, make, like, pictures, but, like, make it into a video with the music in the background? Yeah. Yeah, it's like a slideshow with the music in the background. And I guess you can do it really easily on Instagram. Yeah, I can do that. Okay. Awesome. Alright, so I can tell you the song, and then I'll tell you the song in a text message, and I'll share the photos with you on Google Photos. Okie dokie. Yeah? Yeah. And then... That sounds like a fun little side activity. Dude, that'd be so fuckin' awesome if you could do that. That'd be fuckin' awesome. Yeah, I can try. Pretty sure I can do that. I am running into this fuckin' Dollar General place right now. Well, I'm pretty sure Mom just got home, so... I'm gonna let you go, but I love you so much. Alright, I love you too. Alright, I'll talk to you soon, okay? Alright, send me the pictures and, like, what song, and I'll do that for you. Okay, I'll send it to you. Bye tonight. Okay, bye, love you. Bye.",

I just realized that some of my texts that were going out were not something I would want my grandmother reading. Fuck your grandma. Right, it's an expression, but yeah, I can... Fuck your grandma. Yeah, I also don't like old people. She's hanging out with me. Me and you, huh? She's coming out right now. That's a random white dude with no hair. I thought that random dude was gay. Rock your car, bro. That dude's got a gun. He's white. She's coming out right now with the thing. What are we doing? I have to write some reports, bro. I am so sorry. Can we meet up in the morning, though? That's responsibility, bro. I know. You don't have to be sorry. Not like you'd be pulling up at my house. I'd pull up at your fucking house, bro. I'm a savage. Good for you, bro. You got to make the choices you got to make, especially with one of you with a job right now. Yeah, so you did hear. You did hear. Okay, I understand. So I'm glad you heard that part. What was it about Gabby with the bump? What, she's got a bump for me? Yeah, but it's not the short-term stuff, if you know what I'm saying. So is she on that now? No, it's mine. Oh, she's just got it for me. She ain't doing it. That's a conversation. You'll have to have a conversation with her. Yeah, I got you. I got you. Okay. I already told her earlier. That's why she was on my ass for being drunk. She's like, shut up. Let me talk. That's why she's being rude. That makes sense. Yeah, I can't speak for Gabby. She'll talk to you and tell you everything. She's comfortable. Is it just you out there, by the way, or do you have somebody else? Oh, okay, your homeboy. Hey, what's up? Hey, he's still here and he's still safe. I'm glad to hear that. Your wingman is still here. I know. Dude, I shot pool with him today, dude. He doesn't even know how to rack a fucking rack of balls. No, I won money on you, dude. I won 20 bucks on you in pool. You're a piece of shit. I hate this guy right now. I almost punched him multiple times this weekend, dude. Like the last weekend I hung out with him when you were there, dude. He had a good time and I hadn't seen him in for a while. I brought him back the weekend after, dude. Dude's fucking on my breakfast, making a mess, doing this, doing that, fucking cheating me left and right, disrespecting me. I fucking hate this nigga. Right now? Yeah. But at the end of the day, even when I get aggressive and mean with him, 15 minutes later, I break it down. I break it down with you for real. And I'm like, you know what? I think we've just been spending too much time together. You know what? I still love you. I still fucking love you. I've known you since I was like 12. You're still my boy. But he thinks he went to prison. So he thinks he's right. He's got like this stubborn attitude. He's like, yeah, I'm always fucking right. I'm like, no, bro. I'm like, you know how disrespectful it is for you to fucking tell me when I'm trying to teach you something? I'm trying to teach you something, bro. And you're just like, you have no regard to learn it because you're just being disrespectful and you think you're already right. Like that hurts my feelings. Right? We all have feelings. Right. It does make sense. I'm not going to hang out with him for at least another month. I'll see you next month. Where's Gabby? What about $200? You didn't win $200. No. Oh, on the poll tab. Now all says he wants to tell you he won $200 on a poll tab that he would have never bought if I didn't tell him to buy it. Oh, so he's taking all the credit. Like he's like, yeah, he's the rabbit's foot now. We went to the bowling alley to shoot some pool. That's why I almost beat him up with a pool stick. But now it's like, you know what? I know these people here would support me because he's black, but he's my friend and you can't hit your friends with pool sticks, even when you really fucking want to hit him with food sticks. And at that point, then he ended up being done with pool. I beat him in pool so many times. I made $20 off of him. And then I put that $20 in. We both threw $20 in. Basically both his whole $40, both the $200. Where's Gabby? Does she not even fucking care about me? She's coming out right this second. She's walking through the house towards the door. You should see her in about 35 seconds tops. Oh, we're at my house. So I don't think we're going to see her. You drove all the way back to your place. No, we didn't. We've been sitting here fucking thinking about things. Oh, you didn't actually come to the, come here. All right. I'm going to see her in a second. Okay. I'll see you. I hope she brings me something special. Okay. All right. I hope you come out too. I'll see you. Bye.",

They said he already gave him permission, but I really appreciate the I'm just kidding. I mean, she's not into it. She's so fucking into you, but I have been hitting on her all fucking night, bro. Not to mean a lot. I'm drunk as fuck. I like I like your style. I've been in there. I've been like, we were playing darts and I'm like, I get a double bullseye. I said, if I get a bullseye, you gotta, you gotta kiss me for one second. If I get a double bullseye, you gotta kiss me for three seconds. I'm not going to darts. Let's come. Yeah. But yeah, I've been in an hour. Still at a depot. Fuck my ATM card ain't working. Yeah. I was actually going to give you a call. I tried calling you guys just a few minutes ago, but I couldn't get through. Yeah. I just saw your call. Yeah. So I just wanted to kind of, are you guys going to be cool for the night? Are you guys, are you guys leaving town tonight or no? Yeah. Leaving Gabby and about all that shit. You should know that. Okay. I just wanted to make sure. Cause yeah, I'd give that person a heads up before you guys just go crazy, go all the way down or whatever. But it's, if you guys are good then, uh, yeah. Oh, tell her, tell her as to if, uh, fuck, nevermind. Uh, uh, yeah, nevermind. Okay. Well, you guys, as long as you guys are having a good time, just show, uh, you, you didn't like, uh, salt your, your, your fucking wingman. Did you? Yo, yo, yo. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, I had another call. Yeah. I can hear you. I had another call. Oh, but, uh, yeah. Me and you going, I'm not going over Gabby, right? She was already talking about, I told her I like you in, I'm not, I'm thinking about your offer, bro. I'm thinking I want to, I think I'm thinking I want to have kids with all the ones you have kids with and the ones you ain't have kids with you guys. We're going to have kids with them together. I'm thinking about it. I've been drinking a lot. I want to have kids with all the ones you have kids with. I want kids true though. You can't have all of them, bro. Yeah. Sure. Thanksgiving. Yeah. And then if they hit us on child support, bro, we're going to transition money back and forth. Like they ain't going to get shit. And these chicks don't know what child support is. No, no. And Gabby are playing pool now or playing darts. Y'all playing without me now. All right, cool. I guess now we'll find out. All right. Make sure you take at least one picture to like try to catch the vibe. All right. All right. I'll talk to you soon. What's up with your kids brother sleep? Right? No, they're not. They're still fucking awake and very fucking like annoying and while I'm trying to work, I didn't say don't drown them. I didn't say that wasn't the right word, but don't don't drown them. Even if they don't drown your kids. I told him that I've been hitting on you. Hello. I told him that me, you and his girlfriend, you're all going to be at them. My phone, my portable charger. Oh my God. Zach keeps trying to kiss me. Yeah. He was like, if I get a bullseye, you have to get me a three second kiss or whatever it was. Five seconds. This didn't happen. I mean, what if you were bowling? Like what? Go Brandon. What? That's literally. And you know what the funny part is? They started a game of darts without me. That's almost as disrespectful as she was last time that I came and picked you up and she was super rude to me. Like she has, she wants nothing to do with you. Does she talk to you about that at all? Or is she like, no, she was, did she like explain to you that she was like, I don't know, drunk. I'm going to tell you right now, the fact that she smoked a little bit, she has too much confidence and she is not taking any shit. Really? Really? I mean, I made a deal with her on the bullseyes with the kisses and I couldn't hit. I was being all, you know, like, Hey, Hey, no, I came in hot. It was before I was like, obviously drunk. And I played it. I hit it with swag. Now at this point, dude, if I hit a bullseye, dude, I'd kiss my buddy. Now. All right, bro. I'm going to drop her out. All right. Work tomorrow again. Gosh, you already told me that, man. I always forget about you. Sorry. You guys went out tonight? Have you guys fucking, are you guys up there? Are you guys fucking the ATM? I was on the phone with you. I'm trying. It's Brandon. You know, I don't hit one unless I went to bro. I hit a 200, like five hours ago. Other than that, I only get money when I'm with you. That is very, very kind of you to, to leave me to believe that I'm your winner. You are the fucking winner. You know, I can't believe you sent me with Gabby. She just, she don't even want to play. It's even like redeeming herself. Like even a little bit. It's basically a Chilean girl and an Ethiopian boy. Give me up on me. Or do you feel like, you feel like there was imminent threat that ice is going to like come through that door in any moment? I hope they do. Then I'm going to hang out with you and say, Gabby, don't do this to me again. No, what's on and put them bitches to sleep. Good night. All right. I'll talk to you in a little bit.",

I did not do that shit, bro. At all. Why? Fentanyl is really dangerous, man. I used to do heroin, but, and I did fentanyl, I dabbled in fentanyl for a while, but I don't, no, I have no desire to do that shit. No, no judgment if you do or whatever. I didn't, bro.

I don't think that you meant it last night, but it sounded like you guys were just saying like recently within like the last couple of weeks or something. Well, I don't even remember saying that.

Yeah, you don't need insurance. What is that? So then what? You wouldn't... I'm not doing all that, bro. I don't need help. I mean, I do, but... I... I ain't doing all that, buddy.

And then also, did you say that – I remember you saying that I should look into – or I should make sure that they did the ROI for Sobriety Fix correctly? Yeah. What was it about that you think they got wrong, I suppose? Well, I don't know, because Partners said that they didn't receive it, but I called Sobriety first, and then they're like, we'll send it over right away. And then they're like, we'll send it over again. And then I don't know if they have like a – I don't know if they have – because when they faxed them over, I don't know if they haven't looked through their – what is it called? Yeah, fax or whatever. Yeah, fax folder or whatever the hell. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let's see. So, actually, I know – so I think when we sat down, I scheduled you for a Partners appointment, but when we went to Sobriety first, that was like a whole different organization. So, yeah, if we were to talk to Partners now about your assessment, they would be like, well, we haven't done it yet. But, yeah, I think we should give Sobriety first a call, like a three-way call, and just let them know, because there's a fax number that they're supposed to send it to. And then it'd be probably a good time to check if the ROI was filled out correctly. Yeah, I – yeah, they said that – I mean, they gave me the number, the fax number, and then I called them back, and it was all verified that the number was correct. It was sent to Generation Hope? This was to – from Sobriety first to Partners Behavioral. I signed up on both ROIs for both of them. Okay. Yeah, I understand. So, Partners has just been calling me freaking like every day, and they're like, oh, you know, did you get this done and all that? I'm like, it's all done, and you guys should have everything. So, what did the assessment say? Like, I'm curious, because – so, yeah, yeah, what did it say? Did it just say – It should be, like, for outpatient. Okay. And then – Like, it was, like, the grade is, like, 2.5 or, like, 2.1 or whatever the hell. Okay. And I told them, I reiterated, I was like, I need a place to go, though, so I need, like, an outpatient, like, with lodging type of deal. Yeah, and they give you some recommendations? Yeah, Partners gave me here in town – What was it? I'll have to look that up. Hold on. Yeah, change place. Oh, okay, change place. Yeah. Because that's, like – Huh? Sorry. That's, like, three days a week, right? I'm not sure. Okay. So, I'm looking at my – my office lady is telling me – Yeah, so, basically, yeah, check your email and – and that – yeah, we have to do an additional ROI because – for Generation Hope because they – we don't have one for us yet, I guess. Okay. Yeah, do you want to do – just call them or what? I don't know if – a three-way call? I had to talk to them, like, three times yesterday, even though it was MLK Day. Yeah. Don't matter. We can do a three-way. Okay. Okay. One second. One second. Okay. All right. You there? Yep. Hopefully, we get a person on the phone. Wait a second. This is hard noise. Dude, I'm supposed to be calling Sobriety first. I got to – I got to hang up and call the other place.",

    "transcript": "Other calls: Janel McCarter @ 1m 2s Conference call @ 1m 2s Hello, this is Brandon. Hi, Brandon. This is Lori Ligre calling from the St. Cloud HRA. You had left me a message more than a week ago. I was out of the office. You had questions about the process with regard to vouchers. You said other agency questions, so I'm returning your phone call. Yeah, yeah. Well, thank you for giving me a call back. Could I actually, I'm going to add somebody to the call. Is that okay with you? Sure. All right. One second. The subscriber you are trying to reach is not available. Okay. Are you still there? Yep. Okay. I couldn't reach the Janelle who was with me when I made that call, but yeah, I do have some questions so I can try to understand better, because I've applied for other people and other counties, and I see that you guys just do it a little bit differently. So I helped Janelle McCarter do the application, and it says that it was submitted and she was approved, and then we put ourselves on the waiting list for a couple different properties that were on the website, as well as the BIH program. And I guess we're just kind of wondering next steps, I guess. So do we, are we clear to like start looking for other places that aren't on the website or yeah, I guess, how does this work with you guys? Well, those are applications to be placed on the waiting list. That doesn't mean that you're receiving assistance or that there's a unit available. So when your name reaches the top of the waiting list, then we will contact you to update your application and go through the next steps with you at that time. Okay. And those are the, and the only places that are available to go on a waiting list is right there on the website. Is that right? Correct. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. And is this, this program is different than actually having like an HRA voucher or is the voucher basically only like once you are in a place in Annalise, is that when you have like are given a voucher? Are you talking about the Section 8 voucher program versus the Bring It Home program? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So the Section 8 voucher program, that waiting list is closed. Okay. So you didn't apply for that recently. The Bring It Home program is totally separate from that. It's a state funded voucher program, but they work very similar to each other. Okay. But they're two separate programs. I see. Okay. Well, I think that that probably answers all my questions then for now. And oh, actually, so there was something I heard about her, Janelle, having a referral sent over from like a caseworker, something about her being homeless, is there like an email or something like that, where this could be sent or is that just goes straight to you guys? We don't really take referrals like that. I'm not sure what she was talking about. Right. Okay. Okay. I will probably meet with Janelle soon and kind of have more questions that I don't have her with me right now. So and I don't have my notes. I'm kind of paraphrasing. Sure. Okay. Well, thank you for your time. And I'll give you a call back or email you guys if we have any questions. Okay. All right. Thank you. Yep. Thanks. Bye. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello, this is Brandon. Hello, Brandon. This is Aaron at the ready 1st. I am returning your phone call regarding Matthew Marcella. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I, um. Uh, was just going to touch base with you again. My intake lady, uh. I wanted to make sure that, um, I don't know. Actually, let me just confirm 1 last time that she hasn't received. The assessment. It does say it was sent and that it was received. At about 2 PM yesterday, and we're talking about generation hope, right? Not not partners. Yeah. Yeah, so generation home 61223004001. Silence. Silence. Silence. Silence. Okay, let's see. I just kind of wait for a response on that. And I'm Eric Wilson. We already did an ROI for him, correct? Yes, you sent that to me yesterday, I believe, and I had forwarded on a request for him to be able to come into group with us, but they have requested that he complete some sort of inpatient treatment first. Right. Yeah, we, he actually, we did find an inpatient program for him. One of the things that you guys recommended was North Shore, North Lights? North Star, maybe? North Star, that's what it is, yeah. Out of Otsego. Yeah, they came all the way up and picked him up about an hour ago, hour and a half ago. Awesome. Yeah, that is really great news, actually. Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm glad. Okay, so then that is, and I know he had gone, what was the one before that that didn't work out for him? Where was that? Eosis. Eosis, okay, and was there a reason that that didn't fly for him? I just want to know, like, if there is. I think he, I'm going to paraphrase what he said, but I'm pretty sure that he said that he felt that there was other people that in the program that were using, and there was a danger for him to, in his sobriety, to stay there, so he voluntarily left. Okay, and that is okay. I just needed to, for me, like, if I'm going to send people somewhere, I want to know what we're looking at, right? I need to know. For me, I want to be able to refer them to where they're going to get the help they need, not issues. Not true. Right, I totally understand. Yeah. Okay, well, and yeah, he did make it to that transportation this morning. They picked him up at Place of Hope, and, but I, we actually had two individuals with the same first and last name come in yesterday, but luckily one was already onboarded already, but yeah, I was just kind of coordinating with my intake lady about Eric Wilson and making sure that we have his assessment. Yeah, yeah, you did send it over, huh? Okay, okay, and I got a confirmation too. Okay, okay, I think that's all that I needed for now then. Okay, if you, if you find that something's missing or you need something else, feel free to give us a call back, and I'll send whatever else you need over, okay? So, I actually was going to ask you, so you guys do walk-ins on Friday, of course. Do you guys take appointments over the phone at all, like, how do you, throughout the rest of the week, or? So, on Wednesdays is also the format of walk-in. It's different. It's done online, so you can utilize our website and have them do, like, a telehealth. We don't do a phone at all, no phone assessments, but we do the telehealth on Wednesdays walk-in style. So, it's the same kind of format as Friday, but it's not in person, and then Fridays is in person in our St. Cloud office. So, if you know of somebody that, like, comes in on a Wednesday, but we don't, typically, I don't schedule any assessments at all unless they are, like, someone who is either over the road and very difficult, and we need to schedule them an appointment, or have, like, works night and needs to have an appointment so that they can make it to the whatever, or, you know what I mean, that kind of thing. Otherwise, it's just a walk-in format, both Wednesday and Friday. Okay, that is actually extremely helpful, because, yeah, the other third party that we go through for assessments is, like, I don't, I'm not really familiar with their process, but getting back in touch with them and getting them in touch with the people I refer to them is kind of not working out in my, so, yeah. It's not working the way you thought it wanted, or the way you wanted it to. Right, right, like, when I register somebody and I onboard them on my desk, I'd like to see, like, that they, that the third party place gets in contact with them, or I at least know how to bridge that gap, so it's not just, like, right, but if I know Wednesdays is, I can, I can schedule online, or I just apply online on Wednesday from certain time to certain time. You would just, yep, from 9 to 2 is the, is the walk-in, and then if you're, I would recommend for you, like, so that you could bridge the gap that you have, it would be, like, you taking the client, quote, unquote, taking the client, right, so you would walk on to the online, so you'd go online to our website, sobrietyfirstllc.com, and I will repeat that if you need me to, and then on our front screen there, there's, oh, it says, it says schedule an assessment, ignore that button, I hate that button, and then the second one down is a walk-in, it says walk-in assessment, that's the one that you're going to click with your client present, and then from there, it's going to take you right into our Zoom link, and into, like, asking for a asking for a client name, and then joining the meeting, and having that person connect with our CPRS that takes the information, does the release of information, does those kinds of things, so that's where you would mention that, A, you want to be listed, you know what I mean, as a release of information for, for Generation Hope, and then that person would be forwarded onto our assessment, our assessor after that, there isn't a time, quote-unquote, like, I can't say, okay, if you go on at 10 o'clock, Brandon, you're going to get this person in, I can't say that, because it's still just that walk-in format, but you can certainly take them, or guide them there, does that make sense? Absolutely, dude, that is so helpful, and, and I'm also terrible with names, but so I'm going to save your name this time, but what did you say your name was again? Aaron. Oh, oh, I already saved your name, okay. It's okay, I get it. Well, thank you, Aaron, and that is actually super, super helpful. Sure, if you have any questions, concerns. Okay, I probably will be doing that on Wednesday. I do have another call coming in, so I will have to do this with you again later. No problem, have a good day. All right, you too. All right, thank you.",

If you say that it's a good idea for her to go, then I can have her mom pick her up. Okay, yeah. She's complaining. Does she have a history of migraines? She's complaining of a headache and feeling nauseous. Yeah, yeah, she has had it in the past, and we've had to bring medicine to have you hang on to, basically. Okay, yeah. So yeah, that's what's going on, and she said it's pretty bad, so she'd like to go home. So that's okay then. Mom picks her up. Yeah, just this one time sort of thing. We don't like to see a reoccurring thing of this, you know. But I'll call mom if you guys aren't. Actually, I should probably add her to the list of people. Yeah, she's not on there. You have to call down to the district office, the Edison building, and they would be able to add, because you're the only one listed. There's no one under emergency contacts either, and I don't know if you have anybody you wanted listed under there, too. Okay, I understand. I just got to call the district office, though. Yeah, if it's the Edison building, it'd be the district office. Yeah, I can't do that here. So if I could, I would do it for you, but I can't. All right. Okay, I will get her signed out then. All right. Okay, I can actually three-way call mom with you on the phone just to... Oh, sure. Is that what... Oh, go ahead. Okay. Your call has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're trying to reach is... She did not answer, but I'm going to try again a couple of other ways. Okay. Yeah. All right. And then, did you... Let me... Ava, did you get a hold of mom? Okay. Now, dad's going to try to get a hold of her. Okay. Do you want her to try? Yeah, absolutely. She can try as well. Yeah. Ava, why don't you try and see if you can get mom? Okay. Yeah. Okay. I'll have her try, and then if she can't get a hold of her, we'll give you a call back. If we can't get a hold of mom, then I'll just have her lay down in the health office, and she'll have to stay if we can't get a hold of mom, obviously. So... Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I understand. Okay.

Sorry. I mean, I got a big problem. Yeah, what's wrong? Uh, anyways, like, I drank, alright? Mm-hmm. And then I had all this bright idea, and I skipped all on going to like, on Tuesday or today, it would have been today, alright? Uh-huh. And I was gonna go down to Indiana because it was like, I was gonna do party favors and I had two guys down there that had legit cash jobs for me. Okay. Anyways, so I just bought all this party favor bullshit and fucked it off. I can't get rid of this shit, dude. I gotta get rid of it. So, are you calling it party favors? Yeah, I'm calling it party favors, bro. And, um, are they just the same rolls that you had the other day? Yeah, I had the rolls, but I had like a house of some rolls. Mmm. Man. Um, let's see, I don't know. You know, it's too hard to do it, so I thought I'd try. I mean, I don't know, the ecstasy was not that, um, that great. Uh, but if it was like Molly, I would be fucking all over, I'd be at your front door right now. Yeah, I got like an ounce of that, too. You say you have an ounce of that, or are you... I have an ounce of that. Oh, right, right, right, right. Who doesn't? Man, I... I just... Before I passed out, I was gonna buy a pound, but then I passed out, I was like, nah, I should just get an ounce. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Why? Why would you get an ounce? Like, there's not enough money to be made off of that. Uh, because like, if I would've went to Indiana, and I still went, dude. Why? You have court up here. Huh? You have ongoing court cases up here. I don't have, I'm not charged yet, dude. For the DWI? I don't have a court date right now, at all. Oh. Oh, yeah. I thought you had like a DWI like a couple months ago. Yeah, but like, the thing about getting one in Ramsey County is that the county will fucking drop the like, burn the charge up, drop it, and then they release you. And then, uh, basically, wait for those drug tests, the blood tests, you know, come through, or wait for the BCA to get done with that drug test that they gave me. And then, if I'm dirty, you know, the state will pick it up. Right. So nobody's picked it up yet, so I'm just like, you know. So, technically, right now, I'm not charged as shit. Yeah, how long ago did that happen? I thought that happened like a while ago. About a month. Like, a month, out of the nuts. Huh. Yeah. The blood test takes four to like six, sometimes even longer. It's six weeks or longer. That's crazy. I don't know. I can help get you into treatment, and get you onto some services and stuff like that. I can help you out like that. Alright. That's what I'm saying in a day. I still might go to Indiana, yeah, because I can still like, that alone will pay for my food and the round-trip ticket and the cash that I make on top of what's called a fee in the bank. Yeah. Probably just go down there for a couple weeks, you know. Yeah, I don't know. Maybe, yeah, so I guess some people do that. Maybe you could do that, too. I believe you'll be successful in whatever you do. But I'm just saying, the biggest part is because, like, I haven't seen these people in a long time. Before, it's like fucking years before I've seen them. Yeah, I mean, I thought they were like my old friends. They were like family to me. I haven't seen them forever. No, they're not. They're not going to rip me off. I'll take care of it. Ain't nobody ever going to do that again. Three. You're talking about the three Hispanics, 50-some pounds, like, two days ago? Are you saying it's something to do with phones? Where? Oh, okay. Damn, dude. How do you get caught with that many fucking pills? All right. His last name wasn't, like, Leferier, was it? Yeah, I think it was something like that. Leferier? Leferier? Oh, he was with two of us, I know. Yeah, it was the two brothers. Oh, shit. I don't know. I don't know. I feel so. A grill? Yeah, like, I was a bachelor, too. You know, if somebody gave me, like, a nice one, or the ones that are, like, actually, like, stuck to your teeth, like, I'd probably do it. If I had some stupid money, I'd probably do it. At least once, you know? I don't know, I actually, I was kind of into the idea for, like, ten minutes, but then, like, I seen, like, kind of what they look like up close, like, I don't know, when you see them in fucking music videos, or whatever, you assume that they, like, go all the way around the tooth, but it's actually just, like, a fucking thing where it, like, rests just on the front side of it, and, I don't know, when I seen that, I didn't like it, so I was like, that's whack. Well, the expensive ones, they go, like, tooth by tooth, dude. That's what I thought, that's what I'm thinking. The real expensive ones, yeah, but then the clip, they got the clips, like, you're talking about, that's what us beyonds get. I gotcha. Yeah. They actually got to use one of them, like, hammer fucking things, like, to pull them out. The ones that go individually. Like, it's like a fucking rod with a fucking hook, and then, like, it's got a sliding handle. Oh, really? Like, a fucking, you're just, you're saying we need a sling hammer to fucking get the fucking grill in? Like, a specialized tool that we get from AutoZone? Yes, I am. That's serious, dude. Like, you got to use the same tool that you use to, like, get, like, wheel bearings out. Right, or just, like, regular bearings on an engine. Yeah. Yeah. Something like that, you know? Man, you're crazy, dude. Are you at home right now? Hey, bro, I'm not crazy. Can they use it? I've seen it. Dude, I'm gonna go get one of those hammers right now, and I'm gonna come over, and we're gonna make a YouTube video or something. I don't have a grill. I don't have a grill either. So, how's your day been going so far? Have you been productive today? No, absolutely not. What? I'm not ready, dude. I'm gonna clean the fuck out of this apartment, start, like, packing shit. Dude, what is wrong with you? You got weird-ass fucking ideas. Yeah, I think I'm gonna run away and join the circus, dude. I'm not gonna run away. That's what it sounds like you're saying to me right now. I'm just gonna go there for, like, a week or two, dude. It's a visit to work for cash. Hold on. So, I think if you were to reevaluate your plan and say something like, let's go to Florida for a week. Yeah, let's go to Florida. I was talking about that the other day. Or we're all gonna move down there. Once I get this, we're all going, bro. I think if there's, like, ten of us, we could probably get, like, a pretty big ass house. I think so, too. Yeah. Hell, yeah. In fact... I'm serious. You're not serious, bro. I'm serious. You're not serious? I'm fucking serious. I'm serious, too, dude. ... ... ... ... ... ... I feel stalker and all those. Me, too. A little bit. Yeah. But also, that's probably... In my case, it's probably because I need to fucking eat, like, an actual... like, fucking meal. And I... have been kind of, like, just running on orgasm the last 48 hours. ... ... ... I don't want to cook. That's the whole thing. Like, I'm fucking... I don't have any milk, so I gotta go downstairs and get some milk. ... ... ... ... Otherwise, I'm fucking eating eggs and vegetables.

But after mom picks me up, she's probably going to go back to her shift and then afterwards pick the girls up. And also, you need to get that file stuff figured out so this doesn't happen again. Yeah, it says on my file that you're the only like contact. And that's like really inconvenient when I'm trying to get picked up or something and they call you instead of mom. Yeah, yeah, they've been. Yeah, this is the first time I've actually answered one of those calls from the school because every time I call, it calls me all the time. But it's usually like, oh, your student has been seen as absent for the day. And it doesn't actually fucking tell me if you're like just late to class or if you're like actually missing. Right. Yeah, that makes sense. I mean, it doesn't. But I get what you're saying. Okay. Oh, yeah. I guess I'll call the fucking school and add her as like, as a somebody. You can't. It's not something you don't call the school. We have to call the district. Yeah, that's what I meant to say. Okay, yeah. I don't know the number for the district, you can probably look it up though. So what you want to follow. Okay. I couldn't probably look it up. Yeah, just make sure you call the right one it's like Edison something. Yeah, that's the one I was gonna call. All right. Oh, and also, when do you, when do you and Gabby planning getting her car traded in. Well, I, I keep, I'm pro, like, as soon as possible but she wants to wait until she gets her taxes back, which I don't know could be like anywhere from like a week or two or something like that. Right. I mean, I was on Gabby earlier, and she said that she's going to wait until her taxes came back. I don't know. All right, well, I'll talk to you later. Sounds good. Bye.",

Actually, I was kind of trying to figure that out right now, if I should come in kind of like now or not. But what do you got going on? Um, I got a ride here in a minute, and that's when I was going to ask him if I could. I'm going to go to EZ Vibe then. EZ Vibe? Or is that a media? Uh, no, it's a, um... It's a, uh... It's like this place where they have stock of, like, Amazon and Costco products. And, like, they just sell it for, like, really cheap. Like, each day it goes down in price. Dude, that sounds interesting. What's it called? EZ Vibe bins. And they just, like, have these places, like, throughout St. Cloud area or what? It's just one store in, like, either Sartell or Stock Rapids. And, like, they just... They get overstock, and, like, on Friday they fill it each time, and there's just bins of just, like, just random online products that you can get for, like... It's $10 on Friday. It's $9 on Saturday. Or either they're closed on the weekends. I don't know. But it goes down, like, each day, and then they just stock up Friday. Do they, like, show you what's available online? Uh-uh. There's, like, a bunch of random shit, like, in the bins. It's pretty cool. It does sound pretty cool. I'd like to check that shit out. The same owners that get in the smoking cloud on there. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah, yeah, I was going to... But they're open until when today? I'm not too sure. I think, like, 5, maybe? Yeah. 5. Yeah, well, if I don't come in, what do you got going on tomorrow or this evening, I guess? Not too much, I do believe. You know, I was actually... Heidi mentioned that I'm supposed to, like, stay on you, I guess, Now that I've noticed, you were assigned to me, like, a long time ago, huh? You said what? You were a client of mine, like, a long, long time ago, like, back in, like, August or something. Really? Yeah, yeah, like, because I got all tripped out, because when I went to save your name in my phone, I already had, like, a Dakota Barnes in my phone, but it was a different number. Huh. I don't know. Yeah, I mean, I think Heidi mentioned that you, like, signed up a long time ago with her, right? Yeah. Very long, yeah. It was, like, almost two years ago. Oh, really? That long? Yeah. Well, yeah, I was just actually just finishing up an email. I was working from home for the most part, but I was actually going to come in, but if I come in, are you going to meet up with me if I get there soon? Yeah. All right. I'll give you a call when...

Well, when's the last time I did weigh? I don't know. I've never seen the weight. I, I would even, dude, I took like one little, the tiniest gram out of here and that's all I took. It's probably like a point or 10, whatever, one point. That's fine. Yeah. But the thing is, I, um, I'm like driving a long, a great distance to, to, um, deliver it. I mean, you don't have to do that, dude. I mean, well, for me, it's worth it, I guess, because basically I make like $200, like you make $200. I make $200. Oh, man. What's the fuck? All right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But that's the difficult part is like figuring out me just getting down there and like, um, I don't know. I'm going to probably have to give you all the money that I got right now, which I know I don't think it's $200.

Well, uh, yeah. Yes. Let me know. I'm gonna, I'm gonna attempt to eat some dinner right quick. And then afterwards, I'm gonna head out towards your direction, I think.

I did share that guy's info with you, but I don't know if you really knew if I was serious or not. I don't remember that at all, bro. That's what I'm saying, dude. I've been drinking heavy. Yeah. Like I remember being a, I remember being a fucked up motherfucker last night. That's what I remember. Details among a lot of things. I remember some details, but I don't remember a lot of details, especially with you. I don't remember talking to you hardly at all. Any details with you. I don't remember any details I had with you. What did we talk about? Like you keep talking about, I don't remember, bro, and Gabby kept telling me to shut the fuck up. And I remember that because I was just going, dude, I was drunk as fuck, dude, but that's the problem. And then I messaged fucking a hundred people, dude, there's so many messages I've sent in the last few fucking days. And I'm just like, Oh my fucking Christ. Like I'm about to delete every message. I'm just like done checking. I'm done, dude. I'm so fucking sick of it, but I don't know, maybe I'm a slow down or no, I'm a drink in my bed. Okay. All right. All right, buddy. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. And cause I call him and I'm like, Oh my God, I say crazy shit. Sometimes crazy things happen, but most of the time it's just fucking wild. What are you talking about a hot tub? Like if I was you, you know, I was trying to take the day off, I'd be doing it in a hot tub. Don't you have a hot tub over there? No, I ain't got no hot tub. She told me, she asked me, she's like, you want some Xanax? I'm like, no. And I always want Xanax after a day of doing some drugs. But I'll talk to you later. Yeah. Yeah. Wish me luck. I'll be here.

I don't want to go to that meeting, I guess, because I'm probably going to be like it does start at seven.

Exactly. Yeah. Oh my god, now you make me nervous. Pay attention. Pay attention. No, no, there was a there was actually two deers that just ran out in front of me. And I avoided the first one.

But I can just say that it got busted. Uh, yeah, yeah, these guys pretty much got, yeah, I already sent you the article, but, like, these guys got, got busted, like, three days ago, uh, like, right, you know, downtown. And, um, yeah, and it says, like, uh, it says they, they're, like, they live in, uh, Minnesota? Yeah, of course they live in Minnesota. Yeah, they live in, um, fuckin', what is the, what's that fuckin' suburb that's, like, right up 35W? I, yeah, I don't know. Anyways, yeah, well, they, they fuckin', yeah, I grabbed from the dude on the right, like, almost 100%, for sure, before. I don't, I don't know. Damn. Have you talked to a homeboy at all? Um, yeah, probably, like, three days, three days ago. Uh, no, uh, yeah, he called, he messaged me and said that he was about to get it, and, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, like, um. About three days ago? Yeah, I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't yesterday, it was the day before. Yeah. Yeah, and he was like, yeah, I'm about to get it, and I'll have your money, and I wasn't lying to you, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and. I feel like that is, like, kinda coincidental. Maybe, maybe I should ask. I'm gonna ask. I'm actually coming to the area right now, but, uh, I'm only passing through. I'm only passing through. What, in Minneapolis? Yeah. Why are you passing through? What are you doing? So, uh, well, I was talking with Corey earlier, and Corey is, like, I don't know, but he has drugs, and he's, like, I don't know, the other day, he, like, threw his drugs out, and, like, literally sent me, like, a video of him, like, pouring it down the toilet, and I was like, okay, whatever, good for you. Um, and then, um, yeah, and then he, I'm talking to him today, and he's like, yeah, man, I got, like, this ounce, and I don't even know what to do with it, I'm gonna go down to Kentucky, buy a chicken, I don't even know, and he's fucking this on when I'm like, dude, you ain't going down to Kentucky, and fucking give me the fucking ounce, I'll fucking, I know somebody that I can get rid of it too, so. Yeah. Yeah, so I'm gonna go basically make, like, $200 off of this thing, and and then, uh, also pick up my ice house, because I have an ice house. I bet you didn't know. Oh, you do. Yeah, I bet you didn't know that about me, huh? I did not. I bet you didn't even know. No, I don't. Yeah, no, I have actually I've been wanting to go ice fishing like the last, like, couple weeks, and I got a homeboy up that lives up in the morgue with me that I'm thinking about going with, but I don't want to go without a fucking ice house that's, like, just gay. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Huh. What the fuck? Yeah, so where's Cory at? He's, um, fucking off of university, and blah, blah, blah. Yeah. Yeah, he's not too far away. I don't know. He's, like, probably, like, less than ten minutes away from you. Why? Are you, uh, feeling social or something? You want to... I mean, yeah. I mean, it depends on what kind of condition. Uh, I suppose... I guess... If you wanted to, I could pick you up on my way there, and then I could, after we leave there, I could drop you off. That way you're not, like, signing in for, like, some Oregon trail or anything. Right. Well, I am just put in some dinner, and I got, like, three hours sleep last night. So... I'm about to probably just relax. Oh. Of course. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't sleep at all last night, either. I'm, like, running off of, like, pure momentum. And... Yeah. Yeah. Not good. I don't know. I gotta work tomorrow. I gotta be around some people tomorrow. But I'll sleep tonight, for sure. Mm-hmm. Well, sure. Anyways, um... Okay. But you can stop by if you want to. Man, that sounds really tempting. Yeah. I'd be okay with seeing you. Yeah? And I don't even care, like, I mean... So, I was thinking, if you're with him, you can stop by, too, but, I mean, that's only if he's on his best behavior. Oh, no. No, no, no. That would be, like, uh... Yeah. Yeah. Besides, I can't bring him around you. I already gave him to my other baby... to my other baby mom. Yeah. I'm good. Good on that. I don't know. Who are you else? Is your baby mama? Well... Let's just assume that if I did have another baby mama, I may have tried to wife her off or something like that. I don't know. What's the fucking... the religious term? Like, I don't know. Like, I had two sister wives. Now I don't want them. I don't know. All right. I'll give you a call. I got to punch some shit into my phone to figure out which...

Francis basically and then she drives all the way to downtown to fucking that's crazy to me dude you should tell her to apply at mine right now like right now we need fucking openers so bad yeah we need openers cuz my managers trying to get me to do opening shifts and I always work for the clothes every night and I don't I don't do that opening shit I'm not a I just got like adjusted to this sleeping schedule where I'm up until like 3 in the morning and then I go to sleep but until like 1 a.m. or until 1 the next day so yeah I'm not going once again I gotta go to this pizza just for you I don't know we need openers so bad you tell her go find right now and and she's gonna make more fucking dominoes and tips and she is anywhere else because it's such a high everybody knows like it's it's like one of the biggest pizza places that have you know I mean yeah I was gonna ask you fucking so when's the last time you talked to with Tom Tom shows dude it's been a couple days why because he fucking ripped off my homegirl dude he won't even answer the phone to me he was supposed to fucking put me on his phone bill had it all set up dude and the motherfucker won't even answer the fucking phone to me hey yeah I fucking am yeah can you hear me yeah I can hear you oh cool I didn't know I could have you on my deck yeah so I fucking we um you're gonna put me on his phone bill and it's been like fucking four or five days he just all of a sudden won't answer nothing what's up with it what are you trying to do with a phone I could put you on my phone bill instead yeah I need I need to get a phone leased out to me and only reason why I won't do it in my own name is because I fucking I like a long time ago I had an AT&T account and I um I didn't like fuck him over on a phone or anything but I fucked him over on my phone bill like I didn't I didn't pay my bill and then I decided to switch services mm-hmm oh yeah I remember I was around for that yeah yeah so I didn't like fuck him over on a phone or anything but I fucking need somebody who can get a phone like you know we're like T-Mobile Verizon whatever I mean I have a I have Google five if you're familiar with that like uh like unlock phones or like yes but you have to be like yeah you got to either be like go through their Google financing or like or you got really like use Klarna which is like basically like yeah I know I pay for my phone all right so I don't have to do this monthly payments but like there are I can't afford a phone right now but I need one so bad dude and I fucking I can't get one leased out to me because I have a pending bill they want me to pay before they'll even let me open up an account and then they said that they definitely aren't gonna be leasing me a phone I'm like dude I didn't even fuck you guys over on a phone dude it was a fucking phone bill like it was a phone service yeah I just got this job and I make enough to fucking I always have gone through $25 a month for unlimited everything and it like works everywhere I don't ever have an issue with my phone service so I always go to visible but they don't do that on there it's like it's not a government thing but I don't I don't know they don't they don't lease phones out to people in general yeah I mean I actually have because somebody on my family plan actually just fucked up their phone so they need to get a new phone so I was like pricing it out for them and like I so like a 500 or $600 phone that's like basically the same as mine you can get through Klarna if your initial payments like 240 bucks and then it's two more yeah they also have those of course yeah yeah no no problem with that yeah so with the fucking payment plan that they showed me was like they wanted like 240 up front for the for the phone and then two payments every two weeks have like 80 bucks until it's paid so I think it was like yeah it's like four payments basically is what Klarna was doing yeah I mean I think I could send you this fucking length like yeah I just sent to somebody else but I don't know if this is actually connected to him or not but I'm actually about 95% sure that I just I was just fucking some of Ivan's fucking you know his goons I think they got fucking popped well Tom Tom and Tom knows Ivan like that cuz we're just we were just kind of having those conversations yeah I just sent you the thing yeah but that happened three days ago and I'd like to these dudes I'm like 100 almost 100% sure that that's those are the dudes no they've actually just got according to the fucking article it said that they got pulled over for like I don't know they were they've switched lanes and fucking stopped and did whatever the fuck they got police attention oh no no no no no but yeah Tom was supposed to pick up from them and this was like three days ago and the reason why I kind of the reason why I kind of know that it was them yeah hey I sent you a location the other day and I asked you I was like dude isn't this the location of where your fucking ex lived do you ever see what I was showing you I will I'm on yeah cuz he's this is the address that he gave me and me and Becky and then and then I was like looking at it and I was like dude I fucking cuz when I punched it in yes I sent you the address yeah I sent it to you on a fucking Facebook messenger I mean so like that one day that you got that I met with your ex that you were fighting with and got my truck out of the impound yeah yeah that guy when we when we went a little we went a little fucking like a little ride in that area in this neighborhood and this is like where we went you like went and parked in front of like a garage and we were just talking for a while yeah yeah oh yeah that's that is that what actually what he said yeah he said that oh yeah that fucking figures because that's he's the type of person to be in prison I guess god bless yeah I guess I guess I'm gonna hey dude so you're when do you get off work tonight that's bigger phone 1 a.m. interesting interesting nothing I want to see your baby yeah he's like pulling teeth trying to find a fucking baby there fuck my life it will be good like dude it's so hard to find daycare like every day I go to work it's like fucking it's costing me so much I'm so fucking good man Gabby Gabby was a carefree for you yeah I work I work really late so that's the thing I it's gotta be somebody who can be up until 1 in the morning you know oh my gosh I'm up until 1 in the morning I am I am everybody people go out of their way to I guess you just you know where I live though so I mean that's kind of a that's kind of yeah yeah we figure it out though yeah I don't know I work four days a week from work clothes and nah the next fucking like two weeks these upcoming two weeks so I'm gonna have fucking a few morning shifts dude fuck my life that's stuck I'm pissed that she's making me do that dude I fucking just got my schedule used to the Florida clothing and I got a little like you know like I got my little schedule scheduled and I'm cool and this bitch wants to switch my ship like from morning open to call open to four like you gotta be fucking kidding me dude I don't even like morning I'm not gonna make shit for tips cuz I'm a fucking cunt in the morning you know yeah yeah yeah you're not gonna get any fucking tips in the morning that's like when nobody nobody's fucking ordering pizza at that time I know dude I'm pissed about it I'm fucking pissed like now I gotta fit that into my schedule and I don't know it's like one thing after another dude I'm so fucking like stressed out dude I don't know you haven't even came to my new place yeah what are you doing when I get off work I went over to your place yeah yeah yeah um but you're how long you've been sober are you are you I'm not over why I just didn't want to fucking what do you corrupt you if you're on do I sound fucking sober dude yeah no I actually uh I'm still I'm still fucking uh I'm selling people recovery and and uh all these life lessons and then I'm smoking meth on the side yeah I heard I heard you're gonna be my person that goes to court with me if I ever need it I am I am huh I yeah yeah don't you people like go to court for people and vouch for them to say they've been doing great and all the whatever yeah more I mean more than that I mean I mean if you if you knew some of the people I know I work with like they have like I don't know mental health mental health things actually matter of fact you're gonna be a part of my fucking pure recovery you're gonna speak to my child services lady how about that yeah I could do that can you vouch that I take you is that thing I mean I and in a sense that they're gonna like want to see the lab results and shit like that I don't think I can yeah I mean yeah we're trying we could try something but I do have to take you is firm for fucking that shit right now and fucking I'm just I don't know it's like I have to time I am sober dude fucking I have to get sober like fucking like every other week I'm sober you know because I'm so scared that they're gonna come fucking call his mom saying some foul-ass shit dude she's making some shit up dude about me that will get my kid taken to it like she's telling the fuck she sat there and made this phone call between Tony saying that then I smoked meth with my kid in the same room and I'm out hitting licks all night with him and stealing shit with him from stores boosting crazy shit Brandon I'm not doing dude I would never in a million years smoke with my fucking kid in the room I wouldn't I am I how am I out boosting and hitting licks they claim that I fucking I'm feeling baby formula I'm on wick like dude left and right it would serve just feel a nice thing because like it would just be really nice to have that like kind of you know whatever it is you want to do I mean because when it comes to that like me working for doing it for you in that sense like it's always gonna be what you decide to do it's never gonna be what I want you to do oh my gosh and that brings me back to my next thing like if you don't want me to fucking hit on you and if I can get all up in your fucking your personal space you're probably not you probably are gonna want to hire me like in a legal sense but yeah yeah because if I if I actually legitimately work for you like that I saw I could lose my license hooking up yeah oh you said hook it up for doing the u.s. in the UA things yeah I'm gonna tell them about you you're gonna be my new worker whatever you are your recovery coach right or specialist yeah I could send you my send you my thing yeah how can I actually get involved with you so I'm actually like a person on your caseload type thing but like you know what I mean yeah you just gotta follow this I'll send you a link because I'm all about them fucking links I know you saw I tell you that I don't have your contact safe and you're like I'll send you a link oh shit that's right I did tell you to send so if I can download this link already but yeah if you click that link it's gonna fucking auto download my shit under your thing and then you you'll see like the signup things okay all right you don't have to do it right now no yeah I'll do it I fucking I need to do it though fuck that'd be fucking sweet dude that'll take them off my back a little more you know they're already like I don't know I already told him I'm like look you guys can talk to my appeal I I'm not I'm not a problem I've never I've never failed you a but I've only taken one UA and my appeal from Hennepin County is like I trust you because your baseline was clean from everything so I'm not even gonna worry right so I mean I think I just switched to like your your fucking car Bluetooth or something can you even hear me hello my bad you've gone on my speaker on my in my car hold on yeah you're fine okay hello but yeah I just I don't want to risk I don't want my people so my appeal the CPS ID I was like when she came at told me tell me that she knew the way cuz Kota's mom said that I was using I fucking I've told I freaked out you know I that was a day I was supposed to move up to my mom's supposedly to her according to her I fucking freaked out dude I'm like okay and she gave me a little this little card thing to bring to the Medical Center you know yep yeah so I fucking I took I told her I was gonna go and then I fucking I just I went into my dad's and I fucking yeah pretty much I know showed but if they don't she's not even like she's not considering that a failed UA they just cuz I was like look the reason why I'm not taking this UA is because well for one there's an OFP on Dakota me on Dakota for me okay and this is his mom who he lives with making the report so this is definitely um this is definitely not it's definitely a way for them to just try to get at me and I'm not feeding into her allegations against me it's not right this is harassment and this should be a violation of Dakota's OFP if you ask me you know and um so she's so she's like what she didn't really consider it like a failed one we didn't really even talk about what she considered it but she never said nothing about failed UA or refusing you like it wasn't a big deal at all she understood kinda I think but I was like look I'm on fucking probation if there's a supervised probation with random UAs so if there's an issue you um if there is an issue I will bring you my UA results from my PO and you guys can just suck a dick you know pretty much I'm not taking a UA for you guys I'm already on supervised probation well my PO I only took one UA for the baseline UA and she's super fucking cool like she don't she don't want she's like she's like look I don't even want to meet with you in the office you're the least of my worries we can knock you down to fucking unsupervised probably in like a year here like she doesn't you know she doesn't do nothing like that and I don't want to ask her to just for the CPS thing but um I have to be able to tell CPS like you know I mean CPS is gonna poke around with that yeah yeah you have to sign an ROI with the probation officer to the to that to that fucking lady and then once they get like the results once and they say that you're fucking like I know we already did that we already did that but I don't want to have a release of information because I don't want my POE hearing anything about any kind of reportable drugs you know but like I don't want I know but it's not gonna be like I mean you can't help that like somebody like was talking some shit that's not on you you're technically a victim yeah yeah but I don't know I just didn't even want cuz like she's like she's like drugs aren't she asked me though she's like have you ever been treatment have you ever done this I'm like nope nope I told her no that I don't drugs isn't an issue and so like she thinks that there's nothing drug like than my life my PO does so to have somebody else that I can just say be like that I can tell CPS that I can be like look I take you is that way CPS doesn't even bring this shit up to my PO you know about the reports cuz they can get bring it up to you and then you can tell me two reports I don't know I fucking this shit's do it it's fucking dead I'm so pissed about it like there's no reason why Kota's mom she can't even legally can't even call CPS on me there's with him I mean you know I had like probably five or six allegations brought up against names and it's kind of the same old thing they've come over they're like meet me walk through my house like and at the end they're like okay well just to be safe you know come and come down and take you away you know just make sure you guys get down in the next couple of days and then I would like wait like three or four days like right yeah I know that's what I usually do but they don't give you three or four days they gave me a day yeah yeah fuck them yeah so that's why I figure if I have somebody who can say that I'm already taking them they're not even gonna be worried about that cuz they're gonna be in my life right now for the next they said six months minimum to a year because they're in the middle of terminating quotas rights and um and so there's an open case with them for quotas shit so they're not there for me they're there to terminate his rights and deal with that but I because I'm the only liable parent for King they want to know they said that my only case plan is that I have to make sure I'm remaining it keeping good housing yep housing school doctors appointments all that shit to keep up with all that that's my only them were my only things that I have to do for it so I was like okay that's fine that's fine well they have to come to my house to see me two times a month for the next six months to a year and then in between that six months to a year quotas mom has all the time she can to fucking be like make her reports and or have other she was asking other people I have a audio recording of her asking somebody else to call CPS on literally asking people to call CPS on me doing so it's like you know I mean like it's just it's like fucking over this next six months to a year it sucks because they're already in my life so I already have an open case plan with them that I have to have them coming in my house and talking to them and keeping in contact with them that's another part of mine so that's what's that's the only reason why I like I don't know I just fuck I don't know I'm just over it dude I'm fucking this sucks because like this is harassment to her her calling child services she's called child services on me twice and my son wasn't even fucking two months old yet I can barely hear you yeah now I can it sounded weird it sounded like it was like a TV back in the background or something yeah sorry it's my Bluetooth headphones oh but yeah so it's like just fucking I don't know I'd be nice to have something like that you know yeah yeah I definitely got your back I'm trying to figure out if I can get my errands done I gotta run out to Alexandria and then back here why don't you come back after yeah that's what I meant to say yeah oh okay okay I'm like it's okay too if it's a little bit later that like a little bit I won't even I get out of here at like one and then I have to go to Coon Rapids to go pick up my son and I have to go home so like it's all right if it's a little later than that I don't care you know it would probably honestly work out it probably honestly work out better anyways if it was a little bit later like around like two or three well you got my location you'll see where I'm okay I'll just call you at like I'll call you at like 1230 to one and and see where you're at but yeah let's shoot let's try to shoot for it at the earliest like to that way I have time to go get the baby and get home and kind of get settled in okay yeah I don't know I just I don't know but you got to come somewhere you play tonight you're summoned absolutely yeah I actually I told you I told you that I'm a creeper and I actually drove past your place yeah you gotta come to the inside not the outside I know guys yeah that was weird of me but yeah I got you I would love to thank you huh I would love to thank you oh yeah I'll see you after I get off work all right I'll talk to you soon I'll call I'll call you a little closer to them too all right first easy all right all right",

I mean, if I'm somebody else, I know somebody else, I could probably get more of what you're trying to get. But I don't get the money for it until I bring it to him. So that's my buddy. Yeah. From up north. Well, the person that you just got an offer from was like nine hundred for a QPR. This is really beautiful woman in front of me is thinking, I don't know. One second. Oh, my God. Yeah. How much do you have that you're trying to get rid of right now? I've got you kind of I'm talking to two different people that are in front of me right now. So I guess she said that she does not have a quarter pound left on her. So I'm going to I'm going to put you on speakerphone down. Just so you're part of the conversation. You're talking about Coke right now. Just so you're part of the conversation. You're talking about Coke right now. You like you like Coke. That's all right. You know, there's no market. Yeah. Have you tried DMT yet? What? Have you tried DMT yet? No. No. Are you afraid of it? Would you be into that? You're into psychedelics. What is it? DMT. It's the spirit molecule. It's like a trip, but it doesn't last like very long. I got that. All right. I got mushrooms. Yeah. Yeah. It's kind of similar to mushrooms, but the DMT is specifically different a little bit. So yeah, I'm probably good with that. I got enough problems. Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, he's just trying to figure out how much I could bring him tonight. And yeah, yeah. Simon, do you have an idea how much? How much are you trying to pay for it? How much are you trying to pay for the quarter pound? How much do you got, I guess, is what the question is. Can you still hear me, sir? Yeah, I'm there. I'm here yet. Okay. I'm checking some things off. Can you still hear me, sir? Yeah, yeah. I'm there. I'm here yet. Okay. I'm checking some things out here. Oh, he's counting some things out right here. Oh, I got, um, tonight I got. I got, um, you're right. I mean, I could get more, but. How much? I got 650 right now. 650. And I could get, you know, I probably could go get some more, but. For sure. I got right now. How soon would you be able to get it by the time I'm up there? Which would be like, uh, I can't remember. An hour and 15 minutes to go up there. Yeah, I probably could. I don't know what you're talking about. Um, here, hold on one second. I would have to. Okay, so now. Can you hear me? It's been brought to my attention that, uh, uh, what she has left on her right now. Uh, so what's in the room right now is her personal. And then we're still only got that one zip. Like it's a couple of grams less than a zip. That's all you got is one. Yeah. Yeah. Cause I guess the one that she has is for personal. And that's just for right now. Like if we wanted to get more, we could like plan for that. But I was just recommending to go with whatever was here. Yeah. Yeah. I'm down with that. I don't know how much she's not paying for it or not. Maybe, you know, I don't know. I never got my call back yet either. So yeah, I've heard it before, you know, and it doesn't come through. It does, but it doesn't always. You're talking about like, uh, you know, the store number two, you mean? Yeah. Um, what would you do? And, uh, when I go around, I, uh, I love, I get to load the ice house on the truck or on the car. On the car. Yeah. Yeah. I don't have my truck anymore. I just, I just got this fucking stupid little Metro sexual vehicle. A Metro. No, it's, it's, it's a Chevy tracks. It's Gary's car. You think you're going to load it on top of that? Yeah. It's got a loaded rack. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Um, okay. Well, I'm gonna, I'm gonna wrap this up then I'm going to be on my way. And if anything changes in the next few minutes that you want to change on your end, just give me a call. Otherwise, then, uh, 10 minutes or less, I'm going to be on my way. All right. Okay. All right. You want to, you want me to text you everything just so we can see it and all right. All right. Three 50 for 28, right? Or 28 for three 50. Uh, I think he said he's got 27. He said that you had 25 grand. Exactly. Yeah. He says like 20. He's just under. Okay. Okay. All right. All right. I'll talk to you soon.",

You need anything? Like. Like what? I don't know, like speedboats, fucking, um. I don't know, high-priced jewelry. Fucking the one thing that most people sell at this time of night. Oh, is somebody trying to make some money or boo something for me? No, no, no. I guess I should probably just say it outright. Yeah, my buddy has some fucking dope. He's trying to get rid of it. It's basically like $120 a quarter and around that price range. Of dope? Yeah, I mean. $120 a quarter? I'd be trying to get rid of that for a very long time. Fuck no. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, fuck no. He basically has like a. He's trying to get rid of that for a very, very long time. That's what I used to sell mine at. Yeah, yeah, but you guys are nuts. You guys are out of your mind. Wow. You're right. I bet he is trying to sell that. Yeah, I'm going to put you on speakerphone. Because he was really pissed when he figured out how much he had. Yeah, yeah, so he. You're going to be trying to sell that for a very long time, my friend. Yeah, he's. Yeah, basically we got to try to like sell it in small. In the smallest amounts of whatever is just to make. Or I can just eat it all. Right on. Yeah, he's. Eat all of it. Or go to eat all of it. I pay less. I pay less than half that order. Okay, there ain't no way. I'm buying that. Me too. Yeah, we typically do too. Yeah, I think. Yeah. Yeah. What do I look like? Well, I didn't know if you were like. Yeah, nice try. I thought I was trying to pull a bull over my eyes. It's not like that. All right, whatever. I'm still coming over after this. You were just like the last person I was going to call before.

Would it be helpful if I just went and got your baby and met you? One last thing you had to do. It would. It would. But I got to talk to her. I'm trying to get her to be like a weekly thing. So I got to talk to her about that and try to like, you know, persuade her. And not only that, but it's my uncle's like baby housewife type thing. Like he goes out and fucks a bunch of women. And that's like his housewife that he keeps at home with his kids. Son, he wouldn't be a stranger to you having random guys calling and taking up. Yeah. I would be a bitch. Yeah. For that one. So that is, that is sexist. So a guy can go out and sleep with my name. Fucking whatever. Whatever. That's fucking straight up entrapment. You have your rights. I feel like. That's crazy.

    "transcript": "Hello. What's up? You called at just the right time. I did. Yeah. I've been kind of whipping around driving just kind of so sorry the last message I sent you was a text message but yeah I could probably explain better what it meant. I overlooked that. Something about Becky, Becky specifically said that if you have an idea, if you can tell, if you have an idea of what you're trying to grab you can arrange it ahead of time and like basically have available by tomorrow sort of thing whatever. Yeah. But like I've mentioned you know like you know you being you know the Dan from up north that I meet with and so yeah she knows to uh yeah to take your order basically yeah. So I know you mentioned earlier that you were trying to get like a QP for like nine. Yeah well that's what they said you know. Yeah I mean it does sound like a good price. I'll see if she can get it that for that. Well I don't I mean not right now though. I mean are you coming or not? Um no no no no no but the I guess the shit that yeah this is the yeah after fucking a Corey and my buddy that was I was with it kind of explained to me what because he had an ounce but at first he told me that he paid like this much amount for it but then he's like and then he told me like a different number and I thought he meant like two ounces but he actually paid an almost like basically almost like four hundred dollars for this one ounce and he didn't really know it until he had like weighed it. So uh yeah. So you got yeah he got kind of yeah he kind of got a fast one pulled on him because I guess this guy didn't have a fucking scale when you gave it to him or whatever but yeah yeah so he was pissed and and then that's when Becker was like yeah let's just you know if I can if he's trying to get more than you know what's here right now um you know if you can basically have it available. All right. And another thing to consider to consider is um I I don't know if I had a chance to tell you but I like work basically full-time in St. Cloud now. Oh yeah? Yeah. Yeah I wasn't like totally voluntarily but uh yeah I'm in fucking St. Cloud like five six days a week now. Yeah? Yeah. That's not bad. Uh I mean it's not bad yeah so it's okay. I'm still getting kind of like used to where everything is and all that other bullshit. What's that? Uh I didn't say anything. So I don't know do you? Say what? I don't know I'm just kind of laying here and relaxing. All right. So. Well as long as they know. Yeah so I mean if you have an idea how much so here's my my ulterior motive because I've been trying to go to the last like two weeks and my my whole arm ice fishing doesn't have a fucking good working ice house so it's like fucking it's like I can't hear you. Oh yeah I could just text you. No just text just give me a minute here. Okay. A couple seconds. So then we'll put the cover on the fucking deep fryer I guess. Make it fry faster. Okay. One more two more seconds. Okay. All right now I can hear you. You still there? Are you can you hear me? Yeah I can hear you now. Yeah I was trying to timer out for you make some burgers and fries for you. Yeah so I just made them but. Oh yeah. Yeah that would have been very kind of you dude I I'm fucking looking forward to fucking seeing you and catching up soon. Yeah yeah plus I got a bunch of mushrooms too. A trip out here. Oh yeah. For a few hours. Yeah you've never you've never you've never done DMT before? Uh-uh. Have you have you heard of it though? Maybe a long time ago. Is it like uh a clear liquid that you got to dry up or something? Well I guess it comes in a couple different forms but um I don't know if you've heard of it. If you would have heard about it a long time ago like I guess fucking they used to drink it like tea and yeah fucking I don't know if you want to go do with like the whole shaman fucking thing. But yeah it comes from nowadays you can like smoke it like in a bubble which is kind of whack but the way I tried it most recently it was like in a it's almost like a vape. Yeah and uh yeah that shit was actually pretty good. You know you take a deep hit of it and it lasts probably like I don't know it seems to last probably around like 10 minutes or less. But like when you're when you're like I don't know how to explain it like the fucking DMT DMT is like because of what it is it it's uh I guess you just got to do a little bit of research what DMT is. It's like a natural body that your natural chemical that your body produces but it produces it when you're like an infant and also when you're dying. Does that make sense? When you're dying. Yeah yeah when you're so like when you're like just a infant like you're born uh like you have like a bunch of DMT in your brain and then it eventually like goes away. You're tripping when you come into the world. Yeah and then once you when you're dying Yeah and then once you when you're dying to you know a slow death you have a bunch of DMT that gets released in your brain during that time too. And then another fucking thing is DMT is actually the only uh DMT is the one thing that you is found in every living uh thing on the planet. So there's a plant. You can't test you for it then? No no there's no test for it. I mean like yeah they don't test for that. Yeah but it only lasts five minutes is that what you said? Yeah it's like five ten minutes depending on how big a hit you take. Yeah but it's uh it's definitely pretty cool. It's not it's not like salvia. I fucking hate salvia. What's that? It's like fucking I don't know some weird fucking weed sort of shit. I don't know whack. I don't know. All right well I'm actually I do got to work tomorrow and I'm kind of like on a borderline turning into a creature. So I'm gonna try to get a little bit of rest before I have to go. Turning into a creature? Yeah a creature a meth monster. Yeah? Yeah. I've been thinking about that too. That's what you've been doing? Well I haven't been doing it but I kind of thought about it a few times. Becoming a a mess monster or something different? I thought you said a preacher. Yeah no not a preacher. No not like I'm I'm not fucking preaching the gospel. No I meant like yeah great creature a creature they are like. Oh creature? Yeah. Oh yeah. I don't know about turning into a creature but. Yeah I wouldn't recommend it either. I'd like to start a church in my garage. You want to you want to start a church? Yeah. Really? Nope. Well I'm interested to hear. You'll have to tell me more about that. Well I don't know nothing about it but I just know that if you start a church in your house you don't have to pay taxes on it. That's what the Amish do. They do a whole bunch of shit like that. Yeah. Yeah. But I suppose. Yeah. Say it again. Then I did probably say I was a Koresh. Well I mean you don't plan on uh. Screwing little balls and all. Yeah doing all the extra stuff. No not really. I mean I worked a little bit but not really. Well yeah they'd have to be at least 17. Oh my god. That's that's legal anyway right there ain't it? Well I suppose like you you yeah if you had a bunch of groupies then yeah you would be the next David Koresh because of all the firearms and shit you got at your place. Yeah. All right. All right.

I pulled over to try to put the fucking thing on that phone holder thing. Are you fucking for real? You wouldn't want me to fucking... It was too dangerous for me to do that while I was fucking driving. Well, obviously, but like it's super not important. Well, to me it was. You're going to be home by 4.15. Now you're going to be like walking in right when my mom's like waking up. It's all fucking weird. It's not weird. Even if it is weird, it's kind of weird. Then why weren't you answering then? What do you mean? I called you like 12 times. Yeah, my phone either didn't ring or I didn't hear it or. I just seen you. I was calling because I was moving. My phone was kind of in front of me. I find that hard to believe, but whatever. I'm like on some... you had turned off. I know, I've been stalking you. I've been stalking you ever since I was like 47 onto this like one road. Thank you for stalking me. I often wonder if people ever like think about where I am. And then I navigated it and said you'd be here by 4.15. And I was like, cool, awesome. So I fell back asleep and then it was like 4.20 or something. And I was like, dude, where the fuck is this guy? And I look and it says you're in Ogilvy, like off this random road, like by a field. And then it said that you were like inside the nearest house over there. And I was like, does he know someone over there? And then it moved you back to the side of the road. And then that's when I called you a whole bunch of times because I was like, maybe he's tired. And he pulled off to like sleep. And this was like the best area because it's like not by a house. And it's like in the middle of nowhere. So a cop can't just like stroll through. Hello? I'm listening. Oh. And so then I was calling you like 12 times because I was like, maybe he's just sleeping. Don't wake you up. Yeah, no, for. And it's time with Phoenix for a while. And she had this guy over. She said, I don't know what she said. It was a friend of hers. But like he works nearby where she lives. And and then I guess he like crashed his truck recently. And she was like, trying to like be helpful to him. And I guess I went to get the baby. Like, even though he like didn't like, I didn't see like any signs of like aggression or anything like that. I he was like, I don't know. I don't know. Kind of being mean and being disrespectful to her. And she had to like show me via text that that's what was going on. And I was like, what are we talking about? Like. Some like psychological warfare. I'm like, I don't know. I don't think she was banged. I'm almost positive that she's not banging the dude. I don't know. And the weird thing is that I know the guy from somewhere. Like, I just could not figure out from where. Probably jail. No, I'm like, most definitely like, I don't know. His name is G and he's black. Does that remind you? Does that ring a bell for you? Huh? No, I said, and he had the baby. I'm confused. Yeah. Why did he have the baby? I don't know. She was trusting her baby with anyone. Well, I guess she was describing that. She's currently fighting with her dad. Well, hopefully that guy's a nice man. I wouldn't be trusting my fucking baby with fucking randoms. Yeah. I don't know. Like, I don't know. I'm like, well, just let me know how I can be of assistance. I don't know. I can. I like he said, he mentioned something about life. Friend of his. I got a car for him for like 250 bucks and North branch. Yeah. I can take you to drop you off there. On my way back. And. I wasn't having that. And then. Phoenix is like. Yeah, like I gotta go drop this guy off and get rid of them. And. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. He's trying to be helpful somewhere or another, but. Yeah, that was the. That was the road she took. I was like, I can like, hang out. With a baby while he like sleeps. And, you know, that way you don't have to fucking take them out. I'm like an adventure. Fucking. Okay. Cool. Okay. Here. Hello. Almost here. You're about to turn on to 23. There's the. That's what it looks like. Yeah. She would come and drop her baby off and then come pick them up. She says something along the lines of like. She usually. It's usually works. Like. I think she just said, Mike. So, like, she'd be picking. Dropping them off and picking them up. You know, Before or after that time. She works after dinner time till 1.00 PM or 1.00 AM. Just about dinner time to. 1.00 PM. 1.00 AM. Yes. Yeah. But then you said dinner time. So I'm like, that doesn't make sense. So it's. Dinner time to 1.00 AM. Yeah. Me and Ben Franklin were fucking. Up for four days and we don't really. Notice those sort of. New ones. Yeah. Yeah. I hope so too. I slept. Kind of nicely. Okay. Okay. I never sent you the picture of. The deer heading. Did it do something? It. Left like. A mark in the. And. No, I didn't leave any sort of dent or stretch. No. But you could tell where it had. Okay. So if you're walking by, are you like, what is that? I don't know. It's like somebody fucking. Like leaned against there. Your car and like. Yeah, just, I don't know. It's about the size of a hamper engine. It's like, just goes. It's like a stripe. Okay. Yeah. Well, the cool thing is I'm certain that that guy lived. Right. All right. Okay. Slow and steady wins the race. I'll talk to you in a few minutes. It'd be nice if there was like something to eat there, but. In fact, motherfucker. I don't know. I have it in me to fucking. I'm not going to get a pizza this early. There's pizza here. Okay. I'd rather you go grab a pizza or something. I can be walking around like fucking. Okay. Yeah. Sometimes my health is like a hazard. All right. Bye.",

And we're trying to follow up on a couple of different things I was hoping you could help out with. Sure, this is a reception area, so I have to know what was, yeah, I guess what it's regarding and then I'll have to transfer you on. So I guess the first thing that we're kind of interested in was we needed, we're trying to get a voucher, a reduced fee form, so that she can get her driver's license without having to pay the, so I guess there's a reduced fee form that you guys- Yeah, is she on financial programs currently with Stearns County? Yeah, she has medical assistance and GRH and- Okay. And also, she was starting the process to get disability and I don't know- With Social Security? Yeah, I don't know if that process involves starting out with MN Choices or not. Yeah, not. So let's see, let's get, I'm just going to, because I'm going to need to transfer you on to that financial unit that handles her case and that's who you're going to need to get this voucher from. What is her last name? Last name is McCarter, so let me, you want to just spell that for her? M-C-C-A-R-T-E-R. Did you get that? No, I didn't. Oh, sorry, say it again. M-C-C-A-R-T-E-R. What about that time of year? No, we, no, if she's in the background, if she's in the background, I'm not going to be able to hear with this headset, so I just, M-C-C, I know that part. I think maybe, can you put her on the phone? Oh, here it is, M-C-C-A-R-T-E-R. Okay, and her first name was? Janelle, that's J-A-N-E-L. J-A-N-E-L, okay, and then how about Janelle's date of birth? 8-15-78. 8-15-78. Okay, let's take a look. Just an FYI, when I do transfer you, I mean, is she available to talk to? Yeah, she's, yeah, she has the headset on. Yeah, because they're probably going to want to, they're going to probably want to talk to her. Okay, so I see Janelle's case here, but it's not open in Sterns. Wait a minute, I got to make sure I got the right person here. Let's do it a different way. Can I have her social security number? Because if we've got more than one, I'm going to have to run through them all. I don't want to have to do that. Yeah, so, 471-985-441. Okay, let's see here. Okay, yeah, this brought me right in. Okay, now. Yeah, so I'm seeing she's on general assistance, G-A. But it's not in Sterns County, it's in McLeod. Yeah, yeah, and we, she is, you know, a homeless status, but it would be a good idea to move her to this county because she is. Yeah, and what has to be done is, we don't send for cases, she's going to need to connect with McLeod County and talk to them to get this case moved to wherever she, you know, she's in Sterns, that they get that sent to us. Because we can't do anything until the case is physically back, or, you know, transferred to us. Okay, I can make sure that that is done immediately. Yeah, so I'm just showing here, I can give you her worker's name in McLeod County, and her phone number. Her name is Nina, N-I-N-A. And her last name is H-E-D, as in dog, I-N, as in Nancy. And her direct phone line is 320-864-1506. And then also mention to her what she's looking to get, because they may be able to do that right away, to get that voucher. Okay. I don't know if they'll have to wait until it's here or not, but I would run it past her. And does she, does it show a case, her case number? Yeah, it does. I got that. It's 490439. Okay, now, would it be possible for you to send an ROI so that once we do get that transfer, yeah, we can communicate, I can communicate with you guys on her behalf? Yeah, hang on. Yeah, hang on. Let me pull it up here. I'm going to try and do it while I got you on the phone. Let's see. It's just going to be a general ROI. So let me just get this here. Okay, I'm going to want to have this mail. Whoops. Shoot. Pull that back up. Oh, come on. What's going on here? Okay, for some reason, it's not pulling my phones up. Hang on. I'm going to just, I'll get some paper here and I'll get her name down. Okay. Are we mailing it out to you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, what's your name? My name is Brandon, B-R-A-N-D-O-N. Last name's Gillis, G-I-L-L-E-S. And then the organization is Generation Hope. Generation, did you say Hope? Generation Hope? Yeah, yeah. H-O-P-E, okay. I want to make sure I got Brandon, your last name right. G-I-L-L-E-S, isn't it, Sam? Yep, yep, that's correct. And an address? The email address is- Oh, email it. Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah, yeah, definitely email. So it's L-E, so it's Lima Echo Golf, Indy. Okay, so wait a minute, L-E-G-I-T, and then it's my last name, so G-I-L-L-E-S. G-I-L-L-E-S, okay. Is that all one word, L-E-G-I-T, G-I-L-L-E-S? Yep, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, and then it's at L-I-V-E dot com. L-I-V-E dot com, so let me just make sure I got that right.

Yeah, I suppose we'll follow up with- Yeah, then reach out to the name Nina, get her case transferred, and then get your ROI done, and I don't know if they'll want a copy of it, too, but then once it gets here, make sure that we get a copy as well.

I'm calling on behalf of Janelle McCarter, who's with me right now, and we're trying to get in touch with her caseworker, Mina Hedden. Let's see. I do have a case number, if that helps at all. One moment. McLeod County Social Services, this is Mina. How can I help you? Hi, Mina, this is Brandon Gillis. How are you doing? Good, what can I help you with? Well, I'm with Generation Hope, and I'm calling on behalf of Janelle McCarter, who's actually with me right now. Janelle, can you say hi? Oh, maybe you can hear her now. Hi there. So the reason why we were calling was to, because we were just notified that we're trying to get some benefits and some assistance, and we realized that she must have applied for benefits in a different county a while ago. So we need to update her address so that you guys can transfer it to the new county. Okay, can I get, what was the client's name again? Janelle McCarter. How do you spell the last name? M-C-C-A-R-T-E-R. Let me see if I can find her here. I do have a case number. Yes, that would be extra helpful. 490-439. Okay, so I show that her case is active in County 62, which is, let me see here. McLeod? Nope, McLeod, we're 43. Let me look at my sheet. Okay. Ramsey County. She's showing active in Ramsey County. Interesting, yeah. And her address says General Delivery, St. Paul. So I can give you Ramsey County phone number, but that's who you'll have to call. Oh, goodness. Wow, they actually, the last person I just talked to gave me your information as her being her caseworker. So she doesn't show anything within your case? No, she's never been in McLeod County that I can see. Has she ever lived in McLeod County? Yeah, yeah, she said that that's where she was at just prior to being here. Yeah, the case that I see, it's all Ramsey, Ramsey, Ramsey. Nothing's moved on it since October, but. October of 25? Yes, and I mean, I show she's active on food support in Ramsey County. Oh, damn, she's not even, so, yeah, there's, I guess, a major discrepancy because she's, right now, she's receiving GRH. And according to Stearns County, the GRH and GA was set up through McLeod County. Is there a different case number, maybe? That was the only case number they gave us. But I know that, like, if she's getting food support in one county and GRH in another, I don't want her to get in trouble. No, and that's weird. Let me see here. Oh, there, she's got two. I was looking at a different Janelle McCarter. There's more than one in the system there. Still spelled the same way? Like J-A-N-E-L? Okay. Oh, she was, I found it here now. So, she was at Integrations? Yeah. Yes. Wellness? Okay, and where are you now? She's at Place of Hope in St. Cloud. I can give you an address if that's helpful at all. Okay, yeah, and I don't show that she's active on GRH. I just show that she was getting cash assistance. Okay. And are you getting cash assistance? Yeah. Okay. I just don't have a card. Yeah, she doesn't have a card or anything like that. She'll have to call EBT to get a replacement card. Okay. But let's update the address first. Yes. Oh, yeah. So. Okay. So, what date did she move there? December 24th. Yep, December 24th. Okay, and what's the address? 511. It says 511 9th Avenue North, and that's in St. Cloud. And what's the zip code there? 5-6-3-0-3. All right. And is that Stearns County? Yeah. Yes, ma'am. Okay. And Place of Hope, is that like a? A homeless shelter. A sober house, or? Okay, got it. Okay. And then is there a good phone number? I've got two numbers on file here, Janelle. Are either of these good anymore? 320-243-1599, or 612-454-2345? No. No, she said no to both of those. Okay, we'll get rid of both of those. Oh, and then. Okay. All right, so we've got that updated. Okay. Yeah, do you want an updated phone number? Sure. 320-287-8169. Okay. All right, so what I'm going to do then is I'll transfer the case to Stearns, since that's where she is now. Do you guys want the phone number for EBT to request a replacement card? Oh, I got it. Yeah, we got it already. You do, okay. But if you could get us the phone number for the finance department, so they could help us get a document, it's like a reduced fee form, to help her get her birth certificate and state ID at a reduced cost. Well, I'm a financial worker and I don't know what that form is, but let me go ask one of the other girls and see if they know about that. Hold on just a sec here. Okay. Yeah, so if I'm in slow gear. Okay, I was just talking to one of our workers who's been here a lot longer than me. And she said that sometimes social workers can help you get reduced fees, like birth certificates and stuff, but there's not a form that I have. That's fine. You guys have a social worker at your place? Yeah, Stearns County. They knew which department and who to talk to. Okay. But that's fine. I was just- Go ahead. And then since she is in Stearns now, and I'm going to move the case up there, she should probably apply for whatever benefits she needs up there. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. And then, so by doing this transfer that you're doing right now, is this going to clear up the stuff that's going on in Ramsey County? Oh, I think I was just looking at the wrong case. Oh, okay. That Janelle was talking about. Oh, okay. I was just looking at the wrong case. Oh, okay. That Janelle was spelled with two L's. All right, I got you. Yeah, I was looking at the wrong... I found the right Janelle here that was at integrations. And... Yeah, that's odd. And it looks like- Oh, you didn't know them? Yeah. Oh, it wasn't- I already know that. We're all taking care of them for now, right? And is this transfer like, happen immediately? Like, are we able to call them? And like, is the case number the same and all that? I believe her case number will be the same. Because she's not in the facility anymore, I have to turn off the GA for February. So the case number is going to stay active. She'll have to reapply in Stearns. And then like, you know, to get her set up on things, she'll need like a medical opinion form probably, to try to get the community GA grants, depending on what's going on with her. But... Okay. Okay. It sounds like she's already got a bunch of that started. But... Okay. Okay, well, thank you so much. Okay. All right, have a good day. You too, bye.",

I had to put that RV in the shop. Oh, you did? Yeah. And, you know, Darnell, the one that work up at AutoZone? Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, when he followed me back to the building, he said, well, what was happening was the serpentine belt kept breaking. One of those tension pulleys or something that seized up in there. So as I was driving it, he said he saw a bunch of white smoke. Could that could have caused the white smoke, too, by the belt not being on there? Hold on one second. My Bluetooth is switching over so I can hear you. Yeah. OK, can you hear me now? Yeah. So I want to know what's really wrong. Well, yeah, I'm here. Now I can hear you. My bad. Can you hear me now? Yeah, sorry about all that. So you're saying you thought it was your serpentine belt? Yeah. No, it is the serpentine belt. It's one of those pulleys in there that keeps seizing up and it's breaking it. OK. And yeah. And so after that, the young dude, Darnell, said that he saw a bunch of white smoke coming out the tailpipe. And then all my antifreeze was going out that radiator, too. And then did you check your oil? Oh, damn. The oil, I just had got an oil change. So it can't be the oil. Well, I know. But one of the symptoms, if your head gasket is cracked, you know, the antifreeze will leak into the end of your whole head. Yeah, we know that. White smoke. And then also like the oil, if you check your oil after this happened, like it'll be. Oh, it won't look like oil. It'll look like sort of white foam. No, I didn't get it. I didn't do that. But you said you got rid of it already? Yeah, I put it in the shop. So when I find out what's wrong, I'll let you know. Yeah, you might have a cracked head gasket, which can be expensive. Like, basically, you got to replace either the engine or replace the head gasket. And both of those things are super expensive to have a shop do it. Yeah. I don't know. I'm going to let you know as soon as I find out something. Yeah, by all means. Whenever they're done doing their diagnostic. Yeah, let me know. Hey, by the way, I just got your name saved in my phone as AutoZone Van Guy. Could you, like, text me? Yeah, I texted you. Yeah, text me your name. So, like, because you're a person.

Underneath the date first, OK, yeah, click on that link. Amazing and this is the assessment. So usually on recommendations it's going to be all the way at the bottom.

How can I help? So, I guess I kind of was just talking with Red and, I don't know, one or two other people that are in the St. Cloud area, Stearns County area, and I was kind of interested in kind of finding, putting together something that, and this is like totally just me thinking out loud. I mean, I don't actually know your background at all, but I kind of wanted to put together a program that would assist low-income individuals with perhaps some dog training, some kind of course to get them, what's the term I'm looking for, personal, a service animal, you know, emotional support animal, like basically, I don't know, some sort of a community program that's just kind of a one-time deal. Anybody that's available or interested would be able to kind of, I don't know, get these services that I'm sure would cost money, but maybe you could tell me a little bit more about yourself. Well, I have therapy dogs, so they're registered therapy dogs through an organization called Pet Partners, and you have to go through online training, and then you have, your dog needs to be a good citizen, meaning they have to sit, stay, you know, they can't be aggressive, they have to listen, and then you go through an evaluation with a trainer to get your dog registered, and then that dog is registered to provide therapy to other people. That's what I do. I have a therapy horse, and I have two therapy horses and therapy dogs. So we provide therapy, so I go to the hospital, for example, and people, you know, that are in the hospital can find comfort, you know, and I brought my horses to the shelters with Red and, you know, people that, you know, horses are very sensitive animals, and they can really bring a lot of joy and a lot of peace to people. So that's that whole piece of it. That's called therapy animals. Emotional support, that is a dog that's for you, right, for your emotional support. The problem that happens a lot is people get these, I'm working in the homeless shelter, so that's kind of my perspective. People get these animals, and then they aren't trained, they don't have the money to vaccinate them, or they don't get them neutered or spayed, and then the dog misbehaves, and then they're struggling, because they're homeless. So yes, this is the pain point that I'm actually trying to focus on right now, because I want us to do something, and it sounds like you have direct knowledge of the pain point exactly. Yeah, I just spent this morning, I picked up a kennel for somebody that is at one of the shelters, and their dog is struggling. It's a puppy, and, you know, and I spent a half an hour doing some dog training, how to get the dog to sit without yelling, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit a hundred times, you know. I'm a dog trainer, I mean, I've self-taught and trained my dog, I've trained, I have a Border Collie, and I have a LabMix, and you know, I've trained some general knowledge, but I also have taken a lot of classes. So what we should do is kind of, you know, like, is there an opportunity to offer a dog class for basic training, like at Archangels? Could we do it? I'm sure Alex would probably support that, you know, like of an evening or something like that, where could we bring in someone that would be a, you know, dog, I have somebody in mind, I don't know what her volunteer commitment looks like, but could, you know, could she come in and provide some, you know, hands-on dog training and talk to people for free, maybe? And then the veterinary care, there's low cost, spay and neuter through SNAP. And also, Petsco has low cost vaccinations, and so it's still a cost, you know, but do we get, I mean, is there a way to get some funding from, you know, like donors that would want to donate some money to help people that need that? I don't know, you know, so that's what I got for you. So, yes, I can see why Red put me in contact with you. So you, I think that you are a very pivotal and important part of this process, that it could happen. And I would like to think that Alex would definitely support something like that. But I don't know, yeah, I just see, because I come from Minneapolis area, and, you know, Minneapolis area, I've been working kind of both areas, and it seems to be a very, very common problem issues where, like you just described, you know, I've never been trained or taught how to raise an animal or puppy. And you know, but these animals become like some sort of life support when somebody has close to nothing. Yeah, and that's, you know, there's that human animal bond that, you know, you just, it's indescribable, you know. But the problem is when, you know, the animal isn't trained, and then, you know, the people don't know what to do. And so they misguide the animal, and then they become aggressive. And then they bite somebody. And then, you know, that whole, it's not fair to the animal, right? It's really not fair to take a dog or a cat and have them if you don't have the means to care for them. It's just really not. It's not. So, you know, education up front for people, I know the shelters, you know, they do a lot of education and stuff, but, or like the animal shelters and stuff, you know, but just that, you know, if you're thinking of getting a service, well, not a service animal, emotional support animal, you know, here is the don'ts. Don't do this. Don't do that. You know, do, you know, do make sure you have money for the vaccinations and the, if they're not spayed and neutered, do make sure you have money to pay for food. Dog food's not cheap. You know, it's expensive. Absolutely. Yeah. You know, it was just a huge responsibility. And then it's, it's sad because the dog doesn't get trained. And then, you know, they get bad habits and anxiety and, you know, then, yeah, it's hard. But as far as service animals, that's a whole nother category. So service animals are a dog or cat, you know, an animal trained specifically to provide a service to the owner. You think of blind people have a service dog for seeing eye dog, that's a service dog, or somebody that's a veteran, you know, they get, they have PTSD and they're able to get a dog that's their support animal. But the dog or seizures, some dogs are trained to, you know, notify when the person may have a seizure. So those are specific things. But those costs thousands of dollars, because the training for that is not just good citizens, it's the specific training for the individual. And I understand in a situation like that, a lot of cases, like an insurance, their insurance will actually, you know, maybe even their insurance pays for some of that training to have that animal there. I'm sure there's programs. I'm not, but it sounds like you were very knowledgeable. And actually, everything I don't know if I record all my phone conversations. So actually, and it's just because everything you've said so far is just gold. And actually, I can tell you're be very, very, like everything that you said, I can put into an articulatable lesson, just based off of this conversation. I'm pretty tech savvy myself. And I, and I've got a pretty good background and I don't know, just kind of community organization, entrepreneur. This is actually a new field for me, being in the health field as a CPRS. You're familiar with the CPRSs, of course. No, I work with Heidi and Rachel. And yep, yep, they're awesome. You guys are awesome what you do. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. But yes, I definitely, this is kind of an extracurricular project I'm kind of pursuing. But I think that if I could get your text me or email and like your kind of first name, last name, somebody, ways I can get ahold of you and share your information on a professional level, I can kind of put together what I can find out more about what resources are available for us to make this more of a significant, concrete impact. Well, I belong to a group called Central Minnesota Therapy Animals. And it's a lot of retired people. I'm not as active as I'd like because I still work. But they go around to the hospital, the schools, colleges, and it's all therapy dogs that they do and bring their, so I can, when we have a meeting coming up in February, if I'm able to attend, I can pitch kind of, hey, we see a need to help people that are, you know, have service or emotional support animals, and they need some help with training, you know, how to make a good choice and see if our group has any resources. And then I have a person I can reach out to that she's a dog trainer, and just see if she would do any, like a, you know, a session to help people get started. I don't know if she does volunteer work, but we could ask. And then I have another friend that's a vet tech, and we could ask her. Unfortunately, there used to be a vet tech school in St. Cloud at Minnesota School of Business. Yeah. And they used to have students, you know, that needed projects. So this would be like a perfect project for vet tech students to try to help connect people. But that program was long since closed. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. We could, you could reach out to, like, Tri-County Humane Society and say, hey, I see this need for training, you know, people that have help training their dog for basic obedience that don't have, you know, their limited resources and stuff. And then, you know, probably part of it is compiling information and resources that you can give out to people, and then, you know, they can work from there. Oh, absolutely. And I, actually, I think I also might even have some other, I don't know who the state representatives are in this area, I guess, as far as, like, political representation, but it seems kind of far-fetched, but I don't know, maybe speaking to some of our representatives might be able to help us put together some sort of funding for something like this. Yeah. Yeah. So, I'm going to share my information with you, and I think I'm going to do some more research, and I'm going to get together with you, have another conversation with you sometime, maybe by the end of this week, maybe. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, just reach out. If I don't answer you right away, you know, just, I'll try to call you back or whatever, but I'll send you my email address. I'm going to send you my personal email, because I work for CentraCare, but this isn't really a CentraCare thing, but I'll send you my personal email address, and then my personal cell phone, and you can feel free to reach me on that versus my work, because I don't answer my work phone when I'm not working, or my work phone, yeah, when I'm not working, so. Okay? Does that work? Okay. Yeah, perfect. Yes. I'll send you in a text message, it's kind of like a link, and if you click it, it automatically saves my information into your phone, nothing to be alarmed of, but, and yeah, it was great meeting you. Yeah, you too. So, thanks for what you do. All right. We'll talk to you soon. Take care. I'll see you.",

    "transcript": "Can you hear me? I can. I can hear you. Yeah, what's going on? How are you? I'm doing okay. I'm doing more than okay. But how are you doing? I'm doing well. I'm typing. Yeah. Did I catch you at the end of the day? Or like, you good? Yeah, I'm good. I'm just waiting for my sister to come pick me up. And yeah, I'm just finishing up my work day. I really, really, really, really. Well, actually, I've been meaning to really kind of just wanted to reach out in general before the tonight, just to kind of see, make sure you're okay, because I don't know. I had no idea what was going on around you. And, you know, with this chaos and crazy stuff going down there. I was. Yeah, I just had no clue to know if you're like safe or not, or whatever. But yeah, I'm glad to hear you're okay. I'm doing well. I mean, I'll say one thing, at least about the chaos around us. It's just chaos. So I also like have my faith of humanity. And honestly, Minnesota raised me. So I'm just happy that everything's good. And all of our folks are safe. I think that's my main priority is that our folks are safe. Yeah. Yeah, that was honestly, like a huge concern. I mean, I tried not to worry, because that's not like, I learned not to worry, because it's not putting my faith in God. But I'm glad that you're safe. But I actually really wanted to, I don't know, I was actually just kind of puzzling myself over something that was kind of outside of my work duties. And I'm just asking myself this question. I was like, who is like somebody I could like talk to about this topic? That is just like way smarter than me, and could kind of, I don't know, make more sense out of how to approach. And you're that person. I'm honored. Yes. Okay, so I guess I could start with a pain point, I suppose, as how this whole interest started. But, you know, with Zach, you know, how the puppy, the dog, the whatever, and he got a dog, and he wasn't able to really care for it. And, and, and I guess that is a very common pain point in shelters and people with the homeless and low income individuals, they, they, you know, get into relationships with their canines, and not only they don't, they like lack the proper training and shots and knowledge, and, and to be able to be that, like, good owner. And I don't know, I just thought of it, there being like some sort of amazing community program that would be available for people to like, anybody that was interested to like come in and, I don't know, do some like dog training, like group dog training. I don't know what, I don't know what, what an event like that would look like. But that's kind of where my thoughts had started. And I had spoken to one of my clients about this interest, just thinking out loud, and he said, oh, you want to talk to this person. And he put me in touch with somebody that also works in the homeless shelter communities. Her name is Carmen. Oh, yeah, I thought it was a word called serenity. Yeah, no, well, so Carmen, I guess she works, center care, but I think she also does a lot of time, her job takes her into the homeless shelters. So she sees this, and she full full time, like trains, pet comfort pets, you know, like the pets that you bring into doctor's offices for therapeutic reasons. And so she, yeah, yeah. So she's, yeah, so she's an expert that like, you know, getting those animals like certified, and she knows the process, and she does that well. And I'm like, so glad that I record all my phone conversations, because there's no way I can take everything out of that conversation without having it transcribed. But yeah, I don't know, I see a need, and I don't have the knowledge in this field, this nonprofit, the fundraising. I'm kind of resourceful, but I guess I wanted to know, what would your, if you had come if you had come along this interest, and you wanted to make sure that it had like the best opportunity to provide all these tools and benefits to low income individuals, what, what would you do to kind of reinforce it or kind of build, make, I don't know, you got me? Yeah, like, what is the consultation of like, how an organization like this would be set up? That's, um, my first thought goes to one, do you want this to be for profit or nonprofit? Um, well, I guess I thought that I didn't kind of think about that. Like, there are organizations out there that kind of do similar stuff to this. A lot of them. Yeah. But I, um, I don't know, I guess there wouldn't be any profit in it. I think because there'd probably be a lot of actually funds that would have to be given or donated from higher up organizations or so. So the reason why I asked that is say for profit, um, example, I'll use a t-shirt as an example, say that you now have a branded t-shirt and Brandon Giles, you built the brand that for every t-shirt sold, it goes to supporting individuals that are homeless, uh, that would like to upkeep their animal care. Then that's my first thought process. So that, and then you could continue your work on another level. And that's why I say nonprofit to now donate your funds that you've made in your LLC through your organization to start the implementation process. Okay. So then you would have to build out a program where, in which like, if you're asking for money, anyone that has money is going to ask you, how can you prove the work that's being done? So then you got to think about data in that sense of like, either one, um, is there an intake process for every animal that's getting care? Are you also connected with a animal center? Right. Um, so then you could either be connected with, since you're a little farther out, it's a lot easier to connect with different veteran, uh, like veterinarians or like animal hospitals in that sense, because since you're a little bit in that rural Minnesota side, there's a lot more farmland on that side. So then building a like personal relationship with those folks. So then you're able to kind of get that work done in tangent with the veterinarians, because again, some of those things like the shots and everything has to get done at a vet's office. Um, so then that's the part I'm thinking about. The other thing that comes, you're recording, right? Cause I I'm not going to remember everything. Okay, good. Um, the other thought process that I'm thinking is like, in the sense of say a animal is now, um, sick, sick to the means of they might need to receive treatment for an illness or cancer in that sense. Uh, what is the process in which, or like even referral for the animal and the individual? And then at what point is also an animal considered safe or dangerous? If, um, so that's a little bit of like building a relationship with law enforcement, right. Or local law enforcement to those individuals so that if, and when something does happen or occur, then you can be, be a referral point from the law enforcement. Like maybe, um, example, if an officer knows your resources there, they can tell the person like, Hey, I know that there was a dog bite. Um, we're unsure if the dog has rabies in that sense, or even animal control, having those connections to animal control is another like business model piece I could think about. Um, and then there's the, the genuine piece of it. If you're going to do nonprofit work, um, I always tell people expect the unexpected, always expect to get broke because end of the day, the work that's being done in nonprofit world is honest work. I think I went on a tangent, but that's where my mind was going. You're amazing. I, uh, I know that I have to be respectful of your time. And, um, Okay. I'm waiting for my ride. Remember you are, you are still like in the cities. You're like not far away or anything. Yeah. Uh, my office is moved. So the office you had seen me at, I had moved over to the office next to Dearmon because my position had changed. I don't know if you have seen, uh, the posts that was made. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I did. Um, yeah, I wanted to start off by congratulating you. I think that honestly everybody that works in this company is super, super thankful for you guys and all the work that you guys do. Like they couldn't have found two better people to do the roles that they are, that you guys are doing. And that's, that's a really good thing. Yeah, it is. How are you doing though? Are you like staying safe and out the way? I hope you're not in the mix of any, any chaos. Um, that's true. The only chaos, the only chaos that my life really entails is, uh, just driving in Minnesota roads. Like, I don't know. Yeah, that's a dangerous thing, but I'm thankful that that's the only danger I really have going on in my life. Um, uh, but also, but aside from that, um, yeah, things have actually been going really, really well. Um, I, uh, take my, uh, my, my job very seriously and, um, yeah, uh, yeah, actually, I don't know. I'm just really, really good at what I do and I feel like I'm only getting better and I don't know. I guess I'm just thankful in a sense that, I don't know. I've, I think that God has always blessed me when, with, when I'm in a position like this, he always puts like the best people above me to learn from. And, uh, yeah, like Miles, Miles is like an awesome, he's like, I try to like keep it, obviously we keep it professional, but I would, I would, yeah, he's such a cool guy. I would, I would back that guy up in a fight, I think, realistically. Mood. I love that. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. But, uh, yeah, I was a little bit of a, uh, it shook my tree a little bit when AZAC was like, yes, you must transfer all your Minneapolis clients and, you know, be loyal to St. Cloud and Mora. And I, um, you know, it's not my, my needs or my thoughts, it's really the company's thoughts and what's the thoughts of the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. And still, I feel like there's been a significant improvement, uh, and just everybody, I don't know. I'm working with, um, they're the new primaries for the people that my clients were transferred to. Yeah. And, um, yeah, yeah. I, I know if I were to have a conversation with AZAC, I'd be able to report to them that things have been going well, despite, um, I, I did see that I had a formal write-up last week. Um, yeah, that was a little unexpected, but I, I don't know, we've talked, I talked with Miles about it. And I think that, uh, technically at some point since I uh, ended my leave, I had, I didn't immediately start off doing 20 hours. So I think for that reason, I got wrote up for not doing 20 hours, but my last week was over 20 hours. So, I mean, I know I'm doing good and, and moving forward, especially. Um, yeah. Yeah. I'm happy you're in St. Cloud. Like, Brandon, a lot of folks can learn from you more than you even realize. Yeah. You're a good peer. You're a good person. Yeah. I, uh, thank you. Thank you for that. I do, um, have my little things about me that make me unique, like my, my little techie side. I don't know. It's kind of interesting. Um, but, um, yeah, as I'm kind of progressing through at this and getting better, um, I'm also developing other skills that I have. But yeah, I mean, everything is about growth. It is. Yeah. I mean, ultimately, like I, my, I don't know if I actually mentioned this to like AZAC when I got hired, but ultimately my long-term goal with getting into this field is to learn as much as I can about this industry and, and like Excel and, you know, kind of whatever organic way. I don't really, I don't really foresee myself becoming a competitor because I, that doesn't make sense really, but yeah. I mean, like for your, your, your position, for example, you, you are a CP on this, but yeah, you have those skills that about like grant writing. I never was a CPRS. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you did have a certification at some point. No, I have a justice lived experience. Is that it? Yeah. I just remember you saying something about my clients in my case load. Yeah. But certain things. So I worked for almost a little shy of over, I want to say three years, two and a half. I don't remember. So look at my resume. I don't remember, but I worked in an organization with different LAGCs and LMFTs and LPCCs. So all, all the therapists come across a lot of therapists in the state of Minnesota that I've worked very, very closely with. I've learned a lot more in my 26 years than I have realized that makes sense. So I've been in most of the social services and for a while. And I think I told you before I've done research for a while as well. Yeah. Yeah. So the old job I used to work at, I did grant management and grant writing. And then a lot of consultation services that I provide is in around grant management and data. So like data equity, data analytics, all those cases. And those are services, like those are skills that you have developed. Do you actually, do you do, I don't know how you would consider that. Would you do freelance for another organization if the opportunity became available? Um, another organization can pay the LLC that I own. Right. That's right. Of course. Yeah. They can contract, they can contract me out via the org, but like me as an independent individual, like no. Right. No, I understand. You're, you're an LLC with those as I, yeah, totally. I love that business end of it. Yeah. Cause I've seen it before where individuals kind of take intellectual property. So that's why I was like, I'm a little protective on that piece. Yeah. You know, can I, um, I'm always a little reluctant about sharing some of my, my endeavors, my, uh, thoughts about the future with some of my employers, because it's actually, it actually hasn't gotten me, uh, well, I don't know what, what the, whatever. Anyways, that was a unique situation, but I, uh, I really want to feel like it's on, on my, on me to want to, uh, uh, this, this, this role just became known to me. That's called citizen developer. And, um, I don't know if you've ever heard of that before, but essentially they just like modernize, you know, companies and like improve, um, by like implementing workflows and digitizing things, like basically automating things. And yeah. And, um, I found out that, I mean, I have one thing that's helped me back from getting in the it industry is like, I thought that similar to like, uh, the contract here that like, if you don't have a degree in, in it, and then you have no legal, uh, you shouldn't, you don't have no right to practice, but I guess it's not like that in the it industry. You can actually practice without a license. Yeah. But I mean, the only competitive piece to it would be like, if you want to make yourself palatable to the next individual, certain certifications or degrees can like help you. Absolutely. And that's, and that's what I would be going towards as well. If I'm my next steps to make that like, uh, uh, income source or whatever, but yeah, I kind of want to be able to, because I don't know, my, my sister who's actually also kind of does the same thing. She does it like the same thing. Like she lives in Florida. Yeah. Like, I don't know, for example, sorry, go ahead. I was going to say, you don't need a degree for a lot of the work that's being done online right now, as long as you can maneuver and you have those skills, that's all that matters. Cause our systems are changing every day. Right. I think if you at least have the basics of like software engineering process, so like how to maneuver in the system when you're, you're kind of golden. Right. Yeah. I mean, I, I, my, my knowledge is definitely like really intense. Like I, I don't know, I, I, I interact with businesses and people and their hobbies and their, whatever they have going on super frequently. And then I, I, I see like ways that their, their system could be like improved so that it's like pain points or, and, and I, I don't know, but then I'm like still thinking to myself presently, like, like, for example, I had those, these thoughts when I went to the homeless shelters in St. Cloud, I was like, cause I seen that the staff there were very overwhelmed and like the culture was kind of rather grim. And, and I just thought of ways of maybe like, I dunno, just improving things for them that would make, I dunno, things more, I dunno, easier. Yeah. I'm pretty sure that place of hope still does all their intake, like, like by hand, like, I dunno, I don't, don't quote me on this, but they may be still be filing stuff in cabinets, which is great, but not practical. In the short term. Yeah. In the short term, but not logical in the long term. Right. But file cabinet is better in case they get subpoenaed. Absolutely. Yeah. For seven years. Man, I, I don't know. I wish I could talk to you more often. Maybe I'm in your position. I'll be able to talk, just share my thoughts a little bit more. Cause I actually, I'm gonna take my notes from my last conversation, that conversation earlier in this conversation, and maybe we can maybe just kind of email them to you. And I don't know what you want to call that. I don't know. I call that just a paper trail of the convos, but I would say keep the intellectual property for yourself. You have my consent on that and then see how you could figure out your model on that. Always create. Absolutely. Yeah. Oh, okay. I'm actually gonna, I'm getting back into St. Cloud for my last part of my day. I have just recently integrated rounding people up and going to meetings in the area. Okay. No worries. We can talk another time. You have a wonderful day. Okay. Yes. You too. It was great talking with you. I'll talk to you soon. You as well. See you.",

I'm just I'm on my way to pick up the second person to go to this meeting. And then I was also going to see if there was anybody available because Lou actually said that he needs a ride back from work. And I can probably still get him. But as I told him that if I pick him up, he's basically required to go to a meeting with with me. Right. Um, I am in for the night. I have my kid here. He hasn't been feeling good. So I'm not available tonight. Yeah. Okay, I got I think I got pulled over and figure out which address I'm punching into the phone. What meeting you're going to? Um, it's a Wednesday night one. It's an NA meeting. And it's the one on 601. West St. Germain. Okay. Yeah, Chrissy. Chrissy Riley runs that one. And I checked out the other day. And I really loved it. Nice. Good. Good. Good. Good. Are you going to go to the house meeting tomorrow night with me? Yes. Yes. I and that's in my schedule. And I thought that there was a there's also another mandatory meeting. That's at Archangels. Is that this? Um, I don't remember the date. It's sometimes. Yeah. But they're both this week, right? Let me look. And I took a picture of it. So let me look really quick. Oh, it is Thursday, the 29th at 4pm. So that's next week. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's next week. Okay. So okay. Yeah, we were playing phone tag for a while. Yeah, sorry. And so yeah, I was originally I was calling you about because I wanted to know more information about change place because I know that I've heard the that organization a couple of times but I don't know if it was like a good organization or if it was like lame and I should avoid it or I don't know. Um, so change place. The thing that I like most about change places they do board and lodge with partners treatment center and also Tara, her LLC counseling. And um, so that right there gets the clients rent paid for. That's a big, big plus and a big, big bonus for me just because board and lodge is awesome. They, they seem to have a good program over there. I have, I have one, I have one client there right now. I when I first started working, I had multiple clients throughout all their duplexes. Um, I mean, I, I like it. And so, because this is like my client that got that recommendation. That is one of his main concerns. Like he's pretty much his drinking got out of hand. He's not working and he's like ready to make any change that he can to get back on like the ball. And yeah, but I just wanted to change place. I knew it does do like lodging and all that, but I wasn't sure if like, that was like the, cause I heard that there was some new change that now a certain sort of, um, assist like assistance towards, uh, finding a place and an ILP like was going to be not as much as it used to be or something. I don't know. That change has already been made. I mean, there's, it used to be, you go to treatment, you get your sober house paid for through treatment for medical billing or whatever. They cut that off. And now, so the only place that really does board and lodge here in town is change place. So, and that's a different type of thing. I mean, I like it. I, I don't have any curls with, um, change place. And I have a good rapport with Vanessa, who is the, um, the manager for change place for the duplexes and the man's mansion. Cause there's another, um, what they call it, the man's mansion. It's close to downtown. Um, that's also changed place. Okay. The duplexes are for men and women. I think there's a one, one duplex for men and three for women over in that strip over on veterans. But I don't know. I, I don't have anything bad to say about the program because nope, don't start freaking out your damn dog. Um, just because, and that's, sorry, my dog, she's the mailman. Um, and that's what we have through very, very good communication or a knife. So, okay. Well, that's good. So then I think, yeah, everything you said was like really solid. And I think, uh, homeboy is going to love to hear all that. Yeah. Yeah. And they, I mean, they, they have a good program, you know, like you go to, you go to treatment and then you do your programming. And what I mean by programming as you have to go, I think you have to go to like three meetings a week or something like that. Um, they really support like recovery stuff. Like there's been many times that, um, I've asked if I could take clients to certain places. Like I took a group of people from change place down to the cities for a recovery night baseball game. And I wasn't sure if we were going to get back by curfew. I think curfew is like 11 or 12. And so I just messaged and I said, and she was like, yeah, absolutely. And she was like, you know, like, just let me know when you guys are on your way back so I can get up and do bed checks or whatever. And there was another time when we had game night at the building, um, for another client, I messaged her and I was just like, Hey, you know, um, such and such is here with me. We're having game night. I said, I'm going to bring them home directly after it's over. And she was like, oh, great. That's awesome. You know? So they're all about pro activities and stuff like that. So that's awesome. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, thank you. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna call this person that my second person I'm about to pick up. Sounds good. I'll talk to you tomorrow. Yep.",

I went to the store to get my laundry fucking quarters and milk, and I noticed halfway I left my damn phone, and I just was like, I'm not turning around. So the fucking one time, I actually don't turn around for my phone. It's okay. I think we might be a little late to the meeting, but it's totally good because I got to pick somebody else up too. Do you still want me to? First of all, I wanted to say I'm sorry. I didn't mean to seem like I'm pushing you into going to something you're not comfortable with right now. I don't want you to think I'm pushing, forcing you into it or whatever, but I just wanted to. I just noticed that may have came off a little. No, you're all right. I get it. No, you didn't come up inside the way. I will truthfully say I'm not entirely been sober, so I don't like to present myself in those just yet. And I know I probably should to get sober, but I. So I also wanted to say that, like, I sense that that could be like a thing, but I wanted to reassure you that nobody is going to be thinking about that. And I know it's out of my due diligence to risk. You know, I feel like I'm disrespecting people when I show up. And you're not. You're not. They want you here. Everybody wants you here. They love you. They love you here, dude. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I need to know. 601. They call it the library meeting. Oh, I've heard about that. Yeah. It is a meeting. Could we schedule for next week? We could. We could definitely. I need you here. I need you here for my emotional support as well. What does it change then? What if I need you? Brandon needs to Kota. Don't do that to me. I need you. Well, this is I'm new to the recovery community out here, to be honest. It's a good community. It is. It is. I felt great coming out here the other day. And I just, I don't know. I, I, I do have a few things I got to take care of. I was going to say, do you have your girlfriend? You got a girlfriend that stays with you too? Somewhat. Kind of. We're complicated. Is she there now? No. No, but that's what I'm getting everything situated. So, I shampooed my carpet. My house is literally a mess right now. That's what I've been taking care of all day. Laundry, fucking my house. And then, yeah. I, yeah. If it was planned out, honestly, if I had known a few days ago, I could have probably damn went. But I have this weird, I have this weird thing. I don't know. I just, I'm not ready. You don't have to apologize. It's okay. I apologize because I was like, I kind of like, hey, you should come, man. You're all right. But I was like, kind of rope again. Yeah, it is. It is kind of my sneaky way. I mean, I used to be a drug user. Obviously, I still like act like I am on drugs sometimes. Like, like all trying to con you into coming. I'm sorry. It's not, it's not like a ethical or like a professional way for me to behave. And I apologize for that. Hey, no, dude, you're 100% all right. You're drugs. Part of that unlocks a part of us that, you know, we didn't know before drugs. And that sticks with us in a certain way. And like, everybody has that little damn, like, dude, I'm even when I'm damn completely sober, I damn have my fucking people think I'm damn, you know, it's all right. Who cares what people think? Honestly, you know, but here's what I'm, I'm actually, I don't know if you've worked, you've worked with other CPR SS in the past, but I'll tell you, I'm not like the others. I don't know whether you're high, you know, honestly, I know for a fact that I know for a fact, some of the other people I work with are fucking smoked all the time, but it's not like, it's not my concern. I don't even think about it. Yeah. Whether you're high or not, like we're all about like, just being better spiritually. Right. And lifting each other up. And right now I'm, I'm bringing you your bag. Well, actually I'm picking up some other dude from work right now. Uh, who's like actually really close to where you are. Uh, so, and if I'm, so as I'm your sober friend, I am required to tell you the truth at some time. So am I, was that a good assumption? Right. So, I mean, I, I, I don't, everybody tells the truth. You know, I, I do my best to let down that, that barrier I put there to possibly tell a damn lie, but not to hurt anybody. Um, I just do it. So, well, I know I'm not casting any judgment or anything ever, but never will I ever cast judgment on you. Just, uh, just laying that out there. But, uh, what was I going to say? Uh, uh, what was I going to say? Uh, fucking shit. Oh yeah. The truth. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That's what I was going to say. And, or if this is your first time going to a meeting, like ever, which I, I don't think it is like anxiety. It's, it's, it's uncomfortable. It's not, it's everything's uncomfortable in the beginning. I was a big part of, uh, the sober community actually, um, through half of this year and then half of it, I just, you know, went back to bullshitting and them distancing myself because I don't like lying to people. Yeah. Yeah. Nobody's asking you to lie. That's what I will have to do though. If I do show up and I'm sober, I can't, I just feel disrespectful. Like if I'm damn standing there high. You're disrespectful to yourself. If anything, because, because you know, like it's your anxiety wins is winning the, at the end of the day. It's not like you're coming. You're new. You can't come because you're like, you got COVID-19. But yeah, you're right. Um, I promise. All right. All right. I guess. I mean, obviously I'm not going to let it force you into anything. I'm Susan or rape. You don't have to force me next week. Um, I got it. Yeah. Because I know I get it. So listen, there's this harm reduction thing. You know, whether you're sober or not, like as long as you believe you're in recovery, you're in recovery. And that's the way that works. You know, you know, you remember, you know that, right? Now I do. You know, you never knew that. No. Yeah. That's the truth. And that's, if you ask anybody, the like, Hey, if the person smokes weed, is that, are they in recovery? Do they, but I was an example, but yeah, that's the rule. Yeah. You know, you're like one of the younger guys I've worked with and probably one of the cooler ones I've met out here. And I will be slightly offended if we don't fucking spend some more time together throughout the week, but I get it. We don't have to hang out in my fucking office when, when we do things, you know that, right. I do need help. I do need help Friday. I need it. I need a ride to an interview if that's possible. What ride? Yeah. A ride to an interview on Friday. Yeah. I'm going to need a ride to fucking. Yeah. I do rides, but it's like, I mean, I could get somebody to do that. I'm going to, I got you. Yeah. Just don't just, I'm, I'm here to be, I'm here for you. And actually you should be like right next to me right now. That's why I'm on the phone with you still. I feel like I'm just actually talking to you out of my own anxiety. My bad. You're all right. I'll be, I'll be, I'll be meeting up with this guy here in a second. And yeah, just let me know when you're here. I'm going to get dressed real quick and I'll be on my way. Okay. All right. If, if I'm all right, once I leave, I'm going to punch your address and after I get to this place and if it's like, if I, if it is like on the way. Yeah. Yeah. If not, then I'll like try again in the morning or some shit. Yes, sir. Thank you so much. All right. I'll talk to you soon. All right. Take care. All right. You as well. All right. Bye.",

I just left a meeting, I guess you'd say. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I'm just lucky enough to be able to call that work. Yeah, so lucky. And so, yeah, so go about you continue with your grocery order. I said people you can give I don't mean to interrupt your grocery order. I just figured I'd give you a call because I don't know we're supposed to communicate. Yeah, last time we communicated you hung up on me. Maybe. All right. Well, I don't know. I don't work tomorrow. If you want to give me a call or something. You mean right now is not a good time. Well, do you care if you're on speakerphone? No, no, I told you to continue with your grocery order was fine. Did you still want to finish it or do you have more to add? Yeah, more to add. Okay. What does that entail? I don't know about all that. I'd rather if we're going to do that, like I want to be able to go to the store and get this stuff. I hate doing online orders. Yeah. You're accepting. Sorry, but where are you in the cities or something, Brandon? I'm leaving in St. Cloud. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I am. Yeah, just kind of I'm just doing my thing out here. Kind of making like some cool improvements and stuff like that. I guess you could say yeah. Are you going home? Yes, definitely. I'm going home. Yeah. Did you go home last night? Yeah. Yes, I did. Why? What made you think I didn't? I had to turn my Bluetooth off. It keeps connecting to my car. Did you go home last night? Yes. All right. Yeah, I was with Corey for like a while last night. Yeah, I know. He told me. Yeah. I might go pick him up tomorrow, I think. Yeah. That'd be cool. You need to rescue him from all the toxic females that has like plagued him. Yeah, poor guy. I feel I feel bad for him like because Corey, Corey was not built for toxic relationships. Like he's Yeah. All right. All right. Corey's a good guy. But yeah, I like Corey. Why do you look at me like that? I didn't look like anything. You look at me. I didn't look at anything. I was just talking. Oh, yeah. We know you like him like that. Yeah, no, I don't know if you like him for the same reasons that I like him. But we're working on that. I don't know what that means. Yeah. Yeah, no, it's okay. I adore Corey to just not the same way as you do. Eva. She just threw the cat toy on me. I got attacked. Okay, hurry up. Why are you adding so much stuff? I said add a few things. You're loading up the cart. That's because she knows what's up. You fat fucking chug. No kidding. I only added like $30 of I'm kidding. You can add some more if you want. I don't care. All of you guys send it. We have we only spent like $100 of this this month so far. I can show you like why I've ordered you like everybody in the past and maybe I don't know actually. I just I just have the kids adding what stuff they want and then I'm adding some shit too. Don't get don't go. Well, I trust that you I trust that somebody will not get all junk food. But I guess that's what they're supposed to be. Somebody's supposed to say that at some point, but I've been eating a lot of little Debbie snacks lately. Well, heck, you guys don't need to be drinking that much pop. You don't need to drink too. This was for feelings and he said no. Just type in 12. Are you already out of it? Oh, fuck you. Don't do fire. What? Yeah, I was joking. And I'm an adult. I can swear if I want to. Yes, I think she was using it. Yeah, here. Even though I'm only on the phone and we're not really talking I still feel like this is the most attention I've gotten in a long time. Okay, yeah. Hi, father. Hi, loving daughter. All right, what else do I need? Ice cream cones. Yeah. All right. Fucking bagels go with everything and then I already got those. Oh, what about pop tarts? At least the the s'mores variety and the I already got pop tarts. I already got those things. Um, what else? What? Oh, hey, dude, there's this Crave cereal. Crave. Yeah. Do you guys want Crave cereal? They don't want that. Oh, I want to get cereal though. Yeah, and you want to get Crave. Yeah, I forgot. The only cereal I really like is the Lucky Charms. Not Cinnamon Toast Crunch? I like those two, I guess. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, we'll get Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Okay, milk we need, don't we? No, Ella, you can't order porn from the Walmart app. Shut up, Brandon, not porn. I said corn. Ella, put him down. What are you doing? Oh, I just remembered I'm supposed to call somebody back that's just had their boyfriend, just caught their boyfriend cheating. Dad told me about that. Okay. Yeah, she's going through a rough time. Yeah. Yeah, it sucks when people cheat on you. What's her name? Cassie. Aren't you like in love with her or something? What? Nothing. I mean, that's a very, very platonic love. Okay. But yes, you could say that she is my comfort animal. My emotional support animal. I don't know. You get it. You get it. Yeah. I miss you, Barbara. Yeah, I miss you guys, too. You miss me the most, right? Yeah, you know, in case you're wondering, in case you're wondering, when I think about you guys, you guys are stuck in child form. So when I think about going to hang out with you guys later on next weekend, I'm thinking I'm going to pick all three of you up and you guys are all going to look at me with your big doughy cat eyes. You could have picked me up if you tried, bro. Dude, you know what? I have held you in the palm of my hand like you were a fucking like a... I don't know. What do you hold on to? I don't know. A turkey. Yeah, whatever it is, I managed to put it all in my hand. All right. I think we have enough. I don't really know what else to get. I'm going to get some Halo Top ice cream because I can eat that shit and not gain weight. Why are you worried about gaining weight? Because... It's winter. Winter time. Yeah, it's going to be summertime, though. Oh, you don't get it. You're a boy. But with that being said, I am the smallest I've been in a long time. That's because you're such a hard worker and you do everything for this family. I know. Well, I've never lost any pounds. Except for calling me when I want you to all the time. Whatever. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Actually, me and some of my comrades that I used to hang out with, they all were kind of thinking that maybe dad did include mom in things kind of a lot. I include you in shit, too. Oh, yeah, like ordering groceries? No. Don't be dramatic, Brandon. It'd be... Maybe I... You're dramatic. Fucking talking about your fucking hips or whatever the hell you were just saying a second ago. I wasn't talking about no hips. Man, I got bunions. I do have those, but... Oh, my gosh. I can't help it. I don't even know why I have them. I'll pray for you. Bunions. You know what? Actually, I'm going to save my prayers for the guy that was sitting next to me in the meeting because that guy, his bunions are so bad that he's not going to be able to make it to the meeting tomorrow night because he's got going through surgery. Specifically for bunions. And yes, he was black if in case that matters at all. Don't be wondering. No, I'm sorry. I will repeat it whenever we get out of the house. Okay. Well, I would just like to thank you guys all here for inviting me to this event. I do miss you guys. I do love you. And yes, Kiana, you do look amazing. Thanks, Brandon. Yeah. And if you want to give me a call later, I won't be hostile. All right. Sounds good. All right. I'll talk to you later. All right. Bye. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Uh, hello, this is Brandon. Hi, this is Saison with Northstar Regional. I was returning a voicemail. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't get that. What'd you say? My name is Saison with Northstar Regional. I was returning a voicemail we received. Oh, yes, yes. Um, so, um, yes, I'm, I'm Brandon Gillis. I'm with, uh, Generation Hope. And yesterday I was calling on behalf of a client of mine, uh, Matthew Marcellus. Um, he recently did a CD assessment through, uh, Sobriety First, and I believe they may have forwarded his assessment on to you guys. And we were following up about your intake process, um, and had some questions about your, like, some of your IO, IOP. Okay. Um, you wouldn't happen to know how to spell his last name or his date of birth, would you? Um, yes, I can give you that information in just one second. Oh, okay. Okay. Um, first day it has, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, first day it is, um, 11 three 1989. Did you hear me? Okay. Uh, okay. It looks like we so we have a chart for him, but it's from 2023. So we haven't received anything recently. Um, well, we have, we have an act we could send you over the CD assessment anyways. And I believe that your organization does fall on his and his, uh, recommendations. Um, and no, sorry, go ahead. Oh, I was, I was going to say, um, in regards to your question about like the admission process and, um, for our intensive outpatient lodging, um, for that, if we, you know, we're to receive the assessment or even without the assessment, uh, depending on what kind of insurance he has, um, we would just ask to do a phone screening as possible with him. It takes about like 15 minutes and that just gets, um, some background information for his chart. And then, um, depending on the location, we have three locations and Chaska Eden Prairie and, um, if he had a strong preference for one, we put him on that waitlist or put him at that location. If there was an opening, otherwise, um, if he had no preference or was able to go to any of the three of them that does, um, make it a quicker placement quickly. But, um, if there is an opening, then we're able to pretty much just go move on to that step unless there's like a tentative discharge date that we're aiming for. Um, and then if he needs to go on the waitlist, then we would just stay in touch with either you or both of you, um, in regards to any movement on that list. Okay. Um, so let's see. I think that, um, maybe I could put you, would you be okay if I put you on a brief hold and I got him on the phone? So if we could, uh, cause I'm pretty sure I'm going to advise to him that we at least, uh, do the phone screening while we're all on the phone and you get put on a waitlist so that we know that we have that option available, but we're, I'm gonna be with him like in the next half hour anyways. So I can, if I could just put you on a brief hold, I can put him on the phone. Yeah. All right. One second. Sorry. Thank you for your patience. I am. I don't know if it's super obvious or not, but I'm still driving on my way. Okay. All right. Cool. One, all right. Just one second now. Okay. Are you still there? I'm still here. Um, yeah, he, oh shit. He's actually going to have to call me back. Uh, that's the first time he's ever, I've ever tried calling him and he didn't answer. Um, so I actually have your guys' numbers saved. Is it 952-297-8665? Yes. Okay, cool. Um, I'll give you guys a call and this is your direct line. Um, that's our admission line, but, um, any of us can help you or, um, if you ask for Cezanne, then I can, um, or you can be transferred to me as well. Okay. Are you at like a specific facility that you're calling me back from? Oh, no, we're, we're just, that's the admissions line. So we're all admission. I got you. Okay. I'll, I'll give you guys a call back as soon as I can get him on the phone. All right. Thank you. Of course. Thanks. Yep. Bye.",

No, you're good. Wonderful. How's your week been? Uh, it's been pretty busy. You know, yesterday I got, I worked for 13 and a half hours, so, you know, definitely longer than normal. But, you know, it was good. You know, I got to go to this thing that was like a men's meeting and it's run by active and former Ramsey County judges. And so it's like kind of a men's meeting and kind of like a support group, but also kind of like a networking thing. So, you know, I look forward to, you know, going to that more in the future.

    "transcript": "Other calls: Heidi Austin @ 11m 13s Hello, this is Brandon. Hey, Brandon, how are you doing? I'm doing good. I'm just gonna check out right now. Okay. What happened? Is your daughter okay? Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's fine. I'm good. Thank you. Oh, thank you. Sorry about that. Okay, so I'm good now. Okay, yeah. Yeah, I'm just getting into town and my waiting for my first appointment to like get back to me, but you can hear me okay, right? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Well, just kind of pick up where we were before, man. Oh, so you're still there? Okay. Yeah. Just pick up where we were before. If anybody hasn't told you this, man, like you're super awesome, like hard worker, like it sucks that we don't get to post that example like on Connect Team because you definitely should be recognized for that amount of that level of dedication is what I'm saying. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I do take pride in being a dedicated and loyal, you know what I mean, worker to the people that I interact with, you know, for sure. So, thank you for saying that. Yeah. Now, to put you back in that supervisorial role, I noticed that if I were to say overall my performance is great, things like good things are happening all around, but on paper, I have a noticeable late reporting issue that I've been fucking struggling to kick. Okay. And I would just like to communicate that I'm noticing that in my behavior and yeah, fuck. Okay. I mean, how many, you know, you have a bunch of late notes right now or? Well, I mean, like, no, there's like all my notes are submitted. Like, they're not like open. None of them are open still, like, or not complete. It's just my goal has been to, you know, report the day of and I just been like, so well, the last couple of days, I've I've, I usually like work my normal hours, but then I'll leave the area, go home. And then I'll come back in the evening to go to like a meeting. And I'll bring like some clients to the meeting and that by doing that, it's been, you know, it's been getting me more connected with the like recovery out here in St. Cloud. And, you know, it's also duly helping me get more hours. Yeah. So, but generally, and I guess the issue is like, when I, when I get home after that, you know, my, my kids like super miss me and I miss them. And I wanted to like, give them a little bit of attention, but still get my reports filed. And, and then it turns into like, I'm doing it like last thing, like right before midnight. And, and then, and it's yeah. So, I mean, they all end up getting completed, but it's like, like maybe completed at like 1am or some shit like that. Okay. Yeah. I mean, I, I understand life happens. I mean, I think that sometimes we're trying to juggle different balls, right? Like one of them is, you know, the ever present, you know, like need for the 20 hours and, or hopefully more than that, but, you know, you know, showing up which in a practical sense is showing up your clients when and how they need it, you know? Figuring out how to get the notes done is, you know, part of the battle, but that's a little bit more controllable, you know? And I think that, you know, the, the bigger concern would again, just to be continued to, you know, get the appointments done, um, you know, period, um, and continue to like, you know, um, follow up with the ones that you've been both assigned and, or the, you know, new referrals as they come, um, how, how has that been going for you? Oh, definitely. It's like, um, I'm onboarding. I've been onboarding like crazy and that's going super well. Like I've been, uh, yeah, like I've onboarded somebody who just became billable yesterday and then I successfully completed the onboarded and submitted CD assessment for somebody, another individual yesterday. Um, so they're like, I'm assuming going to be going through Danes today. Um, and then I have this one person that I've onboarded and I'm, I'm, I'm not letting them go. Like I've been so on about like, dude, we're doing a CD assessment. Like I call him, I, I buy him, I stop out and I get him breakfast, uh, all the time to kind of make sure that he's, uh, knows that he's cared about and, but I can't like extend myself further than that without that CD assessment and all that. That's, uh, and then, uh, so with that, those are the new things that I know, new clients I've been working on. And then I also have, uh, um, I think two people that are already like, uh, on my schedule that I've been working with and that's been going well. Yeah, really well. Okay. Um, good. That's good to hear. Um, have you heard or been able to make any progress on those? Yeah, they'd be, um, of the, those clients that you thought were billable that weren't. I did. I did talk with, uh, Chrissy Riley recently about that. And I, and, um, and basically I was, uh, we, through a conversation I had with her, it, uh, I guess I'm not the first, the, I'm not the first person to tell her that, uh, her, uh, she's like basically just outside of, uh, the requirements allowing us to work with her in that realm. Uh, so I kind of like, just, I think I, this is like half text conversation, half in person. I told her that, like, um, like I'd like to remain friends as in a, in a recovery community of sense. Uh, you know, and I congratulated her on her uh, near two years of sobriety now. And, uh, basically just told her, you know, I wish I would have been able to work with you a little bit more hands-on when, uh, I, I had, had her billable. So if there's anything that I could do to help her in the future, please let me know. Um, and that's, um, where that is. Okay. Um, so should I make her, her inactive then? Yes. Yes. Uh, you can make her inactive. And I was actually about to say, I've been, I've actually requested this one individual to be marked as inactive, uh, named Craig Peterzak, but, uh, through some chance of randomness, I actually just ran into him at, uh, Salvation Army when I was picking up a client yesterday morning. Uh, and I told him, I was like, Hey, how you been? And, uh, you remember me? Like, let's get like, let's connect and, uh, we'll go from there. So I guess I'm going to try to reach out to him again. And, uh, now that I know where he's at and he kind of remembers me, maybe that will be a place to pick up on onboarding them because he just needs his CD assessment done. Okay. Okay. So, um, but yeah, that's a really good, really good. Um, I'd have to say as far as like, if I were to be having a conversation with Azak and cause I know he's got very firm, got very firm, uh, expectations of what my activity should be like out here. I feel like if I were to have a conversation with him, I'd be able to tell him that I made a very positive impact out here and, uh, my, I should be like near, yeah, I'm consistently improving and reinforcing, uh, improvements with interactions and the hours that I'm accumulating. Yeah. Um, are you, are you still checking in with and, or seeing Heidi? Oh, absolutely. Okay. Yeah. She, well, she's there. There's no doubt that she is, she may not be my supervisor, but she's my team lead. So yeah, yeah, for sure. She's way smarter than me on some things. And I, uh, yeah, the experience. Yeah. Yep. Definitely. Okay, cool. Yeah. I'm, I'm glad because you know, she's definitely the, you know, the, uh, the go-to person, you know, in that area. So that was, that would be who I would be seeing, working with, referring to, et cetera. You know, she's calling right now. You want me to add her to the call? No, nope, nope. I'll just let you go. Yeah. Answer her call and I'll just talk to you later. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Hello. Good morning. Hello. How are you? I was just on the phone with miles and I'm kind of just waiting for my first appointment to get it back to me. Um, but, uh, what, how are you doing? Good. So, um, is your first appointment a billable client? Absolutely. 100%. Good. Cause we need to have you start focusing on billable people. I have a client that I have, um, fully onboarded. I pulled him out of one of the sober houses last week when I went there. Um, and I onboarded two of them and I'm going to give you one of them. His name is Troy and his last name's like, I can't pronounce that shit, but I already talked to him this morning. He's an older gentleman. Um, he's going to need to start working or find a job. I'm trying to get, I'm going to be emailing this, um, guy about the MET program, which is kind of like what Red does. He volunteers and he gets paid for it. Um, but I told him, you have to be old enough. Um, I told him, um, that I was going to let you know, but I'm going to put him on your, um, I'm going to put him on your caseload right now as you as primary, and I will send you his number. Um, I'm sorry, I'm talking, I'm clicking as we speak. Totally cool. Um, so that will be another, he'll basically be like a full-time client for you because he's going to need, he's going to have a lot of needs. And out of the two people, I feel like you can, you will be able to help him most, um, between you and Rachel, you know what I mean? And so I'm going to send you his number right now. I'll send it from, uh, I did that to send it from my work phone. So, no, don't do that. No, don't do that. Shut up. I just had a whole argument with myself. So I'm sending you his number right now from my work phone. There you go. Um, but I would just reach out to him today and see when you guys can meet up to do like the initial meet and greet and then also wellness plan. Okay. So you've not, is he just on boarded or like, have you met with him a couple of times? Nope. I just got him billable on Tuesday. Oh, so I still have one more time to do the one or two more times to do the recovery wellness plan before I, well, technically, yeah, but it's a good habit to start doing it like the first meeting or two. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. So, um, thank you. Thank you for that. Um, what do you got going on today? Like, are you super busy besides our mandatory meeting? Uh, we don't have mandatory. We get, we're going to the sober house tonight. Okay. Um, yeah, I have a bunch of miscellaneous **** to do. Yeah. I was going to run something past you. Um, it's kind of like, um, I don't know. Yeah, something I started doing with I had to do with somebody else like as far as like kind of keeping my notes together and like, uh, I know that, uh, you're a little bit more old school versus I'm like a little bit more techie. Uh, I, uh, started doing this thing recently. That's like **** actually really cool. And I was just going to show it to you and, yeah. And I see if that any of any aspect of that seemed to be helpful. Um, and I'm going to, I'm going to see if that any of any aspect of that seemed interesting to you. Okay. Well, um, you can show me, I'll be in and out of the office all day. All right. I'm just going to pull up to the office right now because I'm not going to drive around town waiting for my appointment to call me back. He's must've slept in or something. Right. Well, if anything, reach out to Troy. Absolutely. I'll do that. No sense on lacing your time. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. All right. I'll see you shortly. All right.",

It looks like there was a third degree assault and was wondering about the context around it. And we used to be incendiary. Are you talking to me right now? Yeah. Say that again. I'm wondering about the context on the third degree assault and the use of the incendiary. One more time. I apologize. Hi, this is Lydia. I'm training Katrina here. So we just have a quick question on the intake that we did. I think it was today, my colleague, it was the zone that you were speaking with. And it looks like we just needed a little bit of context on the third degree assault. Like what happened, we kind of want to know your story about that. Oh, that was from like 12 years ago? Yeah, you're referring to his criminal thing, incident like 12 years ago? Is that what you're talking about? Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess what sort of questions do you have about it? We just want to know your story behind it, like what happened. The only thing that happened was I was closing the door behind me. And the person's hand got caught in between the door. Because they're trying to stop me from shutting the door. And I didn't realize it until they already booked me. Okay. So, I mean, that's essentially what happened. That's the reason why. I just planned to do it anyway because I was already trying to find a different case at that time. So, but yeah, that's essentially what happened. Oh, okay. So, why is this thing? Incendiary device, what is that? Is that like the door is what they mean by that? Probably the door, yeah. Incendiary device? Incendiary device, I don't know. Oh, like blowing up. Is that what the? No, there's no. Fire. That's right. There's no, there's no explosives or anything involved in that case. All right, then. So, do you have time so we can do a quick phone screening with you? Absolutely. Yeah, this is that time. So, I'm going to get Katrina to just ask a couple of questions. I'm right next to her. So, it's just training here. And she can take over. We just needed to ask that. Okay. All right. She is ready. Okay. Have you ever been an employee of Narsha Regional? No. Do you have any family members currently in programming with Narsha Regional?

And looks like there's a packing limitation of one bag and one backpack. Do you agree to this? But as long as I can keep it in the vehicle, I guess that wouldn't matter. Right. This is for outpatient programming, right? This is residential. Okay. Yeah, I think our recommendation was for an outpatient program. No problem. You guys do have an outpatient program, right? Yes. Yes, we do. Yes, we do. Okay. Do we need to speak to a different intake person for that? No, you're fine. We do both. So, what is your chemical use of choice? Alcohol. When was the last time you drank? This past weekend. Last weekend? Yeah. Was it on Saturday or Sunday? Sunday. Okay. Any other substances? THC. When was the last day to use? About three days ago, four days ago. Was that Monday or Sunday? Monday. How did you use it? Just a bowl. Any other substances? No. Do you have any allergies? Sorry, what was that? Do you have any allergies? No. Do you have any dietary restrictions? No. Are you able to climb stairs? Yes. Do you use any mobility devices? No. Do you use any medical devices? No. Do you have any history of seizures? No. Do you have any history of overdose? No. Are you taking any medication? I am, but I won't be bringing them with me.

No. Are you your own legal guardian? Yes. Do you use any alcohol monitoring devices? No. Do you use any GPS monitoring device? No. Okay. Okay, Matthew, it's Lydia again. I'm over here. So due to, I know you want to do IOP with lodging, but due to your last date of use, your insurance will not be able to cover it. So you do qualify for the residential treatment. All right. Is that okay with you? Are you willing to go to the residential treatment program? I think that as long as we do the phone treatment, phone screening for today, because we did have some other people that we had to follow up with. We did have a couple of other questions for you as well. Okay. What is the question? So just to summarize, so you said that based on the answers that he gave you today, you think that he would not be eligible for an outpatient program, but he would be inpatient? Yeah, for residential, that's correct. Okay. All right. My next question would be, you guys did receive the CD assessment from sobriety first? It looks like from what I'm looking at in this year, we have not received it yet. Was it sent today? It would have been sent on Friday. It would have been sent Friday. I don't know how you guys usually send them out to you if it's like fax or email, but they did automatically send it to you already. We can send you a copy right now if that would be helpful at all. Perfect. If you could do that, that would be great. We have a fax number or email as well. Okay. What is a good email for you guys? Yeah, email would be best. And also, if you could send an R01 so that we could speak with, my organization can speak with you guys in regards to Matt. Perfect. Yeah, so usually once he admits, he signs all the forms from you guys. Since you guys are referring him to us, we will have that document ready for you guys, and then we can put it on there. And whenever you guys need to speak to him or speak to the counselor, we'll be able to release this information to you. I have an email whenever you're ready. Yeah, go ahead. Okay. Email is admission. So, A-G-M-I-S-S-I-O-N-S at northstarregional.com. So, N-O-R-T-H-S-T-A-R-E-G-I-O-N-A-L.com. Regional.com? Yes, that's correct. Regional.com? Mm-hmm. Okay. One second. Let me put you on just a brief hold, and I can send that over to you. Okay. And I'm speaking to Brian, right? Brandon. Yeah. Brandon? Yeah, Brandon. Generation Hope. Okay. Generation Hope. Okay. And Generation Hope, is that like a sober house or just curious? Generation Hope is an RCO. It's a recovery community organization. We're based all over Minnesota. We have an office in Minneapolis and then St. Cloud and a couple of others throughout the state. But we're mainly an organization that offers certified CPRS services. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Awesome. Oh, yeah. So while we're doing that, we do have a couple other questions while I'm pointing and clicking and things are loading. Okay. So assuming that we – well, once we do get that recommendation over to you, in that outpatient program, he had some questions about, like, the rules and some of, like, what's allowed and just kind of safeguard himself from potentially breaking rules or, I don't know, he doesn't want to set himself up for failure. So he was asking questions about, like, what your guys' policy is on having his vehicle there and, like, does it matter whose name it is in and, like, what that sort of – some of those information like that. Okay. So once he arrives at the facility, there is a parking space where he can go and park. So everybody at the reception area, they will tell him exactly how to – where to park and everything. Most of the rules is just to make sure that you follow, make sure you attend all the programs. The rules are just easy. Main focus is just attend the program when we have them. And then you do have individual session. You have group sessions as well. There is, at that vehicle, there is a gym where there's, like, downtime as well. So just make sure you bring things to keep you busy, sketchbook. They have a gym, other things just to keep you busy. But the rules, I feel like it's just straightforward. And everything. And they will have all of those information for you to sign up. And at the end of the day, that is on you. So we can't have our phone with us? Is that something you guys take? You will – yeah, so you can take your phone, but you cannot use your phone during the sessions. So it will be kept away for its own safety, because you are there with other guys there as well. So whenever you need your phone, you just need to ask a counselor and then we get that. Do you guys do, like, store runs or anything like that? Because if I need to, like, go to, like, Walmart. Yes, we do have store runs, yes. Okay. Yes, they do have store runs where they get everybody to go. Well, not everybody, but particular people to go to the store, like gas stations and other places to get what they need. Okay. And you guys don't require, like, proof of insurance or anything like that on the vehicle? Or can you just keep it on the lot? Insurance? Right. Insurance. No, not that I know of. That has not been a problem for us. Okay. Any other questions? No, that's it. So do you actually – so does the program, is it just a couple of days out of the week and then he's free to go? Or how does – it's like every day? You're going to be there – it goes up to six weeks of program. It goes up to six weeks. So depending on how well you're doing, you can graduate earlier. And if you want to continue, that's when they will put you on the list for IOP with lodging. And the IOP with lodging, that goes up to nine weeks with three phases each, which is like three weeks each phase. And once you graduate from that and you want to go for a sober home or just, like, be in the community and go IOP, straight IOP, you can do that as well. So it keeps going, you know, so it's like a step down. So you graduate from this, you decide to go further, continue under that type of program. Okay. Are you there? Yeah, yeah, we're still there. I was just trying to – oh, there, I think it's – we're having a little – I'm kind of new to the system that we use. Okay. Send us a fax number as well, too, just in case. Okay. No, definitely email is going to work. One second, though. I do actually – I just got to it, and I'm going to send it in a second. I'm going to put you on a brief hold, though. No, go ahead. Okay. I just want to make sure I got the email right. It's loading screens. Okay, so it's admissions at northstarregional.com. Admissions at northstarregional.com. Is that right? That's correct. Okay. All right, I'm sending it over right now. Yeah. Yeah, this should be in your inbox in just a second now. Okay. Also, it should be coming from an email that's like legityellisatlive.com. It's not like a company email I use or anything. Okay, we received it. We're going to work on this, and then we'll give you a call back. Jeff, to let you know, we'll call you back to see if we can schedule when he can come in, okay? Okay. But it would be just so we're on the same page. So once you guys receive that, once you look at that and you see that the recommendation is already for an outpatient program, that's what we'll be talking about, right? Not an inpatient program? Yeah, so from what we were saying, I know you guys recommended outpatient, but because of his last date of use, he used not too long ago. So because of that, he won't qualify for outpatient treatment. For outpatient treatment? Yeah, the insurance won't cover it. Because he just used not too long ago. But he does qualify for the residential treatment program. So you guys just want to look at the assessment and maybe get back to me? Yes. Okay. All right, that sounds good. I look forward to hearing from you guys. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.",

Like, I could actually just, you could call, talk to me, text me or whatever when you're good and not like driving dangerously. No, I was just in the parking lot. It is dangerous. It is so dangerous. That's why you want to back up. Yeah. Yeah. Matt, you said that you had already started online. Yeah. I already completed that. Is it Jen? Jen? Yeah, Jen. Or whatever. Okay.

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Through Partners? Yeah. The CD assessment came from Sobriety First. That doesn't matter. They should have, I've already been in connection with Partners and they should have received. Put on your seatbelt. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm on the phone and that dinging really bothers people. Partners pays for Sobriety First for housing, which changes Sobriety First says not. Right, right. So if you're going to be doing treatment, then I would choose Partners. If you're trying to live at Change Place. Okay. Does that make sense? A little, a little bit. I think so. So just to repeat what you just said back. You say that Change Place. If we're interested in an IOP program with lodging, then we start our admission process with Partners. So call Partners. Yep. Call Partners. Yep. Yeah, I'm good Partners on that. Okay. And you can have them send over your assessment from Sobriety First. Yeah. So then you don't have to do another assessment. Okay. Yeah. And then we just tell them that we're interested in getting on to the change of place with lodging and process. Yep. Okay. Yep. All right. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome. Bye. Bye. Bye.",

Hey, Brianna. This is Brandon Gillis with Generation Hope. How are you doing? Great. How are you? I'm super busy over here. Yeah. So I'm actually I got Matt with me today right now and we're kind of playing a little bit of phone tag a little bit but my supervisor would kind of explain to me a little bit how we're trying to get him into change of place and we recently did the CD assessment over at Sobriety First. And I made sure that he did the ROI for between your guys' organization and Sobriety First and ours and Sobriety First. But my supervisor said in order to get change of place, change of place and take going that we should actually talk with you guys because you guys are somehow connected. To change place? Change of place. I can give you. Yeah, I mean, I can give you their phone number, their application. We can, you know, if it would be helpful, like this is for his last name's Marcellus. Yeah. Correct. Okay. We can I've processed his intake. So are his referral documents. So we'd be able to schedule him for intake if that's helpful for change place. Yeah. But, but it's you and the client will have to be the ones who are proactive to get him signed up. But we cannot, we can't do that for him. He has to do it based on like laws and everything. I think we'll change place right now. Like I think they're like, when we look at our housing, we're looking at, this is in St. Cloud, right? Yeah. St. Cloud is like a hard, hard area because there's a lot of housing going on there for like a lot of options. Let me see. So while you're, while you're doing that, maybe you explain how you guys, you are connected to the right or to change a place like this Heidi was kind of. Yeah. We just have them on our housing list. So like we don't, we, we are not connected, like not connected in any way to housing. Yeah. Not directly. Like we have a housing list and you know, like we, yeah, refer back and forth, you know what I mean? Like we have a context information but we, we, partners is not, does not work with, with change place. Cause I did all that the other day. You what? Yeah. They're online application. Okay. And you didn't hear back. Yeah. It looks like. So the Fernie and our housing team, they have reached out to change place just to see what their numbers are at. I know yesterday there was like two female beds open and zero male beds. The screen, the housing team reached out to them and they haven't heard back. The other options for St. Cloud, so is it only board and lodge that he can look for or like, cause I have housing list for GRH. I just don't know what he, like, would he qualify for GRH? Well, his CD assessment, maybe, maybe it could be a good, do you guys have that already? His CD assessments that says what he is approved for? I have to, so I have a sobriety first assessment. I just don't know. I don't know enough details. Like if I look at that, I don't like, I can give you, like I gave him the board and lodge stage place, but I do have housing list for GRH in St. Cloud, but I just don't know what he, if he qualifies for that. And I don't know if you've like tried to apply for that with him or if you know, know more than I do with the housing piece of it. Right. Yeah. We've been on GRH or anything. I guess he was looking for like, just like IOP, like a couple of days a week. And then something that would also kind of help put them in like a sober living situation for however long that programming lasts. The other, the other, so he filled out an application with Change Place, is that correct? Yeah. Right. And, and does he have to stay in St. Cloud? No, no, you can go wherever. If he were willing to come to the cities, I'm probably there. We have a lot more access to resources for housing resources. We have a men's campus, you know, in St. Paul or one in Minneapolis that has available spots. If, if maybe he'd be willing to come to the cities. Okay. Like, Yeah, we would definitely be open for, to hear what availabilities are out there. Yeah. So let me, can I send you a housing list for the cities? And then if you want to figure, try calling those places here. And then we, because we got him scheduled, I can get him an intake here very quickly, like in, at the men's campus or, or Minneapolis campus. I just, you know, with the, the housing, you need that secured housing. You're not going to go to, if you don't have somewhere to live, right. Let's see. So the number, I can send you an email. I look, looks like I have legit gills at live.com. Yeah. Legit Gillis. That's the right one. Yeah. Yep. So I can send you a housing list. Another number I was given this morning for St. Cloud, because I was having the same issue with some deals, was, it's called Victoria Plus Housing Home. I, we're not a hundred percent sure what their, what their funding is, but, so if you go to the website, if you just Google Victoria Plus Housing St. Cloud, and then I have their phone number, it's 320-471-8912. Damn, that was fast. Say it again. Oh, sorry. So Victoria Plus' phone number is 320-471-8912. Eight, nine. But I, I'm not, yeah, eight, nine, one, two. I'm not sure what, what their, their pay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. And so this is where I find them. They're funding it. And then the other place that I was shared with, which is dream center, which is when I look at the website looks a little more like a shelter to me. But those are the three I have for St. Cloud, but yeah, if he's willing to come to the Twin location, I can provide you with board and lodging. So that sounds like you've got a lot of information in front of you and that's super helpful. If you can put that all in an email and then kind of just simplify things for me, like, so do we need to find one of those places first and then get back to you and then you get us on into the intake process or can we do one the other way around where we start with you and then later, well, the decision versus is whether, like, if he can come to the cities, you know, like that, that opens up a bunch of spots, right? Like I could schedule him and take call to get him an intake today or tomorrow. But if he doesn't have somewhere to live, like that's not going to be helpful, right? And then he would have to do another, if he ended up coming to the cities, he'd have to do another intake. So I guess like focusing on which area, like where, like I could do an intake either in St. Cloud or, or St. Paul or Minneapolis, I just need to confirm which location he wants to be at. Okay. So if, if it's more, if, if you want to call this afternoon for these, these, those housing that I'm going to send you in the cities and then you're like, yeah, he can come to cities and you know, we can go that route. I get it. Yeah. So if you could actually put it all that in an email, because he's communicated with me that he can't make a decision right this second, he needs to discuss it with his partner. So yeah. Okay. An email. Yeah. Yeah. Like less than an hour. Yeah. And then I also, you know, like I, that will change place, like even if they are full, like I like to be put on a, maybe on a wait list, like things change super fast and so for houses. Right. So I don't like, it might just be the day they might have opening throw. I don't, I don't know. It's kind of, you know, kind of up in the air, but let me, I'll send you an email. I'll send you an email and give you all that information. And then kind of, then Matthew, yeah, I can talk to a partner about it and see what the best route is. I just want to make sure that he's safe right now when that he, well, he figures this out what he wants to do. Well, I figured we'd look in the same cloud. That's, I'm already here. So it's like Jamia makes more sense. We'll figure out where they have availability. Okay. If they can get me in right away, that we can, we can get him, give me in right away. If there has to be a wait, we'll, we'll, we'll, you know, have to determine, can I wait? Right. Can I wait? Or could I, or do I have to go down to the cities? I'll talk to them. Yeah. Okay. I'll talk to my partner today and see what, see what she wants to do because she's down in the cities right now. So. Oh, that might be, that might be perfect for you. We'll, we'll see. Cause I know she wanted to come up here, but I just don't want to be like, you know what I mean? Yeah. One of those things. Okay. Yeah. So I can, is it better for me to email you or email Brandon? Probably Brandon. Brandon will be keeping the reins on this for right now. And then, yeah, we're working together on it. So. Okay. All right. All right. I'll send that stuff over. You and I, right? Like a gen hoping and you're in partners. Do we have an ROI already set up or do you want to add to the email? For partners? I, with Generation Hope, that's a good question. Let me look. Yeah. Cause I know if we don't have one set up yet, like we're going to need one. So if you throw that in an email as well. Right. Right. Actually, the thing is, cause you referred him. So it makes it a little bit more like, that's why I'm able to talk. Let's see though. Otherwise I can have my intake lady get in touch with you. I mean, that's, that would be. Yeah. Or, I mean, I kind of send it to you by email too, to have you sign. But I think. Yeah. Yeah. Let me, let me take a look. What I have on. Yeah. Cause we're able to coordinate until basically after your intake. Like that's just because you were referred in the hot spot. Yeah. Yeah. We have one. We have one with, with Aaron from sobriety first. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. We can eventually have one that, but like, because what it's just. What we're doing is just that, you know, we're not really exchanging any information. You know what I mean? Like we're okay for the moment. Before the ROI. You just. Once, once, like, let's say you have your intake and you do your assessment and if you wanted Brandon to get a copy of it and stuff like that, that's when we would need the ROI. Okay. All right. Well, great. Okay. I'll drop that and get it out to you. Okay. Okay. I'll be watching. Thank you. Okay. Thanks. Bye.",

She's also kind of in need of her own PCA, but that isn't really our like responsibility at this point, too. So you'll get that. You'll get the hang of it. But she's a CPA or she she she talked about his mom. CPA PCA is what she was trying to set up for herself. But that is. Yeah, that has nothing to do with us at this point, I guess is what I'm trying to say. But. Oh, yeah, yeah. You feel free to like get to know her and Zach. And just know that Zach's on her couch right now. And I did share his location with you, like where she lives. OK. You know where that is, right? The Huntington. I didn't hear. Where? Huntington Place Apartments. Oh, where are you? I let me I live like on Glenwood and Cedar. I live in the North Side Art Studio. Lost. Glenwood and what? Glenwood and Cedar. Yeah. Oh, OK.

Actually, I'm going to meet with Miles tomorrow at 10 a.m. So you don't want to send it to him with a note. And then tomorrow when I'm in a meeting with him, we can figure out exactly. And then he can either send him to me or keep him or whatever, you know. For sure. All right, man. And then let me know if there's anything else I can do for you. All right. Thank you. All right.

    "transcript": "has been forwarded to voicemail. The person you're talking to is not available at this time. Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah, what are you doing? I'm in my office right now. Dude, I'm freaking out. Okay. I need you to keep this between me and you. The only reason why I'm telling you is because you're the pure recovery coach person. Yeah. Okay? If you don't tell anybody, the only reason I'm even telling you, you're the only person who knows, is because you're the pure recovery coach and I'm going to put that down as a person. And I fucking went to Walmart today, right? And I went in the store, I went in there for one thing and I had Cisco with me, which is Diana's kid, who's like six. And I had Baby with me, who's four months, you know? So I parked in the front, first handicapped parking spot to the door and I ran in there for one thing and came out, it was like five minutes, I'm telling you. It was five minutes, Brandon. And I come out and the cop that runs that store was outside of my car, right? So the initial reporter or whatever person who called, called 911, so I was sent to the dispatch thing. So the original officer who was even supposed to get to the scene, didn't even get there before I came out, right? So they wrote me a ticket for child neglected and child endangerment. So you're saying, just so I understand, the Baby was in the car with another person? Oh, so two kids in the car? So two kids were in the car? Yep, two kids, a six-year-old and my son. Somebody went to see them in the car and called the cops. And I was in there, Brandon, for five minutes too. And so they wrote me a fucking, they wrote me a ticket and they're going to call CPS on me and shit, I already told my worker. And I talked to her about it for like 10 minutes, this all just happened, like an hour ago. But I called my worker before anybody could, just to tell him, I was like, look, dude, I didn't know it was a big deal. I didn't know that was, like, I thought I was, when he was, the cop was yelling at me, okay? And I'm like, why are you yelling at me? I'm like, I was in the store for five minutes. There's another, you know, I didn't think that, like, I didn't think that, like, I don't understand if it was, like, maybe a fucking newborn in the car, but like, there was a six-year-old there, you know? I don't know what I was thinking, I guess, but I wasn't, I didn't think that it was, like, that, that big of a deal. Right. So, I wanted to start off by saying, I'm sorry that that happened. And I know that being in that situation is, like, totally gets you jammed up, and you're not really sure how to react. React? Dude, I fucking, I, like, I fucking, I don't know, I'm so sick right now. Like, I'm so sick, I could just puke, dude. I feel like I'm gonna puke. I just want you to know that everything's gonna be okay. No, it's not. Like, dude, there's a CPS shit with CODA open. I'm ready whenever you are. And it's like, I don't know what to do right now. Okay, so, are you listening? Yeah. All right, this is what I want you to do. The proper way that you need to behave in a situation like this is not to freak out under any circumstances when having a discussion with these people. You always just, like, accept, like, don't get on your defensive. Just assume that, like, Oh, I'm not defensive about it at all, you know? Like, at first I was, like, at the very first time I walked out the door and he started yelling at me. I'm like, what the fuck are you yelling at me for? I didn't, like, realize it was that big of a deal. Like, I'm like, dude, he's in there with another child. It's not like it's cold in there. It's running and warm, you know? I didn't know it was that big of a deal. I, like, so, like, my reaction to what he was saying was like, dude, what the fuck? Calm the fuck down, pretty much, you know? I feel like an idiot for even doing that. Like, I didn't know it was, like, that, you know what I mean? Okay, I understand. Like, I couldn't figure out why the fuck he was, like, yelling at me. I'm like, dude, you're yelling at me for something that's, like, not that big of a deal, but it is a big deal, I guess. It is. It's, like, one of those things, people that leave kids in the car a lot and they, it's a deadly thing, and you're a new parent, and I wouldn't fully expect to think about that or fully connect that to what you're doing right now. Like, you don't think that your kid's gonna die by running into a situation like that. Hey, is this it? Sorry. That was me in my bag, cleaning up the bed a little bit. Oh, you're okay. So, did that happen in a different county? Where did that happen at? Happened right down the road from my house, in Brooklyn Park, Walmart. Same county that you're, this case, that's already activated then? Yep. Well, the good news is... They already told me that they're gonna call and report it, and so I just... I don't have one on my... I might have a regular one. The good news... Oh, shit. There's a brush. I only have a minute to talk before I was, before I actually got a... Oh, my bad. But I was gonna say, the good news is, if there is any right this second, that since you already have an open case, they're not gonna open another case. So, as long as you communicate that, like, hey, this happened, you're gonna get a notification. It sounds like you already did that. You're like, I'm so fucking sorry. I told her before that you did. Right, yeah, and I'm just, like, always be cooperative. I was, like, fucking indistracted. I, like, couldn't even bring myself to talk to her. Yeah, you don't... So, like, one thing I want to, like, kind of want you to keep in your mind, as far as, like, strategy and tactical, like, whenever you talk to that worker, like, you need to always present yourself as extremely calm and, like, cooperative and, like, ready to move forward. If you can keep it, like, as simple as that, like, you don't ever let them catch you up, like, don't ever lose your temper in front of them, don't ever freak out in front of them, because, like... I was freaking out when I talked to her, like, melting down. Yeah, that's, uh... Well, I mean, at the same time, it's like, I'm like, dude, this dude just told me that, fucking, you guys were gonna come take my kid, like, could take my kid from me, you know? Yeah. Like, you know, I told her that, he said that to me, so I, you know, I don't know. Um, by the way, also, if you, if you tell your, if you tell your worker or your probation officer that you're working with me, then it kind of implies that... David, I'll be right back, okay? Thank you so much, I'm sorry. Okay. I was gonna say, you gotta let me know when, if you're gonna tell them that you're working with me. Okay. Yeah, it's up to you, uh, if you're gonna tell them. Should I tell them that this, this incident, should I tell them that this incident is what kind of made me decide to get a peer recovery coach, because they don't think that they're addressing the problem. They know I still bleed, I told them that. You know what I mean? Yes, I mean, you haven't admitted to any, like, drug use, right? Because, what, they suspected? No, I did admit to smoking weed, and I admitted to using when I was younger, but being sober for, like, sober for a couple years, obviously, and then, I told them that I still bleed. But I also told them that I'm on supervised probation, and my probation officer does random U.A.H. trainings, and that's not an issue. Um, yeah, I mean, I think it would be a really smart play at this point to, to kind of be like, okay, I think with all this commotion, I'm gonna get, like, a C.D. assessment done and start re-evaluating things. And if, if you tell them that you're making, taking these steps, like, they, those are the things that they want to hear, because they want you to be, like, a healthy parent. And if they hear you making those steps, and then, like, those, that's what's gonna keep them in, in your favor. But I gotta super encourage you not to, like, lose your shit in front of them again.

And then, I got a Zach on the phone as well, and I'm ... Oh, shit. Yeah, I got Zach on the phone as well, and I guess he woke up, and he's all talking to me about wanting to go out and walk around in this cold-ass weather, so I was like, pause. Like, this would be a perfect time to give Will a call, because who knows, I don't know if you're even around or available today. Zach. Yeah. Pay attention. I am. The dog just broke into my mom's room. The dog broke into your mom's room. That sounds amazing. So, yeah. Will, this is Zach. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Will, this is Zach. Hi Zach. Where's he going? Zach has the attention of a goldfish, but bless his heart, he is still trying. Yep. No shirt to remember either. Yeah, so Zach, what are you trying to do today? I have to get beer outside before he fucking does an accident. And then go to the store for my mom. And then, anything else? Probably, with the time that is, if I'm getting in the right, I could stop by coordinate entry, front door. You said coordinate entry, front door. That's off of like 17th and Chicago. I think they close at like 4. Yeah, I think so. That can't happen. Because actually, I'm just about getting ready to go pick up a client and do some running with them. And then, so that's going to be like probably about 5.30. I won't be available until like 5.30. Where then, at that point, I just have the time to meet up. If I'm in contact where going to the store for my mom can take some time. Why don't you wait to do the store thing until you meet with Will at 5 o'clock so that you don't get in the wrong place. 5.30. That's like two hours where I could definitely be available at that time. For sure. Well, the big deal is, I just wanted to introduce you guys. Because you guys haven't actually had a chance to meet yet, right? Yep. Nope. And I still don't have his number. It's on my phone, but I can't. My phone, I did get it charged. I need to get a wireless charger. Get the charging port cleaned over. Okay, I will. It's what it says on the fucking indication is that it's wet or debris in the USB port. The USB port is de-activated. I got you. Yeah, we can figure that out. But that's why I put you guys on Facebook together. Because it's a little unorthodox. There's a Facebook friends group thing with people that we're professional with. But in your case, Will... You're professional? Yeah, yeah. Actually, Will does have a certification. So he's required to follow certain rules and stuff like that. But it's his decision. I was rather than you. Yeah. You actually caught us in the middle of lunch. So are you going to meet up with... I'll let you talk with Will. It sounds like Will's on his way to meet a client right now. But try to coordinate with him and don't get lost in space. Do you give me a fucking Butterfinger? Kit Kat? Let's go do this. Kit Kats are for people that wake up on time. All right, Will. I know you guys don't really know each other well. But if you guys learn to give each other some shit, it'll work out. All right, Will. If you have any questions, let me know. Otherwise, I'm here any way I can help. All right. Yeah, it should be all right. You got your hands full. Yeah. All right. I'll talk to you guys soon. All right. Thanks. All right. Bye.",

I'm just about to check out on my little cell phone thing. I was going to see you. Do you ever actually decide you wanted me to add you to my family plan? I don't want service. I just wanted a phone. You know what I mean? One that I could pay off. Yeah. I don't know. But it's not the service you were interested in. Well, I mean, it is service because you have to stay through the same service that you buy your phone through. Mm-hmm. So it would be service, too. But I mean, I don't want to open up a phone plan because I'm just going to go get one leased to me. You know what I mean? To pay it off. So you don't like the phone that you have now? No, it's all fucked up. It's really bad. And I only do Apple. Yeah, there's this plan. All right. So if I were just, well, basically, I don't know, you can use the phone plan and I can send you the Google store, but you can really just use any and you can get phones on there like payment plan-wise. But it'd be like you doing it. It wouldn't be like me financing it. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sorry, I'm giving the baby a bath right now. Oh, you're fine. Okay. All right. All right. Well, I guess for now, I'm just going to let you do the shopping or figure that out. But I'm going to add my phone number real quick. Okay. Thank you. I'll call you back. All right. All right. Bye.

Well, sorry I woke you up half hour early. I just have a question. Yeah. Okay, so you remember the day that your truck broke down, right, at AutoZone? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Was that the same day that you, Zach, and Zeke and I went to that dock thing? No. No? Down by like the river or whatever and I fell? Actually, it may have been because I just remember that day I dropped you guys off and I saw Zach. Zach had to get back. Yep, he had to get back and then because his pass was up or whatever and then you had to go get the boys. But did you come back that same night? Well, do you remember where I dropped Zach off that day? Hell no. Well, it could have been the same day, actually. Yeah, I think it was. It was like October. Like, I don't know. I couldn't tell you the day. Why do you ask? We're just trying to get on the same page here. That's why. Yeah, you want to know the day exactly? I could tell you when it was. I could tell you where we were. Okay. Okay, yeah, because I mean, I know what the dock thing that he's talking about, but like, I just, was that the same day your truck broke down? That's all. Yeah, maybe I'll find out. Okay. But did he drop Zach off that night? He just asked me where he dropped Zach off. I knew where he dropped Zach off. I was like, I don't know. I mean, like, because I know where I dropped Zach off that night. Oh, I thought he, yeah, Zach got off, or got out with us. Yeah, that's kind of why I asked. We all got out at T's. Yeah, if that's what happened, then it wasn't the same day, but I could tell you where we went that day. I'm just going to look at my phone. No, like the dock, like down by the river? Yeah, I remember. I know what you're talking about. Yeah, that was after like 26th or something. Yeah. Okay, so then the day after, was that when your truck broke down at AutoZone? And you were asking T? Okay. There's a silly, stupid thing off my phone. It won't go away. How do I make that thing go away? Hold on one second. No, it was my phone. I think she had all of our phones. Yeah, she had my phone, because I gave it to her afterwards. So nobody left their phones at home. Yeah. Cece was the only one who had her phone. Oh, I was getting hot. I don't know. I don't know. He's looking. I'm telling you exactly what day it is. I can tell you exactly what day I don't know. The day I got mad at you, I just threw you out. It was Wednesday. I just thought that you were in. Yeah, I'll call you right back. My phone's doing something stupid. I'll call you right back. Okay.",

The fit was my birthday, so she didn't understand. Yeah, since we went to the store the other night. Yes, she did. Early in the morning. Yeah, I did. This time? Oh, no. It wasn't even my birthday yet. It was like October. Right. Well, you said the fit, so... I said... Wednesday was between... See, this is our debate here. Yeah. Are you laughing? I don't know what you're talking about. You know, she's waiting on the confirmation. Of the day the truck broke down. That was a Thursday. Oh, my gosh. I'm telling you. That was the only day I was able to get that extra time out with him. That was the day I called you in the custody line and I was walking all the way back to the fucking green place before y'all made it to me. The next day was Thursday. Friday came. No, no, no, no, no, no. That was a different... That was a totally different auto zone. That was St. Paul. The first auto zone, that's the day... It was right here. That day, it actually broke down. Wait, no. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no. No. Hold up. Hold up, B. The day your truck was over here off of Broadway and it broke down. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, he needed his... Yeah, that day, so... And you were talking to other people. Okay. I think I got it. So, it was... Not the St. Paul auto zone. Fifth or something. Matter of fact, I can probably look it up on the phone because... Okay. Okay. It was the October 17th is the day that it happened. Yeah. On a Wednesday? It was because... It was that day. It was October 17th. That was the day that that girl got bit. So, it would have been Thursday, the 16th. Okay. It was... Okay, so go back a little further when you needed to tease Jack. That was in two days. Oh, yeah. That was different. That was different. Yeah, the auto zone off of Broadway. Yeah, yeah. That was a different occasion. That was like... Yeah, that was like a week before. A week before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, it was. It was not too far apart. Yeah, I can tell you when that day was, too. Because the day I signed up for your program was on a Wednesday. And that's where I was actually just going to look, too. I can look at your information and find out when you signed up. Shut up. I wasn't talking about that fucking auto zone in St. Paul. I wasn't either. I let you do your whole thing, right? Would you stop now? I'm talking about this auto zone where the fucking studio at. That's where I keep staying. I never said nothing about St. Paul fucking auto zone. The day that we signed you up for services was 9-23. The day you were in my office was 9-23. Yep, it was on the 23rd. Yeah. And I can tell you where we were on that day. You picked me up from my house. Yeah. Right? Yeah, yeah. Now, I'm going to refresh you. He was out here two days in a row. The second day he was out here. No, it was. I'm going to remind you right here. The day I met with you and that shit was when I got the extra time through my PO. You talked to my PO on the phone, right? Yeah, yeah. He gave me to fuck. And I was over my past time to be back. So, we extended it. Right? He dropped his back off my knees. You went and picked your kids up. That's when you told Zach you had to go. And Zach tried to take all day. Zach left with me. Zach in the dollar. And then, right? You said. So, you think that we signed you up? I said, Zach in the dollar. We all left. And then he said, you'll be back here either Thursday or the following week because he was out here all week. Right? The next day. You catching me? Yeah. The next day. On Wednesday. I thought I was going to actually meet up with you and we was going to go over the goals and all other shit, right? You called my phone to get a hold of Cassie because her phone wasn't working. Yeah. To borrow Jack. Yeah, that is the day. I was I was stuck. I was on. It doesn't say I was on. It says I was a fucking cub, but it doesn't say I was on that day. I guess. Yeah, but you're on. You're on Broadway. Yeah. I was calling us from like two something to fucking four or five something or whatever. Right? Yeah. To the point where I got on a skateboard and kick push to us to the storage place. Right. That was I think it was a different day. So I can tell you what day that was, though, because I met a certain person that day that I remember. That was the next day. You think it was the next day? I know it's the next day because that was the only other day I had free time to go and fucking do the storage move with him. And you call my phone to get a jack from T because your car was broke down. Is that road a skateboard all the way up to public storage to borrow the jack when we was coming down the elevator? He was coming on the elevator. Yeah. Yeah. It says I was there. I was there at eleven fifteen to twelve. Yeah. Yeah. Told you. You get to midnight. Yeah. And that was the night that you told me. I'm walking to AutoZone to me. Exactly. And I was like, damn, they still stuck in the parking lot over there. Ain't nobody going to help. And you said we're about to find out. You kept walking past and you said it goes back and they're going to be. And you said, oh, I'm like, oh, what the fuck are you going? You're going out. I'm going down here to this building. I want to check something. I can tell you exactly what you told me today. And then do pop up bushes on your ass and scared the fuck out of you. That's not like I don't like you walking down Broadway at a certain night because, you know, you can't trust nobody around here. It ain't a control where you're going. It's about your safety. You can't help you. I can't help you. That dude that was in the bush. Jumped up the fucking night for a concert. Hey, come here. Grab you up. What can you do? That was my heart. That's why I really got to. I got to get off the phone. Get a little bit of rest. Yeah, the baby's up. I mean, you have a good day. Stay warm, guys. Yeah. Don't forget to brush your teeth. Thank you.

Um, let's see, I've got a, I've got a client that lives right next to you. Like, on the other side of the bridge there. And, um, he called me and he's trying to get, I guess he's got some important dentist appointment he's going to this morning. And I'm already, like, about to leave for work myself. I was just gonna see if you were around. Wouldn't mind getting mad at me for some reason. Like, going out in the cold and helping this guy out. I'm not going to do that. Okay, that's totally fine. He is really super close to you, though. Okay, that's fine. I'm not going to go out. Yeah, that's probably a safe thing. Okay. I would like to catch up with you soon. Can I tell you all the good things that have been going on, but I'm just about ready to get out of here. Yeah. Yeah, well, tell him to stay home. Okay. That's no problem. I'm going to text him. All right. So, how have you been? What's that? How have you been? Oh, I've been pretty good. Yeah, pretty good. Pretty busy. Yeah. Yeah. She's been busy. Yeah. Going to meetings regularly. I have a girlfriend moving in with me pretty soon. Yeah. Yeah, I see you posted something on Facebook about that. Yeah. Yeah, she is. Yeah. You know, I was going to ask you if you ever go to any meetings out in the St. Cloud area at all? No. Meetings in St. Cloud? Yeah. No. Yeah. No. Yeah, I've been going to meetings out there for the last couple of weeks. Yeah, it's kind of my way of kind of getting more into the recovery community or area that I work out there. Yeah. Oh, that's good. Yeah, I was like going back and forth working between here and Minneapolis in the St. Cloud. But my employers said that they need more help out in the St. Cloud. So I've been out there for pretty much the last two months. Yeah. You're staying busy, huh? Staying sober? Yeah, super sober. My truck got wrecked. You've seen that, though, right? It's on the side of my home. Yeah, it's on the back side of my spot out here. Yeah, I don't know. It's like an eyesore. I kind of figured everybody in town has seen it. Yeah, that's pretty much the worst thing that's happened in the last couple of months. But... That suburban area got wrecked? Yeah. Yeah, the tranny went out, and then it got vandalized. And that was pretty much one of the last days I worked in the city. Since then, I've worked out in St. Cloud. You got another vehicle, right? Yeah, me and Gabby have been sharing a vehicle. She is doing her school now, so she hasn't been going to work. So, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I was just talking to Crystal recently. And it sounds like she got her driver's license for a car. She just needs to pass her test to become a CPRS. Yeah. I think... Crystal? Yeah. Oh, yeah. It sounds like her last little milestone is just coming up with the money. So, I think I might just borrow her the money. I feel like it's kind of a good investment. Yeah. Oh, you're going to go out and drive? Yeah. Yep, I do. I was honestly thinking about taking one of my sons to work with me today, too. But I don't know. I guess just kind of get ready, finish getting ready, and see. It was pretty cold yesterday. Minus 28 degrees or 20 degrees or something. Yeah. Yeah, last night it was... I had to pick up my girlfriend from work at 9 o'clock. It was 19 below. Yeah. At what time? I picked her up at 9 o'clock last night. Oh. I'm going to be going over to pick her up. She still lives in Recovering Hope. And I'm going to go pick her up this morning and bring her here. We just moved in a bunch of our stuff. And there's boxes fogging up my living room. And we've got to sort through all that, get her things put away. That's what we're doing. And then we'll probably go to that meeting tonight at the Manor. That Friday night meeting. Yeah. Well, actually, on Fridays, I think today I'm trying to get out of work a little bit early. Because I've been working a lot lately. Yeah. Let me look at my schedule, see if I can make it back in time. It would be nice. I can bring back my buddy. My client, he lives, like, right in the same neighborhood as you, basically. But I just onboarded him, like, last week. And I think I'm going to bring him to a meeting out here. Because that's basically what I do out in St. Cloud. I run all these errands for people, help them get housing, find work, get into treatment. And go to meetings. If anybody that I find that's around and answers their phone, I take them to a meeting. Yeah. Yeah. Meetings are good. Yeah. Yeah, we can talk more later. I've got to get my stuff together this morning. Yeah. Okay. So, catch up with me later. All right. Sounds good. All right. Have a good day. You too. Bye.",

I gotta tell you, I don't know, I think I mentioned this when you first asked me, but typically since I'm not your primary person, I guess Rachel is your primary person. Okay. So I guess the proper etiquette, and I'm learning this because I don't, but you're supposed to basically go through Janelle and she's supposed to give me permission to take you to this thing. Okay. And I kind of, we're kind of going a little backwards, so right now I'm talking with my bosses and trying to make sure. Well, like the thing is, is I can never get a hold of Rachel. Like I can't, like anytime I need something or whatever, I can never get a hold of her. She'll like text me like four hours later. And I need to, I need to get up to the social security office to get this thing taken care of. And now I fucking can't get a hold of her. Have you talked to Heidi? Yeah. And that's what I'm learning right now. I just, nobody's told me that I could. And right now the boss, the boss of all of us is like looking at it. She said, Rachel is his primary. And yes, you should. I reached out to her though. Rachel isn't able to help clients prior to 1230. Okay. So, so, so then you're not, you can't come then? I'm like 15 minutes out of town, but I've got something I'm doing right before your thing. Did you see the invite? I updated it because I'm running fucking late. It's like now it's from 10 to, yeah, it starts at 10. Oh yeah. Because what's her name? She can't, Rachel can't even leave the house until 1230. You know what I mean? And I like, I want to get this shit done. So I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm going to ask, I'm going to ask to switch to you somehow. I don't know. Um, yeah, I, I don't, I don't know how that, how that conversation goes. I, I, I don't know. I'll figure, I'll figure it out. You don't have to worry about it. I mean, I'm the one that's receiving the, receiving the care. And if I'm not, if I'm not receiving anything, like if I can't plan anything with her and I can't get anything on my needs met, then how is that, how is that effective for me? You know what I'm saying? Right. And I, and I, it sounds like that's what the supervisor is saying right now. Like he's, she's agreeing with you. So in a roundabout way, she's giving me permission. Oh, okay. Cool. She is giving me permission. I just, uh, I think that, yeah, I don't, I don't actually know the answer to that question. I just think that I could get in trouble for talking to you about it. I don't know. Maybe. Oh yeah, no, no, no, no worries. I won't say nothing. I mean, it's between me and you. Yeah, yeah. And I got your back of course. And uh, I just want to be able to help. And actually that's where this whole thing started from. I just, uh, I'm learning that there's like proper office etiquette. And um, and I don't want to talk to anybody. Yeah. Absolutely. Right. I don't, uh, think I mentioned this until, I haven't mentioned this at all, but I, uh, have a, uh, what do you call this?

Thank you for letting me know. Hello, this is Brandon. Hello, this is Heidi. Good morning. Good morning. So, I, we already discussed this last night. Yeah, yeah, you said you're going to talk to him. Talk to him. That's all I remember. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to take him or not. But I'm going to talk to Nick on Monday, and just kind of sit him down and talk to him about, you know, like, is he with you? No, no, he's not. Okay, just talk to him about, you know, like what a CPRS can do what they can't do because he's the one that asked Rachel to go get his coffee cup, and that's why she couldn't be available for him. You know, like, those are not recovery needs. Right. And so, yeah, I'm going to have a chit chat with him. But I will do that. Okay. Yeah. Also, and then also him asking me to do the same thing that he's asking you to do you know what I mean like crazy. Yeah, I guess he's not since he's not my client I don't really have an opinion. Right. Right. I don't know. I just wanted to make sure that I didn't. I don't want this race off I don't want to get. No, you're fine. Goodness. Crazy. I told him like in the future you gotta, you gotta like go through the training command before you come to me, because I can't, I can't tell you yes, and, and he said that he was like kind of bothered by, like, I don't know what he has. I guess Rachel told him that she wasn't going to be available before 1230. She's not what she told me as well. So, it makes sense that she like would like it's okay to go do that. I don't know. Yeah, she's not, she's legally not. Right. I will, I will sit down and talk to him on Monday but yeah go ahead and do that I thought we cleared that up last night. Right. Yeah, I just. Okay, we didn't clear it up. I just can't remember why I didn't. All right, well, I'm pretty office. Well there's also, are you going to be running people to sobriety first today. Yeah, I'm about to call them next to see if they're even open, because what the cold weather and everything I don't know if they're going to be open, but if they are then I'm taking two people over there. And how would you feel if I gave you a couple of added a few people to that list. Is that something that you'd be okay with or just try. I won't have the time capacity, maybe you can drop them off. And then come back and pick them up when they're done because taking two people over there, I'm basically sitting over there for two hours. Yeah, I do. But you can just drop them off and come back and get them. Yeah, that's what I've done before. All right. I'm calling there right now to see if they're even open. All right, thank you.

Hi, this is Brandon Coates. I'm calling to say it's not an emergency. Am I right? I cannot hear you. Do you have this on speaker? Yeah, one second. Sorry, is that better? Okay, that's a lot better. How can I help you? How about now? Yep, I can hear you. Go ahead. Okay, so this is a non-emergency line, correct? That's correct. For Foley, Minnesota, obviously. Correct. I called last night. I can't remember. I called 911. I'd have to look at my call records to know which time exactly. About a vehicle that had gone off the road on 23, just outside of, just going east or north of Foley. I don't know. And, yeah, I called and I told dispatch that I seen somebody out there. I didn't see him wipe out. But I was just notified that there was somebody that was found dead. It was a possible relative, like a friend of the family. I just need to kind of put two and two together. If that incident, that call that I made, was that followed up on? I mean, because actually when I drove into work this morning, that same vehicle was there and the light was still blinking. And then I heard, I'm hearing that this person that was just found died from exactly what I just described, and he was, like, frozen. Okay. So I can have an officer give you a call. What is your name and a number? My name is Brandon Gillis. A number you can reach me at is 320-775-9130. Okay. And how do you spell your last name, please? G-I-L-L-E-S. Okay. All right. I will have an officer give you a call. It might be a little bit, but I will have one reach out to you, okay? Okay. Thank you. All right. Thank you.",

    "transcript": "Hello, hey, so I'm, I can kind of, I can kind of talk now before I was like, in a very crowded waiting room, but yeah, so on my way home last night, I was driving through a very familiar area for myself in Foley and basically, long story short, like I seen a car, like I didn't see this car wipe out or anything, but I seen it in the, in the ditch, like, and clearly like, and it had like a left taillight blinking, and so I called, I actually, I literally called 911, like immediately, but I didn't stop, and just to let law enforcement know, like, I don't know if that person has already been helped or, or what, and a dispatch took my call that, and they're like, okay, we'll send somebody out, and, and I just passed a cop, like, like, within like the last 30 seconds of making that call, so I figured there would be somebody on it, right? Well, the client that I'm working with right now is, the first thing he says when he gets in the car, he says, dude, my nephew just got found dead in the woods, or, and when he clarified it, he said that, that, I don't know, the details that he described are strikingly similar to the incident that I drove past and called 911 about. He just said that, he said that the nephew basically went off the road and was stuck, and I must have been injured, and he, they found him this morning frozen, and I don't know, and yeah, like, in that same area, on that same highway, yeah, so I just like, kind of like, kind of shocked a little bit. I called dispatch back to be like, hey, you know, I'm the guy that made that call last night, like, did somebody go out and check that person out when I called, or, because I just, I told him, like, about what I just told you, I'm like, is this the same thing? And the lady says that she'd have a deputy call me back. But yeah. Okay, yeah, I mean, that's definitely pretty dramatic and pretty traumatic, right? Do you feel, like, a sense of, like, guilt because of that? Well, I mean, I guess my initial thought is not, like, myself, like, how do I react professionally in this? And even though I may already know the answer, I feel like it might be good for me to just hear it from somebody else, because, yeah, I don't know. I can deal with myself later, but I think I just wanted to, kind of, get your thoughts on how. Well, I mean, I'm somewhat confused in the sense of, like, I don't know what, so, I don't know, I guess, I naturally should just leave it alone right now and just be supportive, and, you know, there's no need for me to, kind of, delve into, like, was I there? Just kind of be supportive at this point. Yeah, I mean, I think that, you know, like, recognizing that, you know, I mean, I think that, you know, like, recognizing this and, you know, getting it, speaking your truth, right, getting it off your chest helps, but, like, you know, just like anything with our clients, we only want to share the tip of the iceberg, you know, based on, like, relevance as well as, like, gravity, you know, like, in some sense, we almost have to hold the space or hold the line in the sense of, like, being there in all of our capacity as a professional, you know, like, because we're there to support them. We're not looking for their support, you know, like, even though, even, like, and I know that sounds, like, very, kind of, dramatic and it's, kind of, like, bastardization of this situation, right, like, you're only trying to, like, help clarify as well as personalize, you know, like, given your direct experience or relation to this situation, you know, but I definitely think that, like, if you told me that, or let's just say, like, you know, I'm somebody else and that somebody told me that I, you know, oh, I saw them, you know, I called, but I didn't, you know, either wait to find out or I didn't, you know, double check and then now, like, I would almost, like, look at you, kind of, as one of the reasons why they died, even though it's clearly not your fault and or, you know, but it, like, almost leaves that door open for interpretation, for lack of a better term, you know, like, yeah, man, that's horrible, but, I mean, I want to commend you that you absolutely did the right thing, you know, like, as a human being, right, I mean, I would think as a man, as a father and as a professional, you know, those are all, like, very solid traits and or, like, you know what I mean, attributes, you're living up to your goals, you know, but, you know, maybe that's the, you know, I hate to say, but I don't know, man, like, life happens, you know, the cold happens, right, like, I mean, somebody could just be taking their time when you're drunk and fall down in the snow bank, you know, like, that happens a lot, like, you know, I'm really sorry that it happened to this client. Sounds like his nephew or cousin or something or, you know, like, you know, somebody young, that's hard for them to go, I mean, that, but again, that's, like, one of those freak accidents where someone literally tried to help them and then for whatever reason, you know, whether we know it or not, you know, it didn't work out. Yeah, I mean, yeah, that's one of the first things that the client said, he's like, you know, when, you know, when God wants to call you home, it's, you know, when it's your time, it's your time. Yeah, I mean, yeah, absolutely, you know, like, man, I think about, you know, death and mortality a lot, man, almost everybody that I know is dead, you know, and I could have easily been one of them and or, you know, different, for, you know, for whatever reason, I'm still here, you know, like, but at the same time, like, I have that, I have that, you know, somewhat survivor's guilt, so I can, I can empathize, you know, yeah, but yeah. Fucking wild, huh? Like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, as far as myself, like, now that I'm not in a fucking waiting room right now, I mean, it is like, uh, one of those scenarios where, like, I suppose, if I was, like, I don't know, really traumatic or something like that, I could be, like, oh, why didn't I stop? It's all my fault. But, like, obviously, like, I think, like, as a man and being in a situation and addressing those sort of hazards, roadside hazards, like, I, I think that I have used, like, my common sense, and yeah, absolutely. I mean, you, you did your part, bro, like, like, for sure, you called the people whose literal one and only job it is, and it's their, and, and they're the best at what they do, and they couldn't figure it out or do it, you know, for whatever reason, you know, it either slipped through their cracks through, you know, incompetence or negligence, you know, like, either one, hopefully not both, but, um, you know, if I were to call 911, I would assume that they would show up and do it, you know, I'm not going to be pulling somebody out of a burning building unless I'm already there with them, you know what I mean? Like, I'm also not going to be charging into somewhere without a gun, you know what I mean, expecting, you know what I mean? Like, so, you did what you could, man, you did what you could, you know? Um, I think that if anything, you know, the, the lesson here is that there's a silver lining in the fact that you're able to, like, you know, experience two sides of the coin in this, right? And whether or not you can extract or know what the lesson is in the moment, I think that it will come to you, you know? Like, you know, sometimes we're the, we're the bridge, we're the conduit, you know, we are the message sometimes. I don't know. Um, yeah. Yeah. Um, okay. Yeah, yeah. Well, thank you. Thank you for, um, yeah, taking my call and all that. Yeah, don't worry. Thank you for sharing that. I appreciate that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I kind of just needed to make sure, I don't know, because this, I'm not, this isn't, this isn't my time that I'm on when I'm here, but like, I, uh, needed to make sure that I kind of behaved accordingly and that this call has definitely helped. Yeah, no, definitely. I think, I think you, you, you definitely did. Um, if there's not anything else, can I let you go? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Perfect. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you very much. I'll talk to you later. All right. Peace out.",

Yeah, yeah, he was, he left the house last night and they told him not to leave and he was walking and the police, they were out searching for him and the police, Foley police was out searching for him and they found him frozen to death. So, so it wasn't, it didn't have anything to do with a, like a car going off the road? Um, from the sounds of it, from what Trevor was told, because he's friends with the sister and the husband or something, um, it sounds like he stopped walking. So, that's what Trevor told me, he was, he took off walking, he left the house and they found him frozen to death. But do you know what kind of vehicle he drives? Who? The, the, the victim, the, the person that died. No, I don't. Why? Um, well, the reason why is because, um, I, when I was, uh, passing through the Foley area last night, um, yeah, I, I seen it, like, I actually, I seen a, I didn't see this vehicle go off the road, like, but there's this vehicle that had clearly, like, gone, like, 20 feet into the, off to the side, and there was, like, one left taillight blinking, and, um, I wasn't sure if there was anybody that had already been helped over there, but I had just, like, passed the Benton County, uh, you know, administrative building, you know, the jail there, and there was, like, a cop sitting, like, right in the mouth of the parking lot, kind of, like, you know, watching for speeders or whatever, and, uh, so, and then I seen that, that, that vehicle, uh, you know, not even a mile away, and so I called 911 and let dispatch know, like, exactly what I just told you, you know, somebody out there didn't see it, uh, but somebody could go out there and check, and they're like, okay, we'll send somebody out, and then what tripped me out is when I was coming into work this morning, I drove past, and that vehicle was still there with, like, the same blue, blue, like, it's a blue car, left taillight blinking, and I don't know, I was kind of surprised that I saw that the thing was still there, uh, and then when, and then when, uh, Homeboy, you know, said that story, I was like, where, where did it happen, and he's, like, fully, and I was like, dude, that's exactly where I've seen this shit, so I don't know, I'm, I was, like, just trying to remain professional and be, like, you know, I'm sorry for your lot, but I kind of want to give more information, because if it's, like, connected, uh, I don't know. I think, uh, I'll call Trevor back, but I'm pretty sure he was walking. Was he walking because he went off the road? No, I, from what I gathered from what Trevor told me was, uh, he left the house, and they tried to tell him to stay there, or whatever, and he left the house, and then they went out searching for him, and, uh, they, uh, that's when they found him, or whatever. I think they might have found him, maybe at the Sloan Inn, I don't know, but, yeah, I didn't really get too many details, because I, once he told me that, I was like, oh my gosh, I think Brandon's with him right now. I need to call and let him know. Let's wait a second, actually. Right, no, okay, yeah, yeah, if you could find out of just a couple more, I mean, if he actually left on foot, or if he drove out of there, or just get a couple more details, I mean, maybe not, like, uh, yeah, thank you, thank you, but I'm on my way to Sobriety's Purse right now.

No. Do you have a physical or mental health condition including blindness that limits your ability to work or perform daily activities? No. Are you unable to work for reasons other than illness or disability? No. Are you going to treatment? No. I'm working on it, though. Okay. Do you have a job right now? No. Any self-employment? No. In the past six days, have you stopped work, quit work, refused job offer, went on strike, or asked for fewer hours? No. And when was the last time you worked? It's been a while. I'm a displaced union worker, so I'm waiting in between right now. I was supposed to get some job come up here, but I'm not sure when. I don't have nothing concrete yet. Okay. So you don't know when the last time you worked? It's been a few months, I guess. It's been a little while. I don't know if that's a little while for you guys. It's been seasonal a lot of times. Are you getting any unearned income like unemployment? No. Okay. Do you pay rent? No. I'm supposed to, but I'm not able to. Okay. Do you pay for your own cell phone? I don't have one right now. Okay. Are you court ordered to pay any child support? Yes. And do you know how much? And do you know how much? It's just all I owe is rears now, I think. But it's like, yeah, I'm like $30,000 behind. Okay. And do you have any cash in your pocket? No, I don't. Any bank account or debit cards? No. Any stocks, bonds, annuities or 401k? No. How about a vehicle? No. Well, I mean, I get rides. I don't have my driver's license anymore. Okay. In the past 12 months, have you sold, traded or given away anything of value? Not that I'm aware of, no. No. Okay. On your application, there's five questions. I'm going to ask them to you again. And it's yes or no after each one. Okay. As a court or any other civil or administrative process in Minnesota or any other state found you guilty, have you been disqualified from receiving public assistance? No. Have you been convicted of making fraudulent statements about your place of residence to get cash snap benefits from more than one state? No. Are you currently hiding or running from the law to avoid prosecution being taken into custody or to avoid going to jail for a felony? Nope. Have you been convicted of a drug felony in the past 10 years? Nope. And are you currently violating any conditions of parole, probation or supervised release? No, I'm not. All right. That is all the questions that I have. Do you have any questions for me? No, I don't know. I mean, I don't think so. I don't know. No. So if you are approved for food support, you're going to need to contact the EBT customer service line to get a replacement card. Okay. Okay. Do you want that number now? I think I know it's 877-997 or 9227 or something like that. Yep. Yeah. And now, so I have to, there's either two ways we can do this. I can transfer you to AI and they'll read your rights or responsibilities and reporting requirements. And then you have to verify with your name and date of birth after each of the three sections. Or I can read them to you really quickly. Do go ahead real quickly if you want. I'm in. All right. Do not get false information or hide information to get a continued benefit. Providing false information could result in disqualification for criminal or both. Yeah. Do not use cash or SNAP benefits to buy an eligible thing such as alcohol or tobacco. Do not let someone else use your EBT card or use someone else's EBT card. Faulty control may randomly choose cases to review. Failure to cooperate could cause benefits to end. And you must cooperate with program requirements. Your benefits may be denied or terminated. Okay. You have the right to privacy and we cannot obtain any information without your written consent or knowledge. We use the information that we do receive to determine your ongoing eligibility for cash or SNAP benefits. You have the right to reapply as often as you want, whenever you want. You have the right to know how long it takes to process your application. Benefits appear on cards after 10 a.m. this following day of approval. You have the right to know all the rules for the programs you're applying for. If you feel you've ever been denied or closed of any assistance, you have the right to appeal that decision. It is your responsibility to inform this agency of any changes by the 10th day of the following month or may be considered for overpayments or fraud. And lastly, discrimination is against the law. You have the right to file a discrimination complaint if you believe you're treated in a discriminatory way by a human services agency. Okay. So based on your answers, it does not appear that you are eligible for any cash assistance. Okay. Because you said that you are able to work. Yeah. It's just you're in between right now. Yeah. And you're not enrolled in treatment yet. Okay. So what I could do is I can review your application for food support. Mm-hmm. And at least get something for you for going for that. Yeah, that'd be great, actually. Okay. Do you have any questions? I'm sorry to take up your time. I try to go as quick as I can. No, no, you're fine. Thank you. I appreciate it. Nine minutes. No, that's perfect. Yeah, you're good. Okay. All right. I will process this and you will receive a determination letter within a few days. All right. Thank you. You're welcome. Have a good weekend.

Your parents can request your birth certificate for you If they have a valid ID So, I don't know if you have a relationship with your mother or your father but they can They they if they have a valid ID they can request a birth certificate for you That's going to be the easiest route Otherwise, they're special forms that you have to fill out Um have notarized all that sort of thing because him being Married to you. Do you have your marriage certificate? No, I do not Okay, we can get that though Well, you need an ID you both need an ID to get your marriage certificate So Do you have a relationship with either one of your parents, you know that they can Get you a I do not my mother.

She's like she's a nurse, you know I think we should we could call their the facility and I asked the staff if In her property they have checked and like her photo ID Like her photo ID But that's like the best chance that we could have No, there's no way it's worth asking.

Thanks for giving me a call. Yeah, I hear you. Yeah, not a problem. My dispatcher told me that you had called about this vehicle that was in the ditch last night. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did. Okay. Did you see anything with this vehicle last night or did you just kind of notice that it was there? No, I did not see any activity. I just noticed that it was there. That is all. It was there like when I saw it initially when I was on my way home and then on my way into work. It was basically the same thing. Same blinking light. It was still there. Yeah, yeah. We had numerous reports of this vehicle last night and into today. So the people who own the vehicle are trying to get it all squared away and get it removed from the ditch. It sounds like you had some other questions about the vehicle and I'm just going to kind of preface it by saying we do have an active investigation that's going on with it. So I can't release too much information. All right, I guess what I'm trying to connect like because I was made aware I had a client of mine. So yeah, there's a relative that passed away due to like being outside in the cold last night that was in this area and I just wanted to know if it was related to that vehicle or if it was not. Okay, well like I said I can't release too much information on it. I would encourage you to talk to family and they would probably have more answers if they were out there talking with us and helping us figure that out. So I would say what was the way to leave my the person that the family member was talking to the family member the person that is now deceased took off on foot and and if that's and if that's the case then that would mean that that car is not connected with that person. I just wanted to make sure that I didn't like call and then like a person didn't get help and pass or something. I don't even know. I'm really overthinking it a little bit. I just yeah I mean there's with this one there's a lot going on that I'm still trying to piece together with it. So if it was if it was your family member and this vehicle was maybe connected I would say reach out to your family members and they would probably have more information from you and then I can legally release to you. All right. Okay. All right. Okie dokie. Thank you. Stay safe. Stay warm. All right. You too, Brandon. I appreciate it. All right. All right.",

I wanted to thank you for working with Derek earlier. And I see Dagan is I'm assuming he's probably doing his, his assessment now. In just a little bit, he actually traded with another person. So, he is up next. He's what? Huh? He said you traded places with another person. So, he's what? He is next. Oh. He would have been done already, but he traded with somebody. So, he's next. Oh. Oh, what a nice guy. Yeah, I know. Okay. Well, I was actually going to, well, I'm not sure if he, by the time he's done, I'll probably actually be, I'm already on my way home. But he is driving himself. I was just going to ask if he could, you could instruct him to come to my office afterwards. Okay. Yeah, if it's super late, then you probably don't need to do that. I was going to say, it's probably going to be about 4, 430. Yeah, yeah. I think that's probably beyond. Yeah, so we're probably okay. I'll just catch up with him tomorrow. And I'm sorry to be that guy that repeats all my silly questions, but the ROIs were all signed. I don't need to do anything more. No, you should be good. They're signed. All right. All right. Cool.

Are you guys calling from, like, a facility's phone, or do you guys have a cell phone of your own? This is my cell phone. Okay. So if I can text you on this thing, and you can save my information. Yep. Contact. Yeah. Well, I don't know. So you're familiar with other CPRSs? Like, you're familiar with what we do, I guess? Do you? That's the question, I guess. Yeah. Almost. We have to be out March 1st. Yeah. Okay. March 1st. And we both qualify for subsidized or whatever. I see. Income-based. Yeah. You'll have to excuse me. I'm a little winded. I just got in the car and started driving like crazy. But, yeah, I'm going to text you something right now, and it's going to get you to, like, it'll save my contact info in your phone. Okay. It'll also, like, if you look in there, you'll see, like, another thing where you can register, and you can fill that form out. It's like a Google form. And that's basically step one. And then step two is, like, the second link in there. And if you could get through those two things, then we can kind of talk faster. Yeah, sorry. There's two of us? Can you text the same thing twice? You guys can both try to sign on or register, but, like, register separately. I mean, even though, like, you guys might, like, only be, you guys would be meeting with me together in case one of you, like, doesn't work, it's good to have the other person. I've seen it work out better that way when you both try. Okay. Do you have any questions for me besides this link I'm about to send? No, I don't think so. Do you? Do we have to get together with him? Well, first we have to get through the stuff he's going to text, register. Oh, okay. Yeah, we don't have any other questions. Okay. So I know you said March 1st is your deadline, so I'm going to make a note of that. And I'll send it in a text. I don't think I can do it while I'm on the phone. Okay. Yeah, but I'll make a note of that deadline and I'll probably call you probably tomorrow or on Monday at the latest. Let him know it's the mold in here we really need to get, because of our health. Yeah. We've got to get out of here. Let's see, yeah, Monday would be fine. I mean, if it's like an immediate thing, like, give me a call and I'll call you guys back in like an hour or two. Okay. I've got, like, a meeting and driving just ahead of me, but I can get back to you tonight if it's like an emergency, emergency. Thank you. Okay. All right. I'll text you and then I'll talk soon, okay? That's okay. Thank you very much. All right. You're welcome. Bye. Nice meeting you. All right. Bye.

One, we want to talk also about scheduling of appointments, you as the CPRS, some of the things that are your responsibility when you're working with clients, making sure that you're scheduling appointments ahead, before the meeting. And then wellness plans, some things I think Miles is going to share a little bit. That, I'm going to support him in doing so. And then staff evaluation, scheduling update, we see some things to touch on in those regards. Client engagement and professional accountability. And then just the update about our Pathfinder, making that switch. So, now, I'll start with the Pathfinder one, because I don't have a slide on there about that. So, when it comes to the switch that we're trying to do from Arsena to Pathfinder, we first love the idea, we love their software. Many of you guys were familiar with their software. This week, we received a message from Pathfinders that they are unable to transfer a lot of our data, because they just haven't had systems set up. And so, we've been using Percentive for almost two years. And so, we have a lot of client information. We have a lot of documentation, clinical documentation that we have on Percentive. And when we wanted to make the switch over, that was one of the things that we really, like, it was imperative, not only just for compliance, but for record keeping as well. And so, we were first initially told that that's something that would be possible. But recently, we've had a message, we got a message from them saying that they just don't have the systems to change that. So, this Pathfinder switch is no longer going to happen, and we'll be sticking to Percentive for the first year of the switch. And so, that kind of sucks, because we were really looking forward to that. That's the first update. Slide. All right, so, client safety with the ice presence here in Minnesota, specifically in the cities and other places. So, the first thing is that we're a peer recovery specialist. Your client safety, right? So, you have to be calm, observant, and you have to prioritize ensuring physical safety of your client during any perceived or concurrent ice presence. You know, we're not taking clients to go protest. We're not doing any of that, right? We're providing service for our clients struggling, so, in need of support, whatever type of support. You are a peer recovery specialist. You're not an immigration attorney, not a lawyer. Don't provide legal advice or interpretation of what your client's rights are, or in terms of, like, immigration law, right? Please stay in the role, which is very, very important when you're working as a peer recovery specialist. I know it's, you know, some people feel some type of way, people are worried, people are concerned. And it's been a really rough start to the new year, right? And so, I understand that, but at the end of the day, we all have a job. We have clients who we support, and so, we really don't want to lose focus. And that's not to say that all the stuff going on isn't important, but it's mostly to realign the focus that you have on the job. Protect client confidentiality. Don't share client information with anyone without proper authorization or a valid requirement. Communicate internally. Make sure that you're notifying supervisor safety concerns, unusual activity, or client distress-related enforcement. And so, just making sure that you're vigilant, you're responding, especially when you're working with clients outside of a facility. And then also, just be supportive. Some clients might, especially if you're working with clients who have immigrant backgrounds, different humans, never know what type of stress that they're going through, never know what type of duress that they're in, anxiety, fear that they have. And, you know, as it relates to them and their recovery, you want to make sure that you support them as much as you can. Any question on this? No. All right, so I made a post about this on Connect Teams a couple weeks ago, but this really has to do with client engagement and professional accountability, right? As a program director, one of my main focuses is really making sure that programs, peer recovery programs, working with clients struggling with addiction and their recovery, that it's working and also that it's moving forward, right? And a lot of that relies on not only the agency itself, but also the peer recovery specialists. And so one of the things that we've been seeing with the recovery specialists is that there is not a lot of engagement in certain areas. And then it's really due to some sort of circumstance that the CPRS, right? And a lot of times the thing that we'll do is that when CPRS has this issue, we look at the client caseload that they have, right? And so, you know, we see CPRS, they have, you know, X amount of clients, but they've only met with one or two and they have like 10 or 13 clients that are billable and there's just no shortage, right? And so one of the questions that I ask myself is, okay, what is this person going through? What's going on? And a lot of times there's a lot of barriers, and I understand some of those barriers can be very, very challenging. But, you know, at some point there needs to be some sort of resolve. And so when, but when this is a constant issue, and this is like, you know, every week there's an issue of some sort of difficulty, then at one point, do us, for us, like as the administration, you know, what do we do, right? And that's one of the things that we really talk about a lot. It's trying to make sure that the peer recovery specialist is as proactive as they can when they're reaching out to clients and engaging clients, not only when it's convenient, right? And so support, supervision, and problem-solving assistance are available, but initiated and followed through RSA, and that really only comes from us, right? We can only do so much to, you know, take these referrals that we're receiving, look at these clients who need services, try to pair them up with the most, the CPRS that fits the best, whether that has to do with their location or whether that has to do with gender preference or whatever this may be, cultural preference, things like that. But at the end of the day, it's really, really up to the peer recovery specialist to have some sort of follow-through. And when that isn't shown from the CPRS, you know, then it's a whole nother, right? And so, you know, this is community work, and a lot of times it's difficult in some circumstances, but it's not impossible. And so that consistency with the clients is something that we will encourage with homes. And so when capacity exists and engagement doesn't occur, this will be addressed as a performance issue. And so there is a weak performance or low performance, and that's something that will have to be addressed. Because a lot of times, it's an issue, you know, we do intake performance testing, you know, capacity is not sufficient. And so we have to start looking inward, try to figure out. Lacey, I don't know if you want to jump in on this. No, I think you covered it pretty well. Any questions? Okay, so a couple of things about admin time. Okay, so this has to do with submitting admin time requests. For any hours that are not billable, right? So, you know, when you're meeting with the client, you're providing service, that's work. But then there's also a lot of other work that you just can't bill for. That's considered work. And so we see a lot of times these admin requests, and then when people clock in, there is, you know, we'll go on the clock ends and there's that little box where you can type in some information. You know, that stuff is good, you know, it's to type that in. But also, there's an admin request form that we expect each CPRS, right? So here are a couple of examples, right? So there are some of you who work at partner facilities, you know, whether that's Catholic charities or whether that's missions, you know, hard house, wherever the case may be. And so, you know, when there is no billing of any client services that occurs, and you're there, and you're doing work, we need to fill out an admin. Right, with these meetings are included, any required trainings that you have, or any administrative or supportive tasks outside of the client service, right? So, you know, a lot of times that can include when you are helping clients fill out applications, or, you know, and the client's not present, or maybe you're doing some research and looking at some food shelves for a client, or wherever the case may be. Admin time is not automatic, and admin, an additional admin time form must be submitted. If admin time results in more than 40 total hours in a week, you have to fill out an overtime request, so that it can be completed. And then, the most important thing, because we've been seeing this a lot, those required forms must be submitted before the pay period ends. So, for example, pay period that we're in currently ends tomorrow. By tomorrow, you should have a good idea of all the work that you've done this past week. There is absolutely no reason for you to fill out anything next Tuesday, or next Wednesday, right? And so, you know, this creates a huge problem for Zenzen, for sure, but also when it comes to just, you know, what are these groups for, right? And so, we want to make sure that there's some organization and some accountability. So, just making sure that you're filling out these forms and submitting them before the pay period ends, so that by, you know, Monday when Z gets to the office, you know, there's not a lot of, you know, calling people and all this. It just creates a huge, huge issue. Z, do you want to touch on this? No, you pretty much covered it all. Any questions? No, sir. Okay. All right. So, we've been talking about scheduling appointments. And this is something that I've talked about plenty of times. And this is something that, you know, going into this year, we are really going to strongly enforce, right? When it comes to, you have to be able to schedule appointments with your clients ahead of time. This creates structure and creates healthy boundaries within the clients. I've said this before, and I'll say it again, right? If you are meeting with clients, right, and this appointment just came out of thin air, you know, that is very problematic. Don't do that at the doctor's. Don't do that with your therapist. Don't do that with any other health professional, right? And so, when we see this with peer recovery specialists, you know, it kind of can be disappointing, right? And some of the issues that comes from this is, number one, a lot of times, you know, especially with the boundary, because it's so important, is because, you know, you want to be able to have structure in your relationship with the client, right? An example would be, you know, you call your client and you're just like, hey, are you free? Can you go figure this out? And maybe the service that you're doing in that appointment is something that is worthy and it's something beneficial, but how it was set up wasn't in the most healthiest way. What happens is, you know, you send a message to your client that, you know, you're available when you call, right? Or sometimes the client themselves will call you and need you whenever that they want. And what happens is, a lot of times, this can lead to the client having some sort of resentment when you're not able to. Does this make sense? And so, it's really important to set a boundary with your client. That's your gut as a peer recovery. When you meet with the client and this is your first initial meeting, this is responsible as a peer recovery, right? There needs to be some sort of commitment, number one. And then number two, as far as your availability, right, with this client, that has to be something that is there and present. So, saying something like, okay, well, you know, let's say you're meeting with John Doe and that's your client and you build some rapport and understanding of what you're there for and what you're there to provide. Saying something like, okay, how many days in the week do you think, right? Whether it's one day a week, whether it's twice a week, however much support you're needed, can you give me some times that would work for you and would work for me that we can meet up, right? And then work on these things in the recovery space, right? That's what peer recovery should look like. It shouldn't ever be, you know, you wake up, you get out of your bed, you brush your teeth, and then you just start your day and you just start calling clients, hey, where are you at? What are you doing? You know, that's not peer recovery, right? Like the scheduled appointments is something that we're really going to stress, right? It's to not only to protect the client, but it's also to help encourage, you know, professional development in our CPRs. Like I said before, you can't find another health professional in any field where the client just shows up or the patient just shows up. You know, peer recovery is not a walk-in service, right? The scheduled appointments is what we are going to. So making sure you're scheduling those appointments. And now here's the other thing that I'll say to you. You know, are there times where there are emergency situations and things pop up? Of course. But that's not every appointment. It's not every appointment. Scheduling them in advance, creating those healthy boundaries, it's going to increase productivity, and it's going to be a benefit to the client's day. So go on Connect Teams. You really want to make sure you schedule for the upcoming. If you're meeting with clients today, if you're meeting with clients tomorrow, or this week, talk to them. We need to have scheduled appointments. What days and times? And this is another way to hold the client accountable. Because I remember when I was a CPRS, there were times where, you know, I'd be sitting in front of a building, waiting for a client to come out, and they don't show up sometimes, right? And so, you know, these things happen. But again, it's up to you to establish that balance. As the coach. Right? So scheduling ahead of time. You want to do them on Saturdays. Right? That's the last day of the pay period. And the last day of the week. So for the following week, for the following week, Sunday, all the way up to the next Saturday, you want to be able to schedule your appointments. Now, whether you're full-time or part-time, you want to do it according to your availability and how many hours you need to meet. So you have to communicate with the clients. You have to call them up and schedule. Any questions? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I have a question. So when we're doing appointments and we're setting up the appointments, is that billable admin time? Yes. Yes. Yes. But also, I don't think that's something that's going to take a long period. Depends how many clients you've got. Yep. Any other questions? No. Okay. Miles, you want to take it from there? Yeah. So the wellness plans are important. They are supposed to be a guide work or a frame for what you do but also how you do it. And these are mandatory not just by the company but by the state of Minnesota. So they are due for every single client by the third appointment regardless of whether or not this is your assigned client or not. As a recovery specialist it is on you to be a professional and to be aware of who you're working with and also what the purpose of this visit is and keep that in mind when you are meeting with somebody that you are not just an Uber but that you are trying to help somebody achieve their goal and that this goal has to tie in to what you are doing and vice versa. If you're not sure of what any given client's status is what the last day of their wellness plan or what the wellness plan says you are supposed to either look yourself or reach out to your supervisor for help and they will walk you through that. As far as the actual wellness plan goals you should ask yourself what how and why are you going to accomplish each of these goals. And it should be stated using the SMART or S-M-A-R-T rule of thumb that means specific measurable attainable relevant and time oriented. That means that you should be able to take any given goal and break it down into manageable steps that are going to be documented and then it's also the expectation to document this progress so that then we can keep track how, when, and where we're helping clients achieve their goals and then be able to refocus their recovery on the next wellness plan to be able to improve and update things. If you are unsure of whether or not something qualifies as peer recovery again it is your it is the expectation that as a professional you reach out for clarification on that to another peer or again to your supervisor. As of right now we'll be going through every single peer on every single person's caseload to look at when and what their recovery wellness plan says and so you'll be hearing from either Lacey or I in the next week or so any changes or needs that need to be met. Moving forward I'm going to be offering training both online and in person on an as needed as well as a monthly basis for people that have any questions or need you know some additional work. Lacey if you want to chime in I think I'm done. Thank you. So I actually spent the majority of my day going through wellness plans today and I was blown away by the amount of craziness and lack of care on these wellness plans. The majority of your wellness plans I'm not saying everyone but you know who you are. There are multiple goals that are the same exact goal for every area of wellness on certain individuals like certain goals on their plan. So if I pull up a client's caseload or a client's profile and I pull up their wellness plan it will say social wellness I need support learning how to stay sober and then it's that for every single goal. I'm not sure how that really lines up with state legislation honestly. If there's copy and pasted goals blank wellness plans, wellness plans with six months out to a year expiration or just empty forms. I'm just curious if this is a reflection of how much you care about Generation Hope and your position. That's all I got. Yeah and I'll just add to that you know wellness plans your appointments with the clients every time you're meeting with a client always is directly tailored to that recovery. And so when this is something you're you cannot tolerate. When you are you know if you're a recovery wellness plan just stay in line. That's egregious right? Everybody wants this but at the end of the day what is the plan? That's just an outcome that you're desiring. What is the plan? Meaning what is the method? What are you going to do? What are you going to try? And so this is something that we're going to clearly focus on. One thing you know we spend time looking at is these recovery ones. So Miles also is going to be offering to meet with some of you to basically go over. So we definitely like to see changes in the next couple of weeks. And then also like another thing is you know sometimes things happen where a staff member or CPRS isn't able to meet a client and another CPRS meets with that client right? You know your first thing if I'm the CPRS and for example Miles wasn't able to meet with this client and Miles said hey this client needs some support. Could you meet with them? My first thing is I should look at this client's recovery wellness plan. And when I look at that recovery wellness plan I should try to assist in that. And so the problem, the issue that we have is that when even if a CPRS does that, the original CPRS who's working with this client the wellness plan isn't even sufficient to give me any guidance as to how to help this client. And so you know the question has been are we really just failing our clients that we're you know that we promised to help and support? So you know again smart goals is something that we should all know as CPRS. I honestly forgot to add that to this to this slideshow presentation. But you know making sure that the goals are specific and measurable, attainable, they're relevant and that they're timeless. And so the time basis is also the most important. And this is because goals change. We all are in recovery. We know what it's like to one day have a goal to do this and then you know and like one of the things is you complete a goal and then that's it. You know you're often left feeling bored or not motivated and feel stagnant sometimes. And so it's important to really look back into a client's recovery wellness plan and if a goal is completed you need to release that off. If you had a goal on there where you know they wanted to get their driver license restored. Right? And that is completed. If you did that then your job is to go back in there and have another meeting with the client. Even if it's to just go over the recovery wellness plan or to update it. That's a billable service. And so again you know I think this was said already but things definitely need to change regarding the recovery. Any questions so far? Any questions? Yes. Okay so I ran into a situation and it was a client that I picked. Sorry I had an echo on my phone but it's really bothering me. Let me mute. Are we good? Okay so I had a client that I basically started working with from another peer and I went into his appointments and I noticed that his next appointment that he had to have was for a wellness plan and so that was our main goal for meeting the day that I decided to meet him and when he showed up he was drunk. Like really really drunk and there was issues going on with his child down in the cities and I'm not going to get into everything but that was the reason for him drinking and so I still encouraged him to try to do a wellness plan but he wasn't really able to focus too well on it. Now I can go back into that same wellness plan and update and add more goals at a later date can I not? Or do I have to make a whole new one? So one of the things that I would encourage is doing the wellness plans with the client present and a lot of times that's to make sure that these goals are coming from the client and then okay so he was there yeah okay yeah I mean yeah it's hard to do a recovery wellness plan if he's intoxicated but yeah if you know those goals then you can go in there because the document for the recovery wellness plan isn't a billable document right and so yeah you can go back in there and edit for sure. Okay. Sorry I thought you meant like initially doing it but I remember you said this was already done right or is somebody else's client? He was somebody else's client and I just started working with him and that day that I met with him we were supposed to do a wellness plan and then he showed up intoxicated. Yep. Okay yeah that's fine. Yeah our main thing is just the wellness plans just being like four words five words not specific just very general statements that is and if that's something that is continuing to be seen there will definitely be write-ups and so we encourage everyone meeting with your clients today if you got some time tomorrow go through your caseload go back to your recovery wellness plans if you're especially especially if you are you know if you're doing 20 hours a week 15 hours 25 hours with these clients and then you go to the recovery wellness plan and you know it's just like a bunch of money will jump and that's a problem. Sorry. Any other questions? Thank you Heidi. All right. Let's go to the next slide. Lacey do you want to come here? Yes. The three month evaluations Azak can you mute? The three month evaluations are due this month but due to the holidays that's why we hadn't completed them yet. So I will be sending out a link to sign up for the schedule to complete your three month evaluations. I would highly suggest to anyone who has knowingly submitted any individual wellness plans that do not meet requirements to update these prior to your evaluation. Yeah. So I will send out that link after this meeting today. All right. Was that it? Yep. Any questions? I would just like a second longer with this. I'm going to also put this presentation in the chat. All right. So that's all we have for today. I want to say thank you to everyone for the work that you guys do every single day. We really are just trying to make something that originally to last however long you know since 2020, 2021 something that was always very just go as you wish and we're trying to really organize it as much. So it's something that's imperative that we have and so we really need everyone to really step up their game, especially with the recovery. Mr. Markey, do you have a question? I had a question regarding the DAP notes. So you know how I feel like I don't know. I'll speak for myself. I kind of keep it very somewhat broad not too personal or too deep into what's going on within the client but speaking of encouragement and of like such things in that manner or like you know what the client could be going through would we like I know last time we talked about this in the staff meeting to detailize and speak a little more like it has to be more than three sentences like you know that should be the bare minimum. But I was thinking should we deep dive into what's really going on with the client aside from like not just good or bad but just like in general should we just talk more? Yes, 100%. 1,000%. You have to. General statements a lot of times are left for interpretation. Like whatever note that you guys do in the back of your head should always be there. At the end of the day if there's an audit or when there's an audit that the person who is leading that can visualize what you did in that. It's very hard to do when you have a lot of general statements and so the data, the assessment, the planning all of that is important. The other thing is if you have a meeting for you know two hours or three hours you know I'm sorry the note has to be extensive. It cannot be, I don't even think a paragraph is sometimes sufficient, right? Otherwise I mean what were you doing, right? Again, somebody reading this note has to be able to read this note and see every single thing I've done according to the time of the service line that was filled. Alright? So you really want to make sure that your notes are extensive. And then go ahead. My bad, sorry. So I know we already went by it. I should have asked the question earlier but you were just on a flow so I just wanted to listen but with the transportation challenges I wanted to speak on that majority of these guys do not drive that I work with and on top of that it's the most accommodating thing that I do so I really all these sessions and these meetings that we have is really based on me just driving. It would be like to a destination. You know what I mean? When you guys were talking about Uber it's not really the case. You know what I mean? So I was trying to see like if you can get what I'm saying. If it makes sense. Lacey, you want to touch on that? Is the question I guess I don't understand the question. Are you trying to say that most of your appointments are aimed towards strictly transportation? Yeah, it would be going to like a part of the recovery wellness plan would be like health, fitness, grocery shopping, grabbing medications, taking them to go dose. It's like a lot of those things could be used for their med cabs but majority of the med cabs they're limited. So it's like I don't want my DAP note to end up looking like oh this guy took him here, took him there, took him this. You know what I mean? Do you put details in your note about the things that you discussed during your meeting that are recovery related as well? Most definitely, yeah. Then you're good. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Then one thing I'll add to that and then I think Heidi has a question. That shouldn't be the totality of your meetings and peace of mind. Right. Because then it is just, you're just their driver, right? And yeah, they could utilize medical cab for that. They could take a bus, whatever. But you are CPRS and you have a lot more to offer in the service that you provide aside from just this. And so if these things that are in their recovery wellness plan, things that you want to work on that you're giving them a ride for, that's okay. But also, it shouldn't be all the meetings that you have with these clients. Right. And then... Oh, sorry. Yep. Does that make sense? Yeah, most definitely. Most definitely. Thank you. Yep. Go ahead. Since you said that. I was going to ask, so like if there's places that a client can't meet, like if they're in a treatment center or they don't want you to come into their house, where are some places that you can meet like other than the library or... I often find myself taking my clients to the gym because you know, a lot of them don't have the funds to go meet at a coffee shop or meet, you know. So I'm wondering, where are some other places that we can meet that would be a constructive space? Because I felt too, where it's like a lot of the times we are driving, you know, or we'll go to the gym for wellness or we'll go, you know, work on housing at the library. And sometimes I feel like also I don't want to... Sorry, I got my baby with me. I don't want to force the client to talk too much, especially if it's in the beginning of meeting them. So I kind of want to like make sure they feel comfortable and a lot of the times, I feel like not all the time, I'm not saying we don't talk, but sometimes they're talking on, like they have phone calls coming in or like specifically on the car ride. You know, and then when we're there at the library, we'll do like vital documents or whatever. So I guess my question is A, what is a constructive environment that we can meet in that don't cost money? And B, like what is the boundary line of pushing clients to talk about things and like letting them get to know you? It's a really good question. I have an answer, but I want to open the floor for other CPRs who could probably help or have had this sort of struggle when they were first starting off. I suppose I could say something. I don't know if this is really the 100% best answer, but I mean looking for places that don't cost money that can provide like a peaceful setting in the summertime, it'd be like at a park. Minneapolis has a lot of great parks that are just super chill, peaceful, no distractions. That's all I got. Thank you. I would say, Azak, you got to mute. I would say places like anywhere that's free, basically, like you could even go around the mall, walk around the mall, be a mall walker, or gym, yep, that's a good idea. Brandon had a good idea for the parks. If there's any type of if you go to meetings, show up at a meeting early. They always have rooms with chairs and tables that you could sit at and chat before a meeting or stay after a meeting. One thing that I want to circle back to why I had my hand raised when it comes to DAP notes, what I found useful and helpful in my, when I was first started, I did not use this and I was always like, oh my gosh, 250 characters, how am I going to get that? But what I started doing and what really helps and it kind of helps flow is I got into basically story form. From the time that the client gets into my car or comes to my office, it's just painted out into a story form from the beginning of the meeting all the way into the end and that's what I type. And I found that that is becomes really detailed sometimes it's extremely long and but it gets out everything like from point A to point B to what we talked about, how they respond, what I've observed like the client's feelings and emotions and that kind of stuff. But that's all. Very good. Okay, fine, let's go. Yeah, also, you know, sometimes college campuses, I know when I was doing peer recovery and work, a lot of times I would go to MCTC, they have a pretty good space in Normandale for some of my clients who live in that area. A lot of those community colleges have really nice spaces where you can just sit down and talk. I think libraries probably my favorite, honestly, when it comes to meeting with clients just because it's, you know, there's some libraries here in the cities that have some really big spaces and quiet spaces that you could really sit down and have that connection with the client. As far as your question earlier about like, you know, when it comes to getting clients to speak, it can be difficult, right, when you're building rapport with a client you just met. I would say number one, that is also an opportunity to talk about your recovery story and, you know, just mentor through self-disclosure of your personal recovery experiences, that way they just get to listen, but also ask them open-ended questions, right? It shouldn't sound like an interrogation where all their answers are either yes or no, right? So that's another helpful tip. Just take your time with it and also, you know, rolling with resistance. Sometimes you get clients who are resistant to any type of I guess talking sometimes a lot. People sometimes could be very, very quiet. They really don't want to say much, but, you know, just acknowledging them, giving affirmation, understanding that, hey, they might be uncomfortable, this is the first time we're meeting, I get it. One of the most effective things is always restating what you are there for. I'm here to help, I'm here to support, I'm here to provide you comfort and your recovery and things that you need me to do. What do you need help with? Or what are some things that I could help you with in this recovery wellness plan? Or what are some goals that you have that you want to accomplish? Or what's the one thing that you're struggling with? Just trying to understand exactly where they are at in their life, in their recovery. That's how you get people to start forward. Especially when, you know, especially when early recovery, for some people who are just, you know, they might still be using, or they might have had a relapse recently, or they're in a predicament. Those things can very, very help. So, hopefully, I hope that helps. Any other questions? All right. Well, I hope everybody has a great weekend. Stay indoors, it's pretty cold. And we'll see each other in February. Thank you, Azak. Thank you, Azak. Have a good night. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Stay warm, everyone. Thank you, guys. Drive safe.",

    "transcript": "Hello? Hello. Hey, what do you think about that message that I just sent you? Um, I'll look at it. Let me look at it. I don't know where it is. So, wait. Okay, so, alright. Uh. Wait, my thoughts process was at negative degrees. Hold on, I gotta run this pizza out, okay? Okay. I'll be right back. Okay. Okay. Okay. Hello? Hello. Hello. Yeah, I'm here. Okay, what do you think? Um, I mean, I like it, but the one thing I really get hung up on is the part where you said the mental health assessment. Because, like, the thing is, they give, they require people to, like, get mental health assessments, like, all the time. And, like, let me just be saying that. Oh, really? That's so good. Like, where did you get it done? So, like, you know, the one right down the road. Hold on, wait, what'd you say now? Like, they give mental health assessments all the time. And, like, they're, that's, like, they're fuckin' bread and butter. I mean, if you mention, like, mental health assessment, then they're gonna get an erection and, like, ask more questions about it. Okay, what should I call it? Well, naturally, it's called a chemical health assessment, a STD assessment. But then, like, you don't want to, like, start off by saying that. Because, I mean, so then I was thinking while you were running your pitch, and I was like, it'd be good, it'd be, like, almost good to say, like, so I had a friend in recovery that told me about these CPRSs. And I thought about getting one. So I went and had the CD assessment done so I could get one. So I'll call it a CD assessment? Yeah. But, like, you know, but I would say that the reason why you had to get the CD assessment wasn't because of your personal, like, addictions or concerns. It's from, like, because... A referral from a friend? Yeah, like, it's somebody that you know that does, is in recovery, like, recommended that you get one of these CPRSs. And it's actually, here, I'll actually verify it. CPRS. Oh, did you just change it really fast? Huh? Oh, no. Nothing. Oh, okay. Yeah, the CD assessment. And, honestly, that CD assessment, it is good that you share that with them because, like, that CD assessment says what you want it to. And, like, if it says, like, oh, nice, she's good. Like, all she needs is a fucking CPRS and she's good. Like, they honor that shit like gold. So call it a CD assessment because they give you what you want, pretty much? No, well, I mean, so a CD assessment, when you go in and get it voluntarily, like, they put what you want on it because, you know, they see that as, like, a sign of respect. Like, okay, this person's coming to us. So they're going to be more lenient about what you want put on there. But if you're court-ordered to get a CD assessment, then, like, they make you go to, like, certain places sometimes or whatever. And, like, a lot of times you can go in there and you can tell them, like, what you want, what you think they want to hear. Yeah, that's pretty much what I did is I did pretty much tell that lady what I wanted. She recommended something else. She recommended something like some arms or something like that. And I was like, well, I heard from a friend about this peer recovery thing. And she was like, okay. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. But, yeah, so, I mean, in certain circumstances, like, those CD assessments can, like, send people to treatment against their will. And, like, that's why people do kind of, like, not, like, get it done. But when you get it done voluntarily, it's totally different. So if you show them that CD assessment, that will, like, do substantial to clear your name. Okay. Because it's, like, a legal document. It's basically a professional licensed alcohol drug counselor just said that he's good. So, like, you can take that to the court. And that's what they literally do do with that. So you're, like, Hold on. I'm going to edit this up right now. Hold on. Okay. Okay. So a friend of mine was telling me about. What is it? What's your program? She goes through. I would word it like a friend of mine is in recovery. She told me about. I don't want to say anything about a friend, like, friends in recovery and shit. I mean, like, it's definitely a good thing. Would you have friends in recovery? Because it says, like, no, no, because look, this is the first thing. It caught his mom made this report about it. The people that I hang out with and shit like that. I don't really want them to think that I hang out with people like that. No, I want them to think I'm completely normal. So, like, should I say a friend of mine who's. Struggles with recovery. Recovery is a good thing. Being in recovery is like, I know it is. But, like, they even made this, like, part of my, like, case plan. Like, that I'm having safe, sober people around my son and, like, shit like that. What you say? They even made that part of my fucking part of my case plan with them. My case plan is that I have I bring my son. Make sure he gets to all of his doctor's appointments in school, but he's not old enough. And then to make sure I remain in safe housing and make sure that I keep safe, sober people around him. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I thought you said something different. I was like, what? Stuff like that. Like, I just don't even want to bring up that I have people around there like that, you know? Well, people are in recovery. That's different than just drug addicts like that, because I'm in recovery. And I'm like a good upstanding gentleman of the community. You gave me this laugh there. I thought. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I'm not a drug addict. I'm an upstanding. I know. I know. I know. I'm making a joke out of it right now, but it's totally socially acceptable. It'd be like, it's totally different if you're like saying my friend who does drugs. Like, that's not. But like, in recovery, that means that they're, they're, they're bonafide. Okay, so say a friend of mine in recovery was telling me. Yeah, mention the CPRS. What did you call yourself again? A CPRS? A peer support. Peer support. Okay. Okay. CPRS. Yeah, yeah. You could just say peer support, peer support specialist or something like that. That's what a lot of people call them. I think because I'm a nerd, I call it like that, but. God, this fucking juice is so good. Is it? No. No, you can't have any of my juice. Oh, fuck you, dude. It is good. You can't have any. What is it called? Like, what is it called? I'm trying to think of what it would be called for somebody who gives you, like, the things that you can sign up for, like, agency shit like that. What would that be called again? A referral? Why the fuck can't I think of the name, dude? Tell, like, they tell you when, when somebody tells you about, like, different programs that can help you. What are they called? What are they called again? Why can't I think of it? Uh, you're just thinking like a, like a referral, I don't know, an assessment recommendation. Um, hold on. Okay. Resources. Resource advocacy. Okay. Let me call you right back. All right.",

I wish you would have told me that I'm in my house slippers. Green dumpster? Is it, is it right by the church? No, no, no. It's by the apartment building. It's an apartment building, right? No, it's a house. It's a big-ass house, but he's like staying in like one of the back rooms there and you see a truck. Okay, well, hold on, I'm... Wait, you said it's 5 what? 518. 518. Yeah. 518.

guys coming here no i don't think so i don't think anybody why i don't know fucking everybody over there's got some fucking stick up their ass apparently except for cory cory's too cool i do not have a stick up my ass yeah you clearly do whatever i fucking tried calling you last night your fucking phone's not even on sure sure what i don't know yeah my maximum effort i don't know i guess i just don't really have a very good mood about it um i don't know not just that there's other things and um i don't know when i do come out there i don't think anybody's gonna like what i have to say what do you mean well i'm pretty fucking confident that like there could be some immediate change like either all the girls come back here or one or two of them or something but i don't know your your content uh as of late has been like not there anymore so i mean you said just yourself the other day that you're fucking your stress level is fucking super high and you're not feeling good and all that shit and i understand and i i've already think you do a good enough job i just want to find a balance that is going to work for everybody because so because you aren't happy with my level of course you're just gonna decide like make some executive decision that the kids aren't living here anymore um like i don't think that's fair or at all well what i don't think is fair is me like sending the girls over there to you and it's supposed to be like we're looking for like a better solution for things and then like they've gotten like 60 fucking like charties like absences ashton hasn't completed a single assignment the entire year and i asked her if you've helped her at all and she she didn't answer me so i'm assuming that's a no when i ask the kids if they have homework and they tell me no when i bring them to school every day like i can't what am i supposed to go to school with them and fall this is the thing is like you can't do everything on your own you can't do everything on your own and i understand that you're doing a great job and you're doing the best you can but like you're not using me at all to like to like three hours away you think that fucking mattered at all when like you were the other way around you i made like a sincere active like effort to always like bring you into the picture have you part of conversations decisions like all these things and you just stopped giving a fuck that's not even true no you did and it's whatever you got shit going on apparently you're like you got but that's okay you honestly you have like been working your ass off and there's no doubt about that but i'm not saying like you're a piece of shit i'm just saying there needs to be a change because i'm seeing like the like from an administrative point of view this is not working brandon you do realize when the kids are with you you pick them up from school like every other day like you're acting like this is like some new thing the kids are not doing bad the kids are happy here like all right well we're gonna i don't know you're gonna something's gonna change something's gonna change so i'm sorry but you don't just get to you don't just get to make like some fucking executive decision on this like the kids are old enough to decide where they want to live and like i'm not just not like you need to put your fucking grown-up pants on because yes you are don't fucking talk to me like that well you you realize what you just said i'm not going to make some executive decision no i would be making like a co-parent decision but you this is the first time you fucking called me and that's not true the entire time you've had them really this is the first time i've called you since i've had the kids yeah when was the last time you called and you were like hey what's going on like uh there's this going on we got this going on you've never fucking once called me for anything not not for a fucking dance not for choir not for conferences that is incorrect the first time they've had conferences since since they moved here was the week that they fucking started school was i supposed to go to conferences when they just started there the semester just ended on the 22nd that means they had to have had some sort of fucking conferences at some point well they did right after fucking school started when they started school here the reason i was so like easily to be like yeah you guys can go over to your mom's is because that's like the kind of mutual respect i feel like we have and i feel like if i were to have like said no i since you guys are actually technically in my custody and not hers like that's not gonna happen if i were to said some shit like that that would have totally broken and i feel like you're violating my fucking trust by the actions that you've been doing lately brandon you act like i've been on some fucking vendetta against you last couple times i've talked to you i'm like dude what's wrong like are we cool like and you're like yeah no it was just one thing i mean at first it was one thing but uh i don't know dude you don't really have because the last couple times that we have had encounters you've been fucking rude and you've been like encounters you've been fucking rude and mean and you say these hurtful ass things and expect me just to be like you're right everything's cool sounds good like it's not gonna fucking happen i'm not just like okay so because of that that's the reason why you like basically cut me out of the fucking whole parent i haven't cut you out of anything brandon this whole one seems a little older but i think yeah and like the girl's fucking you know pissed off at me like this whole time and you've done what to fucking fix that for me nothing i talked that's fuck you brandon that's not even fair i fucking tell them like they need to fucking talk to you i tell them how important it is for them to fucking not hold grudges and that you're their father and that you love them and everything that you do is like you're trying your best and you're trying to be there for them like you can fucking ask them that but you yourself you just admitted to having a vendetta against me and not what i did not just say i have a vendetta against you don't fucking put words in my mouth well because you said that i've been an ass the last couple of times i've seen you that that's why you don't want to talk to me no that's not i'm telling you that yeah you do fucking say fucked up shit to me and i'm not okay with it i'm not cutting you out because of that i want you to know like honestly you're like one of my fucking closest and my fucking dearest my longest fucking friends i've ever had and i love you and i fucking i just think it's really unfair of you to like sit here and make these assumptions and say that i i don't fucking care i haven't done anything like i have and i talked to the kids about the shit that's been going on with you and i tell them you will you need to talk to your dad nothing's gonna fucking happen am i what am i supposed to like force them drive them up there fucking leave them with you in a fucking locked room so you can talk to them like you're the fucking one not coming fucking down here yeah i'm the last fucking three or four times i've been down there i drive we drive like six hours and like the girls so we drive down there last time and mind you it's like a six hour fucking drive round trip for all of us and like the girls get an attitude because you and fucking corey are drinking and they blame it all on me for drinking and i wasn't even i didn't even have a fucking single drink that night and then like so like i took the fucking complete heat for that shit and then like and i'm not fucking drinking anymore because of that because they don't like it that's fine like that's not what they were all thought like what the only issue was yeah no that's not the only issue i'm sorry buddy quite honestly like i feel like you're being slightly like irrational about this stuff well i'm not but i'm having a conversation what i'm just having a conversation with you i'm not freaking out i'm not yelling i'm talking about over the overall picture of everything brandon you're actually like this is like some fucking huge thing that's happened like it's not it's really not it's not that fucking serious that's what i'm saying too but yet the fucking girls are just i don't know i'm just i'm fine everything's going to be fine but i don't fucking feel like driving six hours for everybody to fucking give me a bunch of attitude and and us to have this conversation like yeah we need to have this conversation and i can't imagine it going it's fucking super splendid don't even think about it so and you know honest honest it's different though i think that after like everything like and after all these years like i feel like you fucking know better that like i am on your side when as far as it comes to the kids like i don't talk shit about you to the kids no matter how i feel about you and i don't always feel the best towards you because you're kind of a fucking dick sometimes but i always have your back so for you to like still make these assumptions that like i just what i'm over here fucking like throwing you under the bus or something that's not fair and i really it does hurt my feelings well you must not value my opinion that much i mean otherwise you probably would have fucking called me about i don't know something but i fucking did call you uh and i fucking have been not feeling great and that's not because of the kids here this would be fucking regarded like with without the kids if i could have struggled with this shit my whole fucking life and it doesn't mean that i just can't handle having them here i'm not saying that you can't handle the kids that you you know produced i'm not saying that i don't want them to leave we're gonna have to figure something out whether it's you fucking like but ultimately like you are you have a bunch to fucking chew on right now and you're doing a great job you don't necessarily fucking need to fill that space with like other things i'm here for you to like help you um yeah like we need to fucking co-parent like all right you look at like the way huh what do you want what is like just to make this better like what is it that you want me to do you want me to call you fucking every night want to have a chit chat every night no dude i want the girls fucking mental health fucking like up kept i want fucking the girls to get good grades i want them to not be fucking doing drugs and if they are doing drugs they better be getting good grades okay well they haven't been doing drugs well i don't know that the kids were also not getting good or like great grades when you were like i just feel like you kind of have a double standard here like you act like they you were just like little fucking angels up there and they've come down here and i'm just suddenly whatever like that's not true this conversation doesn't have to be like this i'm not fucking being all dramatic like that and i think you're taking everything doesn't have to be like that just calm down can i say something oh my god both of you yeah so anyways like i was having a conversation with the girls the other night you know and this is i know that's not a lot to talk about you guys might not know this um but they're you know like with the tardy thing um i think it could be fixed but it's like i know where they go and they go to the bathroom and they just go straight to the bathroom and they said the teachers don't go there and check and i i don't know maybe you guys want to talk talk to the school about that i don't know i don't know if that's gonna help you guys they do they just hang out in the bathroom i missed that's what they just told me that like the other day too and it's like i don't know what to do at that point because like i fucking get my ass up every morning make sure the fucking kids are at school on time like they're never i'm they're never late because we're late to school i've never once brought them late to school and it's like i can't like they need to be doing what they're supposed to be doing but like i can't follow them around class every day and i could maybe they would stop skipping class i don't know well yeah that's that's where they go so i don't know i mean the only way you're with the school you know i mean i think it's kind of weird that teachers don't go in there yeah all right yeah we can definitely talk to them about it and all that like i understand that it's an issue and they should you know i mean like yeah i don't know i know i know ava's passing all her classes but uh hello is not yeah well and i talked to ella about it like that too that was she both of the kids i was like if i if i didn't think that you guys were capable of getting better grades i wouldn't be like on you about it but the fact is is that you guys are both capable of doing either either have like all really good except one class yeah but the other two and i oh so she's helping science and i was like okay so when i come home and i ask you guys do you have homework or anything and you tell me no that's the time to say maybe mom i don't have homework but like i'm not understanding this like can you help me with it and like i will yeah she said that like she would start doing that and like letting me help her and so i mean like it's not like i'm just ignoring these things or if they had like after school tutoring classes i got a printout when i talked because i like talked to all their teachers on this on the app or whatever i was like because i like i don't know this is like a month ago and i got a printout of all the assignments from all the teachers so like i can give that shit to you so that you know like what's actually been handed out what's like what they i mean because i know taken and i don't i don't necessarily blame them because like when they get home they're like and you're asking like really do you got homework they might genuinely just not remember or not want to think about it but the truth is like if we have that paperwork that shows like okay let's fucking like sit down we got these fucking like we can knock out like four or five of these assignments real quick yeah i mean and you guys can do it like we can all fucking do it it's just like we need to be like working together and kind of using all of our resources because these kids are fucking snaky motherfuckers you know yeah yeah i agree like i'm not in the audience about yeah so i mean we got to use our fucking smart powers what ashton wants to do volleyball this next quarter and it's like a hundred dollars do you think you could split that with me yeah yeah hell yeah um yeah it's fucking really cold it's like fucking negative 14 i don't know maybe i don't know i don't know but like honestly i don't want to fucking have this tension with brandon well it doesn't have to be there we just need to fucking communicate like we're just not fucking saying anything about you doing a bad job i'm saying the opposite i'm saying you're overworked and you have like a like a huge workload and like there's no way that you're going to be able to accomplish that without us working together i mean if we work together and fucking nothing really has to change but like that's what needs to change is like we just need to actively be using our resources and communicating and keep working because if we're not then it's like fucking yeah that a house divided cannot stand well you know i was like i still do the stuff that like you whatever implemented like i the kids still like have to make sure that their rooms are clean on fridays like i have them helping out around the house and like you know like i'm not just like letting them fucking do whatever the fuck they feel like like i feel you're you're clearly feeling attacked and i apologize that wasn't my intention but we just i don't feel as much i just are you okay yeah listen i'm sorry kiana i didn't mean to come at you with fierceness or anything i thought it was pretty chill but i'm it's not does he ever fucking get in my period okay don't take it personally shark week shark week yeah uh well i'm gonna make some fucking food i'm hungry all right uh you have to call it or something all right all right",

    "transcript": "You ever get a chance to look up those things? No, I was having to do this. Let's do it right now, though. I was just wondering, because I meet with my CPS lady tomorrow or tomorrow or the next day. I don't know which one, but. Say the word again, family. Parenting classes. All of our parenting classes. OK, I see one, right? That's like. This course is referred to as parenting skills class. Child endangerment course child abuse class for court mandated parenting program. And I guess you got it. You got to pay like, so basically this, this looks like a court approved one. Like, I mean, you could do something different, but then I might tell you to do this anyways. So this course should not be considered as a divorce parenting class or coparenting course. I conflict parenting program. I don't like that. What do you think? Which one? So what do you want me to find you a couple different options and then send them to you? Yeah, would you? Yeah, yeah, I can do that. I don't know if I should do. I don't know if I want to do one that's like. I don't know if I want to do one that's like. So what do you want me to find you a couple different options and then send them to you? Yeah, would you? Yeah, yeah, I can do that. I don't know if I should do. I don't know if I want to do one that's on child endangerment or just a parenting one overall. You know what I mean? Like, I feel like the parenting one would be better because it's like, you know, like this wasn't something that I like intentionally did to endanger my child. It's not like intentional to put them in danger, but it's like more, you know, more something that like, you know, a parent like like that you would learn in a skills class and it would benefit you. Whereas, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, I mean. I'll just show you. I'll just show you what I find. But what are you going to be? I'm driving right now. But I'll look at them. I'll look at them tonight. Okay. When are you going to be home? I'm driving. I'll look at them tonight. Okay. All right. All right. All right. When are you going to be home? When are you going to be home? When are you getting off work or whatever you're doing? Well, I was supposed to be off at 8, but somebody's mom or something collapsed, and fucking they ran out of work and didn't even say anything. They ran out and called the store and said what happened. And so they said that they needed me to close tonight because of the other night, the other day when I called in for this stuff. They're like, listen, dude, we didn't write you up. We didn't even say anything about it other than ask you if you were okay. We need you right now. So I fucking I told him that I would do it, but I had to go bring my son because I left the baby with fucking somebody who can only watch him until 8 p.m. So I was like, look, I can do it, but I need to go bring my son somewhere where he can be until 1 a.m. And they were like, that's fine. That's fine. So I just now left to go. I just picked up the baby and now I'm on my way all the way to Circle Pine. That's so far. That's kind of far away. You could have called me and I would have gone and got him. Yeah, I don't know. I just started panicking because like I know that they did. They did. You know, they did fucking. That's fucked up, dude. I called. Nobody does. I know what he calls in on. If you close and you have to call in like two days before. Otherwise you're fucked. You know, right. So nobody. Yeah. It's bad. You call in on a close and you're definitely getting written up. And I called in like literally an hour before my shift. And like, they didn't even give him an option. I'm just like, look, I'm not coming in. So I fucking I, I figured when this happened, it was a perfect opportunity to kind of like, you know, get my, you know, one up on him. So that way we're even again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you do work till close tonight then. Yeah. But we're off. It's not 2 a.m. It's one. Oh, okay. And then after work, I got to drive all the way to fucking circle pines. Damn. Okay. That's crazy. I know I'm pissed. I'm not going to make nothing tonight. My, my, at the end of the night, you need my tips between my tips and my fucking mileage that they gave me back or whatever. And my hourly dude, like break even because I just had to pay two babysitters now and I had to drive all the way to fucking circle pines from new hope and back and then do it again in a couple hours. Yeah. Like I'm not going to make a shit tonight. But whatever. Yeah. Prostitute prevention. Sorry. Okay. I'm going to finish reading this and I'll send it to you. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. All right. I'll see y'all. All right. Bye.",

This is B&H. How may I help you? Hi, this is Vernon Gillis. How are you doing? Good. How are you? I'm doing well. Are you the lady I spoke with this morning? Or it might have been Brianna? Yeah, it might have been Brianna. I know she's currently off the phones right now. What can I help you with though? Well, she was gonna have a conversation with me and Matthew Marcellus. And I'm just following up with that right now. Now, would you be able to help me with that? Or do I gotta wait for her? No, I should be able to help you with that. Where are you calling from? My name is Brandon Gillis. I'm with Generation Hope. And I'm calling on behalf of Matthew Marcellus, who I actually need to get on the phone line right now. If I could put you on a brief hold. Okay. Okay, one second. Oh, hey, good morning. Hey, I'm gonna add that person to the call right quick. Is that okay with you? Yep. Okay. Okay, there we go. All right. So good morning. This is Brandon Gillis. I'm calling on behalf of Matthew Marcellus, who's on the phone now. Matthew, I got a brief. Brianna, I think this is on the phone or I'm sorry. Michelle. Michelle. Hi, this is Michelle with Partners Behavioral Health Care. This is Matthew. Yep. Hey, Matthew, how are you doing this morning? Not too bad. Not too bad. Okay. So I'm just calling. We have processed your comprehensive assessment. I am ready to get you scheduled for the St. Cloud location intake. Do you have your own residence? No. Have you contacted any housing? I think he had said earlier that he was actually decided to go with the St. Paul. Is that correct? St. Paul. Well, I still got housing here, but I thought that was going to be like something like that was going to be difficult to do. So I could provide you some contact information for housing. If you'd like. Let's see what I have here. I mean, there was an email sent out to us on like Friday, either Thursday or Friday, kind of showing like a bunch of those resources. But if I recall, she was telling us like basically Matt had to make a decision whether he wanted to be up here or down there. And I don't know if he talked to you guys in between then and now, but he's told me that he had interest in going down to the St. Paul area. Okay. Yeah. If he'd like to go to the St. Paul area, we can get him scheduled for that as well. Sorry, I'm having a little issues right now with my housing sheet. You're totally fine. I can't really pull up. So I can, if he's interested in the St. Paul location, I can email you guys some housing information. Okay. Yeah. What's a good email that I can send this to? You can send it to my email and then I'll make sure that he gets it. I'll forward it to him as well. And the email is L-E-G-I-T-G-I-L-L-E-S at L-I-B-E dot com. Okay. And also you can probably just CC him anyways. Like his email is, it's his last name and then his first name. And then it was a 055 or? Yeah. 055. Marcellus055 at gmail.com. Yeah. MarcellusMatthew055 at gmail.com. Okay. Perfect. I'll CC him there as well. Okay. Cool. Cool. And then, so what, so our next steps are, just so we're super clear, you want us to review the information on the, that you're just about to email us and then we need to call them and then follow back up with you guys? Or is what, yeah, maybe walk me through that. We can get them scheduled right now, if you'd like. Just so you let housing know this client is scheduled for an intake. All of, then after he's scheduled for his intake, they will request a copy for his comprehensive assessment to see if he does meet criteria. So all of that would be sent to the housing. All of that should be funded through insurance as well. So let's see, what day should we get him scheduled for? I can't answer that. That's Matthew. As soon as we can. I mean, as soon as tomorrow. Okay. Let's see here. So I do have an opening for tomorrow at 8 a.m. Not sure if you might need a little bit more time for housing. It's just, it just depends with all of them. They're all different. But I do have tomorrow available at 8 for the St. Paul location. And now that's for like a phone screening thing or. So this I'll do my phone screening right now. And then you'll be you'll be scheduled for a comprehensive assessment and then an intake. So when you say that, that'll be all in one. So that'll be all in one. Correct. And I'll have to go down to the St. Paul location. Yep. If you're doing in-person programming. Yes. And then you'll start programming that day. And this is the outpatient, right? Yep. Intensive outpatient. Okay. I mean, all right. And then is there like anything. So, like, specifically, like, I know that he did a CD assessment with you with sobriety first. And like, but when they sent out his assessment to another place, you know, we called that place and we did the phone intake over there, this place. And this lady, I don't know if they were like, I don't know, kind of weird there. And they're like, just super trying to get them in to go inpatient because of a money thing. I don't know. But like, is there certain things that he should say and should not say in order to, like, make. You know what he wants to happen. I don't know. So, I mean, I'm, I'm unsure with that. You just have to call housing and answer the questions, honestly, on the screening. And then. But. So they'll do their screening, but they are going to request a comprehensive assessment. So the one that we complete upon intake, they'll request that. And then if they meet the criteria. Then it'll be considered for the free state board and large. And if not, some have self pay. We do also have GRH. Group residential housing that the client and the assessor or counselor will have to send a professional statement of need and send it to the county. And then we'll just have to wait to hear back from the county. So, I'm, I'm, I'm curious as to, is there a place with, with lodging outings here in St. Cloud or no. And St. Cloud, it's a, it's a bit more tough. I think. No, not as much. No. Did you have more resources for the St. Paul location or contact information for St. Paul change place? You could try calling St. Cloud. Yeah. For St. Cloud, you could try calling change place. Okay. All right. All right. So, I think we're cool. You're going to do some sort of phone intake with him right now, then. I'll do a screening if he'd like to get scheduled for tomorrow at eight. I just don't know if that gives him time to contact housing. If he wants to do that. Some might have a waiting list, but we could schedule him for tomorrow at eight. If that works for you, Marcellus. Yeah, I'll need some kind of guarantee if I'm going to go down there. Okay. It's going to take me an hour and a half to get down there. Right. Say that one more time. It's going to take me an hour and a half to get down there. Okay. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Say that one more time. It's going to take me an hour and a half to get down there. Okay. If you want, we could get you on for January 28th at 11am. Seems more feasible. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that gives us enough time to get housing figured out down there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, that'll work. Let's see. They reject me for any reason, and then I don't know. I'm not sure if I would even have a way to come back up here. If you want to give Change Place a call first for the St. Cloud location. Yeah, that's where you originally want to stay. I could provide you contact info and an email. Okay. I could call them, but I think we should, you know, because I'll have a couple days either way then. So we'll do the screening now, and then we'll schedule for the thing in St. Paul on the 28th at 11. And then I'll see if Spray or if Change Place is available. If not, then I'll proceed with going to St. Paul. Alrighty then. Well, I'll email you housing information for St. Paul right now. Same with your referent. And then you're all set for 11 a.m. So just keep calling housing, and hopefully they have something available for you. Yeah. All right, perfect. Thank you. All right. Yep. All right. I'm going to do my screening on you here. What is your drug of choice and last date of use? Alcohol. And I was listed the other day. And your last date of use? The other weekend, so that was probably like... You're cutting out. Is that a weekend? Eight or nine. Yeah, like a little over a week ago. Okay. Do you have medical marijuana? No. Okay. I do also see that last date of use for marijuana was the 13th. So just keep in mind that if there's no medical marijuana, they will be watching for the levels to drop. Yep. Let's see here. Do you have any legal involvement? No. Any medications? No. And have you had any recent suicidal or homicidal ideation? No. Okay. Okay. All right, sir. Well, I will be sending you an email, same with your referent, with the date and time of your appointment, housing information, and our address. Sounds good. All right. Have a great rest of your day, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. All right. Hey, Matt. I'll probably catch up with you. I don't know what my schedule looks like today, but maybe I'll try to get you into the office today at some point. All right, man. All right. Take care. Sounds good. Bye. Bye.",

This is Erin. Hey, Erin, this is Brandon Gillespie, how are you doing? Good, how are you? I'm doing marvelous. Huh, that sounds like no. No, no, we're good, we're good. I was actually giving you a call, and I hate to sound like a nag or something like that, but I guess my office people, one of my bosses reached out and had told me that the ROIs from you guys never came in or something like that. And I'm also speaking for, let me see this, Dagan Lessart, and then Derek, I can't remember what his last name is, I don't know why I didn't write it down. I think it's Derek Nelson, maybe. Okay, well, I need to know the last name, because I don't know, I can't remember who came in Friday. Okay, I can tell you, one second. No problem. And the other one, Dagan, he did not get it done on that day, so someone else came in and was kind of belligerent and being disrespectful, and Dagan said, you can take my spot, and I'll come back later. So I don't know if he's coming back this Friday or what that looks like. We did wait around a four for him and had somebody else lined up in case he needed to get it done. But he did not come back. Okay, okay. So you might want to reach out to him just to make sure that he's still going to come on Friday, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, all right. Okay, so I did get that name. So it's Derek Miller. Okay. And then the third one was a virtual one, Phoenix Munson. Okay, let me look. Derek, what is... I feel like, could you tell me? I feel like it's this one, 326. Okay. Okay. Okay. Karen sent over the assessment at 102 on 125. So you might want to look and see if it's there. And it says it was sent. So that's where I'm like, I know that the system doesn't always send out and that's what I was checking. But that one says it was sent. The one for Phoenix? The one for Gillis. No, the one for Miller. Sorry, Miller. Okay, on 122, it was sent. The assessment in the IRO... On 125, it was sent because he didn't even come here until 124. Okay. Let me see, Derek Miller. Assessment. Let me see. Fax log says 125 at 102. The assessment was sent out. And it was sent by fax? Yeah. Oh, yeah. And the ROI? Karen sent it out. Do we have the... I bet you we didn't send the ROI, but I will. Let me look at that. Derek Miller. Okay, I'll send that one over right now. Where is it? Oh. That's why I'm like, fuck, Derek. Yeah. Where did she send it? We have it together in the car. There you go. You know what, Karen, that's the one. There's others... Is that... No, okay, if you know the power mode, it's by LYNX. Okay, and I just sent the release for that one. And we actually do not have a release of information for the other one, so I can't give it to you. Hold on. Um, let's see. I do have an email that you can send it to her. Whenever you can find time in between doing what you're doing... I have to have her contact me. Okay, one minute. I'll talk to you in a second. Okay. I'm sorry. What did you say, just now? I would have to have her request that. Oh, okay. Okay, I understand. All right, I'll have her contact you guys. Contact you guys. Can I put you on a brief hold? I can probably get her on the phone. Yeah, no problem. All right, one moment. I'm down in Arizona, so... I'll be chilling. The subscriber you have dialed is not in service. Mike's uncle died. He was living in the house. I put in a trust when we passed their house because they invested a bunch of money into it. We left the house. We got him. We had him. Hello? Hello. Hey, I'm going to add you to a call. Is that okay? You got a what? I'm going to add you to a call, like a three-way call. With who? The place that did your assessment. Oh, okay. Yeah, they're saying that I need to... You need to request an ROI for my company. Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. Who does it release it to? Me. My company can talk to the company. Oh, okay, okay, okay. Do I just have to talk to them or are they going to send me something? They're going to send you something, but... Because I'm in the middle of setting up a new phone right now. Okay, here, one second. I'll call you right back, but, yeah, once you tell them to send it... Hey. Hurry up and do it, though, because I'm in the middle of fucking setting up a new phone right now. My phone's going to be shut off in, like, a couple minutes because I just transferred my number. Okay, all right, just give me one minute. And if I don't answer, then do it again in, like, five, ten minutes. Okay, all right, bye. Uh... Okay. I don't know why that three-way call didn't work, but are you still there, Erin? Yeah, I heard it. I heard her. Oh, you did hear her? Oh, that's... Yeah, you heard her. She couldn't hear you. No, that's okay. What? An email for her? I need to... Yeah. Okay, I can give you that. Hold on a second. This is not working. Why is this not working? I think we probably don't have... I don't know. You got it back? Not sure. Okay. Hold on. Fuck, Erin. I don't know. Maybe it's the... I don't know. I don't believe you either. Oh, it's this one? Yeah. Yeah. All right, here's the one that's supposed to come up. Okay. We're dealing with a whole bunch of lines. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hold on. Okay. I don't know why mine doesn't... Oh. Let me figure out where you're going. Yeah. Okay. So, I can send it over to her via email. She has to send it... Like, sign it and send it back to me. Yeah. Right? So, if she doesn't get it and she doesn't sign it... Okay. She's... Hold on. ...texting me her email. Even though I just emailed her recently, it's not popping up for me. Okay. Yeah. I don't know. Yeah. Hold on. Okay. No, he's in with his intake. Yeah. Okay. I don't know. Yeah. We'll figure it out. We'll figure it out. I don't know. Okay. The email I have is, like, Parker Michelle. Yeah, that's the one. Zero to zero. Yeah, that's the one. That email. Yeah. Okay. Got it then. Okay. So, I sent that over to her. So, all she has to do is sign it and send it back, and then I can send it over. But if I don't receive it, I can't do anything. Totally. Totally understand. All right. All right. And all right. Okay. Oh, so, all right. So, we already went over Derek, but you said the assessment was faxed to the Generation Hope office on 125 at noon? Yep. At 1. Like 105. Okay. And was the ROI taken care of? I just sent that over. Oh. So, it should be. I sent it by a fax, not your. Not your. Percentage or whatever. Not your email, yeah. Okay. Okay, cool. All right. Then I think that's all I need for now. Thank you so much, Erin. Yeah, not a problem. All right. I hope you have a wonderful day. Have a good day. Yeah, you too. Bye. Bye.",

So I guess that's what the plan is as soon as we leave here, cause he had to drop his bike off to get some maintenance done on it. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And then you're going to meet up with Tia and grab that stuff. I'm like, God, baby, why are you so messy? I don't know. Do you even want me to like grab this stuff? Like, cause, um, I mean, I was thinking immediately, like, I, first of all, I don't want to like go through a bunch of stuff, but I mean, if there is like something in there, like I might take like one or two things, but like for the most part, I'm just going to bring it to my office and for the donation. What if there's things that I want in it? Well, that's what I was asking you for. Well, I don't know. I don't, she hypes it up. I don't know what is in the bag. I can't tell you yes or no. Like, yeah, grab this and this and this. I don't know what's in it. So yeah, if you want to bring it home and we can go through it and then you can bring it back to work and put it up for donations. But yeah, I mean, just don't, I mean, I'm sure you won't let her, but she was like, yeah. And then I got these shoes and gas money. If Brandon will take me to Alec. I was like, I don't think that's a good idea. And I don't know if Brandon's trying to do that. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. And that's way too much. And I'm pretty sure, like, I don't know if she was trying to explain it to me, but I'm like, I'm pretty sure you're not allowed at Luke's legally. Right. So I don't think it's a good idea for us to drive you there. Yeah, I know. And she's like, well, I'm getting it paid now. I was like, right, right. I'm like, legally, if it's still not okay, I don't think you should go there. Yeah, no kidding. What baby? Dude, the baby point, like, fucking scary people in a movie. They weren't point. Baby. Just like, yeah, he pointed over somewhere. Like, a fucking alien or a ghost is here. Yeah. Yeah. These things. Is his maintenance going to be done tonight? I don't think so. I think we're just dropping it off. Oh. Oh, I don't get it. Yeah. So I'm. All right, sweetheart. So, like, you should be leaving, like, within an hour. Yeah, hopefully. Or less. Okay.

Um, yeah, I was gonna ask you, um, if you could, are you working this week? Um, hold on, stupid question. Uh, can you get it? Huh? Well, I was trying to get, uh, yeah, that's a, that's what I was asking. Thank you. Um, how much do you sell me a, a, a quarter, a QP for? First off, what do you mean by a three way? Who else are you trying to put on this phone call? Dan, like I didn't, he just told me to call you just not without him on the phone, but I was gonna like call, call you. And that's that dude that lives far away? Yeah. Okay. Well, what are you going to give it to him for? I don't know. I was gonna have him give me probably at least like $200 extra just for driving out there. But, and that's like kind of a deal because he's also giving me an ice house. Yeah. Well, I mean, so it just, uh, I don't know. How do you want to swing it? Cause I, as long as I'm making something, I don't really care. Um, I gotta see, um, cause seven, seven, 15, something like that. Yeah. And I, and that's how much that's, uh, you would be making money if you were sold it to me for that. Well, I mean, eight. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. I would be making money. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I'd love to do it. Yeah. Um, let me make sure I got it and then, uh, well, let me see how much, yeah, it should be, should be, um, yeah, when I probably pick it up tonight and I bring it up to him tomorrow after I go to work. I got to work since I'll be on St. Cloud. Um, and when, um, are you going to drop off the money or when am I going to have the money? Um, so I would go up there and actually I'm going to make like before I like, um, I'm going to fucking try to tell him to fucking send it to me like right away because that would be like the best, but he's like, yeah, I'm on like half of what you're getting. That's what I mean. That's what I meant to say. But so you make it legit. Yeah. Make it, uh, make it would be, that'd be cool if we did that. Cause yeah, he said that, um, he'd pay a thousand for a quarter, a QP. So if you were to sell it to me at eight and I just still give you, uh, the 200. Yeah. Yeah. That'd be cool. Well, no, I don't need it all. No, you got to make some too. What the fuck? Yeah. Well, I'm going to tell him and you're doing all the work and you're driving. So as I said, I'll split half of it with you. So you do the math. Yeah. But you're letting me run with this. I mean, it's kind of like we're working together on this. Yeah. What is that? How's your day been by the way? Oh, it's good. I'm a little busy right now. Yeah. I'd be picking it up either tonight or, uh, probably in the morning or something, but it's your preference. But my, the idea is I'd be dropping it off after work and you want to give me a call back? Dropping it off for the work tomorrow? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Call me back. Well, no, no, no. I don't really care what you do or however, whatever. Um, I'm going to call you back as soon as I got the word. Yes, you got it. Um, yeah, that I got it, which I know it's probably good. Okay. Oh yeah. Just leave me one of your kids. I'll hold them collateral. Which one do you want? I can't decide. Ashton's really good. Ashton will do felonies with you and it'll seem like a family event. She seems like my little whatever, her old dog, but yeah, anyway, I'll call, uh, call me. Um, I'll call you as soon as, well, she's messaging me right now. Yeah. Um, which is, you know, um, no, she's only got two on her. Yeah. And I mean, I got, I got one, so I just need one more. Um, let me just see if she can do three. I know this bitch has got it too. She's a little hustler. She knows that she gives it to me for two and she's going to get more. Anyway, I'll let you know. Okay. All right. Bye.",

So, I mean, I'm lying at 745, but you have to be like, you'd have to be here by like way early. Like seven. Seven. Yeah. All right. I can do that. Yeah. All right. There's no take backs. I got you. Well, yeah, of course. Yeah. Right. And unless there's like something wrong with it, then I'll bring the whole thing back. Yeah. Well, she's just a fucking. I mean, there's nothing wrong with it.

Okay, all right, well, yeah, that was, and so the thing about the car thing, huh, that's, so it was determined that he did get out of that blue car? Yep, yep, him and the girlfriend left, and she, she was, I'm assuming, was green? No, he was, oh, he was, no, he was with the girlfriend, that's what Nick told me yesterday, because they went in the ditch, and he got out of the car, and started walking, and she hitched a ride from somebody that picked her up, and Nick's sister is mad at the girlfriend, and Nick keeps on telling her to just have faith, you know, like, she loved him more than anything besides you, type of thing, yeah, so.

Oh, no, I was basically the same. I mean, I, I might try to wake up like right around like, I don't know, 7 730 is like what I try to shoot for. But like, yeah, I don't know since I fucking kind of stayed up a little extra late last night. Some days are here. Yeah, I find it up sleeping until like almost 11. Yeah. Oh, wow. Wow. That's a pretty that's a that's what people call late nights. Hey, I remember that. Yeah, I fucking stayed up pretty late. But I should probably start getting on schedule or something. I don't know. Hey, probably help me out. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, yeah, whatever. I think. Yeah, work. I could pick something in your mind that you want to like kind of work towards. And, and even if it fucking sucks, like doing or working towards like making a little fucking steps to get there is kind of like, it's definitely good. Definitely fucking healthy. That's what I need to do. I need to figure out what to at least do with my fucking time. If I am going to use it. Again, if I am going to sit there and just take up a bunch of time with fucking just staying up and going fucking nuts. Yeah. Yeah. It just so happens, I'm pretty good at helping people out figuring out some of these things. I mean, so I guess if you're open to it, we can fucking figure out kind of like what's what's like a good fucking game plan. And what's what may be nice. So let's say so think about like, I don't know. So I one of the things I use my personal experience that I get a lot of these things to kind of help me make some assumptions. And if you're anything like me, which I think we've kind of found that we do have a lot of similarities. Like, like one thing that I fucking like to avoid is like, like applying or like making a plan to do something that I already kind of know is going to fucking fail and kind of like, I don't take the wind out of my sails. I mean, for example, like, let's like, let's find maybe something to do for you. Like that's related to like computer work or something, something that you can basically you can manage yourself. You're your own boss. And like, you can make money at it. Like at your own will. That'd be fucking amazing. I mean, because if you can do if you could find something like that, that you can do like that, that takes away like, okay, now you don't you're not getting in trouble for a fucking showing up late. You're not getting in trouble because you're not fucking punching the clock on time. Like, your work isn't up to performance like you're your own boss. So it's like, you are. That'd be fucking insane. Yeah, that'd be great. Yeah. Well, you said you have a computer, right? Yeah. And like you, but you mainly in the past of this kind of your your kind of go to thing is your music. So is that like something you do like where your leisure center? Yeah, I mean, I have like, I have Pro Tools, like a V and a fucking I don't know, I just got paid a subscription. So I can't even use it right now. Yeah. Yeah, I know. That's what sucks is a lot of these cool things out there fucking cost money. I've spent so much fucking money. Yeah. Takes up half my damn computer space. And I'm sitting there just like, I don't want to delete it because it takes fucking forever. Yeah. Um, but you said that you're you. I think I heard you say at first, but like doing stuff with like AI, like kind of making money with AI somehow. Yeah, I would like to win. I just like I, I have AI stuff with like, I don't know, necessarily. That's my struggle with like, fucking nose. I just know there's this whole what the fuck. I don't even know the search up bro. Ah, like, so search up some and fall down a rabbit hole. I literally don't even know the search up. Oh, man, I've got an idea for you. So, have you ever heard of replit? R E P L I T. Um, I don't know about you. Yeah, R E P L I T. So that's like, that's like a program that works like it works on your phone, it works on a computer, like you can download an app, or but basically as long as you make an account, like you can work on projects. And you can work on projects and, and like leave it, you can start something and you can leave it and you come back you can like do whatever. And like, typically, when you first, if you've never used it before, you can like go on there you can create an account, you can do like the free, free month of like pro features. And, and so basically, yeah, basically, if you never signed up, or you've never used this email to sign up, then yeah, I would do that. And, and honestly, like if you like with a replit, I've used their shit a lot. And like, and then I'd like run up a month. And then I'd fucking like just create another account under a different email address and I'd fucking do the same thing. Yeah, that's what I'd be doing on things like that. Yeah. But, um, so I, there's even like, there's even a fucking thing on there on replit called bounties. And you can like navigate to it. When you get a chance and I'll like fucking I'll also I'll like send you a text message with some of these links to like kind of follow up and and like kind of bookmark it or whatever. And, yeah, but look up like replit, and then download. Yeah, bounties. Because some bounties are basically like people will go on replit and they're like, Okay, I need like an app for my business made, and I'll pay $200 for it. Or I need this done, and I'm willing to pay X amount of money for like, yeah, or maybe you got to fix something or something like that there's like just a wide variety it's basically like the Craigslist of like, like, you know, little shit. And some of us, some of us more challenge some of us challenging some of it's not, but like the trick of replit is like, you have that, that AI to basically help you. So you is. So what I would do is like I would like put, I would like take the like if there's like a bounty and if there's a description, I would like copy and paste that description into a separate chat, like outside of replit and be like okay this is my, this is my problem this is my goal these are the details that I have to work with. Now create a prompt that can help. If I can, you know, fix this or do this or whatever. And you might even want to be proactive and be like, give me three prompts, instead of just one. And basically try to fucking, you know, have it do it all on its own. And, and you'll find that it's actually like, it's really fun to mess with but I think like if you're anything like me, if you're trying to make money on it. Don't do your own projects, like, because you'll, you might find like something fascinating that you want to do, but it's really easy to get fucking sunk into that thing and you're like, oh shit, I didn't even really realize I was supposed to be doing that other thing. I just, I just looked at my computer screen trying to figure out this thing and for nine hours. Whoops. Hey, if it catches you like that, that means obviously something that's calling you. Yeah. Yeah, no, I do have a couple of fucking passion projects that are actually pretty cool. Like, like for example, I don't know if I told you this but I record all my phone calls. So what I, and I've recorded all my phone calls for like the last like eight or nine years. So I created this program that basically it takes my, my transcripts, and it like turns them into like actionable fucking information so that like every call after every call I get like a report of like, these are the key takeaways and this is like what are some action items and some to do things. And it's, and like, yeah, no, it'll even take like if, if me and you were to say like October 9th, like right now, just because I said that it's going to ask me at the end of the day if I want to add that to my calendar or not. October 9th. Yeah, just a crazy example but now I'm going to literally see that at the end of the day I'm like what the fuck am I talking about. All right. Yeah, I downloaded Ripley I'll give you, I'll give you a look. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So I mean, I appreciate that. Yeah, and, and I think like, you know, I totally would understand like if you're, if you have, if you're kind of self conscious about like the idea of pursuing something like this because like you're, it doesn't seem tangible it doesn't because it's not putting your money in your hand right this second, and it's not conventional, like because you're not fucking, you know, welcoming people as they come into Best Buy like, you know, and you have to try to remind yourself like that, doing stuff like this as a business owner, like you're not in the days of fucking wearing McDonald's shirts and fucking it's over. Yes. I sure pray. Maybe by me like, like staying with you and like continuing to ask questions and kind of like, just do the back and forth thing like that could be like the perfect thing that you need to kind of keep focused and make it actually happen. Say what. Because I, I just feel like I need direction a lot of the time. Yeah. Like I know like I can get it done. It's just, I don't know. I like motivation sometimes. Like I motivate everyone to the point where I don't have any for myself. Absolutely. I'm the same way. I fucking, you know, if I had would add somebody to fucking like just stay on me for a while and like, hey, like, how's this going? I don't know. It honestly like and but learning like that like I fucking learned that that's how I need to be. I just need to be kind of taught sometimes like it helped me and fucking like become a better contractor. Like, after the job was done, like on the way home, because I have to ride with the fucking my partner or whatever, like after the on the way home instead of talking about like what we wanted to talk about or like listening to music or something like that. We talk about like details of the job and like, oh, what we're going to do tomorrow and like, you know, it'd be cool if we could do this and but and by just doing that, like if I can, I could see the major improvement in my skills. Like, you know, yeah, I don't know. So it's weird. Hey, I understand that, though, because it opens room to to have your mind already think about growth for the next day. I, you know, I feel like it's good to focus on the future if you don't get lost in it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Man, I don't know. You're obviously super fucking smart. And and honestly, I don't I don't really believe that you need my help in order to be successful. And because I have faith that you're going to fucking be successful, whether I'm a part of it or not. Oh, I mean, I mean, that's something that I, you know, I twist my brain about. I'm like, what the fuck? Do I even? What did I do in life? I don't fucking know. I mean, I do know, but I don't like really to be quite frank is I I just sit there and I'm like. I just I used to walk around a lot like this to fucking. I just feel like I was doing something. I would just walk all day, especially in the summer. I walk all day long. I didn't ride a bike all day long. Like, that's all I do. Yeah. Yeah. No, I feel that I fucking know exactly what that's like. Well, I was at the fucking shelter in Anoka, but I didn't have anybody or anything to do except for just like do little baby steps. And I would like walk around everywhere. I had such a good time that fucking summer. Yeah, I feel you. I was outside a lot this summer. Yeah. But yeah, I'll give it. I'll give it a look. I'll reach out and yeah, I'll fill you in. I'll talk. Talk about it. I was. I think I need to go to fucking was today, but it's the next one is if you could do Thursday. I really need to do a food show. The Salvation Army. Yeah. Okay. And you said the one the next one's on Thursday. Yeah. Okay. You know what and what what time do they run it on Thursday? It is 1030 and 1 p.m. Or is 9 a.m. To 1030 a.m. And 1 p.m. To 240 p.m. And most of the time I be fucking getting into the office like, I don't know. I think the earliest I'm ever in the office is like 930. It's probably them when almost half of them gets hit or one fucking them. I don't know. I feel like arms opens up pretty. I don't know. I forgot what it was. I think it's like, I don't know. It's early, but it's just a weird time like eight or nine. It's at that nine o'clock hour. So you said what was the afternoon want times? 1 p.m. To 240. Okay. Okay. So I'll put I'll put it in for one 1 p.m. Thursday. Dakota. Dakota. Yeah. All right. Yeah. What do you got? What do you got going on? Yeah. What do you got going on tonight? Oh. Tonight and tomorrow. Nothing really. You don't got it because you should come with me to that Wednesday meeting. It's like, I don't know. It's like, I don't know what the fucking building is. It's like right in the middle of fucking town, though. Like, all right. Yeah, I can do that. Yeah. I said I would. Cool. Cool. Yeah. And it won't be as bad as you think it is. Like, they got, like, the first part of it is, like, kind of like what you would assume a meeting would be like. But the second half of it, like, you're chilling on couches and fucking just just fucking kind of talking about your day. Like, it's not even that, like, super low key. I bet. Yeah, I do that. Okay. Let's see. Salvation. Salvation. My fucking sister is in town, dude. Yeah. It's not good, though. Why? I don't know. So, like, I so I got an older sister. Right. And she's crazy. Right. So she and she is pretty crazy. Like, I don't know. She's like one of those people, like, and I'll tell this to her face, too. But she's one of those people that never should have done drugs ever, because, like, she used to be normal, you know, like, once upon a time, like, her name is Tia. Tia used to be normal. But, man, then she turned 18 and she got, like, this fucking, I don't know, like, $40,000 fucking settlement from when she was, like, hurt when she was a kid. And her and her boyfriend moved down to Florida and spent $40,000 and, like, Nadia, like, a month and a half, like, two months. Holy fuck. And they spent it all on fucking meth. Yo. Yeah. That is a lot. I don't know. I wouldn't even know what the fuck. I wouldn't even. I would definitely fucking probably die. I don't know. Yeah. I would say so. A lot of just crazy, crazy, crazy shit happening all the time. And sometimes me being, like, the youngest brother, like, I don't know. She was, like, the only one that was, like, hey, but what about Brandon? And I don't know. I just fucking feel that. And that and, like, I don't know. If somebody were to ever hurt me, she would, like, fucking stab them, like, for real. And I don't know. For some reason, in my fucking toxic brain, like, I equate that with, like, how I understand love. And. Yeah. I mean, I guess I do as well. Yeah. But she's in town. So she's also she's, like, I've fucking I've gotten high with her a fucking thousand times. And in fact, like, one of those times I fucking well, I don't know. Not one of those times. Just I've gotten high with her a bunch. And and I don't want to fucking do that with her. So I, like, yeah, I don't. That's why I don't see her anymore. Like, because we're estranged now. And so, like, she calls up Gabby, you know, my partner. And she's like, like, hey, Tia is trying to get ahold of you. I'm like, OK, well, send her to my voicemail. And I know I'm kind of an ass, but I send her to my voicemail. Yeah. And then she's like and then Gabby's like, well, she's in she's in St. Cloud. And I was like, yeah. And and she's like, she wants you to, like, look at these clothes and pick up grab this food and whatever the fuck and give you this money. And I'm like, what the fuck? I was like, well, just tell her to bring it to the office, man. I don't want any of that shit. And and then I got to know what one thing led to another. And I'm like, and she ended up calling me. And I was and it was right after I dropped you off. It was right after I dropped you off. And. Sorry, one second. OK, yeah. And yeah, right after I dropped you off, I had to go pick up a different some a different somebody. And I asked their permission. I was like, hey, is it OK if you come with me? My sister is in town. She wants to see me. Like, but I think it'd be better if, like, you know, the both of us went because I don't really want to go by myself. And and I don't know. So we ended up going to pick her up eventually and brought her to Savers. And I don't know. It was just like, she's cool. I mean, it was super cool, but I can't tell. I can't. She says that she's sober. And then the guy I was with is like, yeah, I mean, well, she if she's staying at this, like, what is this, St. Mary's or something like that? Like, yeah, if she's staying over there, then I know that they drug test over there, so maybe she is sober. But then, like, she made some like, you guys want to get high? And Red's like, yeah, I do. I'm like, no, there's no fucking way. There's no fucking way I'd be doing drugs with one of my clients. Dude, I was like, I'll fucking lose my job. Fucking get like everything. Yeah, that's all bad. Everything. Hey, I'm not gonna lie. The red's somebody that I don't know. Like, I stayed in my first sober house with a little bit of fucking, you know, he went over to got transferred where my mom stays. And like, I don't know. Apparently, like, he just said some shit to my mom that, you know, he knows that I know, obviously, because he knows who my mom is. And like, my mom's got a mouth. And, you know, I get it. But like, she'll tell me. I don't know. He's just awkward around me now. It's like he doesn't want me to bring it up. He's being overly like, overly like here you can have said I locked his hat, bro. And he says, take songs. I hear you have you have it. I already know what the fuck it's like. He thinks I've been going to them. I put a bite in his ass or something. I don't, you know, I just I'm not that stuck on me. Yeah, I don't. You know, that's really weird. You say that because if I can and one of the so like my sister's her fucking you can super clearly tell her love language is like giving and receiving gifts. And, and like I mentioned that. Yeah, red red was like, yeah, that's mine, too. He's like, I like to I like to give people stuff. Like, I don't know. Just not just like, but like special stuff. He's like, you know, if you got a thing for Star Wars, and like you, I can come across like, you know, the Star Wars figurine or something like that. Like, I'll take it and I'll like, hold on to it. And until I see you again, and I'll give it to you. And that way, it's like something special. He's good people. Um, it almost shocked me when I don't know why. Yeah, he's good people. He's good people. I've seen on, you know, I just, I don't know. It's good. But that is my love language as well. I give, I give, I give, I give, I give, until I no longer have it anymore. And now I'm like, yo, just over give. But, you know, that'll be something I'll never stop. It's okay because, you know, I'll get it back eventually. And if I give, and I got to go through something where I don't have, and I end up not getting, you know, it just, it'll come back again. So I don't, I just look at it as a lesson I'm supposed to learn. Something like that. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I feel the same way. Yeah. But I did learn that you, you got to be careful who you spend your time with. If that's the case. Yes. True. Very, very true. And I learned that because then some people will see that only come around to use you. And I, I don't know why I had to separate myself, like, kind of not really from a lot of people. But at the end of the day, I hate, I hate stressing about money. Money doesn't rule me. Money doesn't make me damn happy. I mean, it does, but like, you know, having money is all right. Not having money is all right as well. Until it gets to the point where you're like, fuck, bills, fucking court fines, fucking shit. This is the world that I'm into. And you're like, all right. But like, I don't like stressing about money. I don't like having to do that. So like here recently, it's just been, I don't know, a lot of self-reflection of like, you know, I was stuck my neck out with so many fucking people this year. And like, I mean, even though, like, I've been a different person than I ever have this year. And I have looked out and like forgiven a million times and then still get like fucked over. It's what builds me and helps me see that there's not many like that. So instead of using that as not many is like me and like, I'm just not going to do it no more. And I'm just going to be a dickhead and shit. I just, I just still like motivate me to still keep being me. Like, even though I might not have enough then, like, you know, I still do the little things like fucking make somebody dinner. Use my EBT or some shit. Or fucking use my EBT on a guy that fucking fought like, dude, just went in there and drained my last little bit I had. And then was just like, okay, just move on with it. Like some things don't affect others like that. And like, I sit there and I'm just like, bro, if I fucking heard how much EBT somebody had, I would just, you know, I don't feel comfortable even with somebody having a lot and using it still. It would be in my consciousness not to fucking drain that. But some people just, some people are just fucking, I don't know, bro. I don't even like to talk bad about people. I just baffle myself for so fucking long the point where I'm just like, yo, I'm just going to let that be. And I don't like letting a lot of people just be because, you know, like, what's the point of even meeting some people? And I guess that's where the lesson part comes in. If they're not going to stick around a little, and that's what pisses me off. It's really not hard. It's like, I don't have bad intentions, but these fuckers will sit around with people with bad intentions all damn day and be okay with it. They be one good person that doesn't have a damn bad intention, and they look at every damn thing as, like, I don't know. It's like they're trying to damn pin me for fucking being a bad person because they're not identifying like that. They just can't accept what a good person is. And I used to be the same way. I used to not be able to accept what, like, acts of kindness were. And if they were in a good, like, place, like, if they were in a good damn position for it, like, they didn't have no bad intention. You know, that's, I used to run away and so sabotage about those kind of things. So, I mean, I get it, but at the same time, like, I can only damn prove so much. Like, basically, I done, I literally had it all. I was dirty as fucking, I was damn growing, growing, growing, and I got us over living and everything. And then fucking, like, I just drained her and drained just to prove a point of, like, yo, I got you no matter what, bro. Until nobody had me, he kept. So, but that's just all part of character development and growth. And if I didn't go through that, I would still be, you know, that could hit me down later down the line. I wouldn't know how to handle it. So, in a more important time when I wouldn't even know how to handle it, I wouldn't experience that. So, that's where I use every situation is growth. It's helped me let go of a lot of things. It's helped me. I know my work just a little bit. It's helped me realize, like, yeah, I mean, really, I can only damn fight for something so long and somebody for so long. And then, like, really, I don't, I don't treat them bad. I don't talk bad about them, you know. But I'm just not going to, I'm not going to have the energy to fight for that. Like, when it's only about negative, people don't understand the positive, and they just damn want to go, go, go. I just give up. I'm just like, all right, come back around. You can, you can talk. And, you know, sometimes that happens, sometimes it don't. Yeah. Yeah. And it's important that you definitely don't forget to, you know, look out for numero uno. You ever watch, you ever watch Frank, Rick and Morty? Yeah. You know, that show's supposed to be, it was made for people that did acid and shit. Really? Really? The producers say, like, it was made for, like, psychedelics. Hmm. That's why they make the colors, like, so vibrant. Like, they put in, like, trinoma or whatever the fuck. It's some colorblind looking, it makes the fucking shit look brighter. But it, it pops for, like, LSD and shit, like, it's, I don't know, like, the producers did something. It was like, I don't know. It's like them looking at the walls when you're on DMT. People are saying you can see numbers with, like, a beam and shit. Yeah. Keeps on blowing up, but my, my sister keeps on fucking texting me, dude. I feel like I need to fucking OFP. I need to OFP this chick. What's OFP? What is that? Order for protection. Yeah. Dude, I don't know, man. You and I kind of look, like, a little bit alike. Maybe I'll introduce you to her. Actually, yeah, I can almost guarantee you, like, you might meet her fucking within the next couple of days. And she's cool, but she, she's like, oh, yeah, hey, cool, sweet. Like, oh, let me buy you a car. And you're like, okay. Okay. And then you're like, oh, shit. Let me buy you a car. Yeah. Holy fuck. Yeah, dude, she does that sort of shit. But then, like, you find out that, like, it comes with a black eye. What the fuck? Yeah, dude, she does. Yeah, dude, she does that shit, dude. She'll, she'll fucking, fucking. Well, that's a good heart thing. She'll fucking, like, terrorize me. Fucking, like, I remember I was on the side of the road. Fucking, like, I had to go, I had to go fucking steal, like, $800 worth of parts out of fucking O'Reilly's out of St. Cloud. And go fucking repair my truck while I was on the side of the road. And it was, like, 14 degrees out, and this was last winter. And I'm like, I had to, like, stay in the truck overnight because me and her got into a fucking fight. And so I slept in the truck overnight. And then, like, in the morning, I fucking, like, started doing the repair. And I fucking finally got the repair. And, like, then the cops show up. And they're fucking all, like, asking me questions. Fucking, like, like, somebody called and fucking said that you guys were fighting out here. So I don't, basically my sister had called the cops. And fucking, and then later on that day when I was like, fucking, I'm never talking to that bitch again. She fucking buys me a bunch of tools. Well, she doesn't actually buy it. She actually went in and fucking stole them all. And I was, like, thankful, but I'm like, what the fuck? Like, I feel like this is, like, this is, like. That means she cares even more because you put her freedom at risk. Man, it's the same as, like. So maybe that's her, that's her sign of maybe how she works through her transgressions with people. When she feels, like, she has, like, the feeling of remorse. You know, like, she feels, she feels like she needs to do something that would prove that she is sorry for her actions. But, like, she doesn't properly, might not know how to damn handle it. So, like, she does acts of her kindness, whether they're, you know, the most plaudible morally. But, you know, like, that's her way and maybe her communication of love and things like that are hurt, too. And, you know, I feel, I feel like maybe she just does that, you know, and then tries to correct them, her wrongs. Because, you know, not even perfect as a worker, nobody's perfect. But, you know, she's not always good at times. Like, you know, if I, if I went around, if I told, like, a lot of people what the fuck this goes on in my life. And filled everyone in on what everyone feeds me with bullshit every day. And, like, fucks my head up, fucks my trust, fucks my damn, my damn everything almost. And then I sit there and I have to go and, like, collect myself and, like, like, you know, get my headspace on before I damn have to call another person. And fucking damn take the chance of them coming and, like, just fucking doing the same thing and stir my head. I'd fill everyone's head with a bunch of them. It would be like me, I know it's like I could talk about it. But it's like I look out for other people, too, to the point where, you know, it's I was stressed in the fuck out. I would then I would do shit like that. So really, I didn't I'm not perfect at times. I'm not good at times to where I take my a lot of the shit that I do sometimes on the wrong person. Like, I take like I take it up just a notch on a person. I should have should have them took it a notch on before. And like I handle it wrong. And, you know, I always come back and like, you know, I admit to it. Back then, I wanted like back then I would just need a justifiable reason for an action that I did. Even if it was wrong, I would need like, well, this is why I did it and didn't have to be OK. But now I can just accept that, you know, I do wrongs and like my wrongs are wrong. I don't have to have a reason. You know, I can make a reason all day for why I did it. But that don't mean that reason was OK. And, you know, I show my I'm learning how to build my proper way of loving. And I'm learning how to build like adaptation to the same place is I'm not adapting anymore. I'm just climbing in, I guess. What was that word? Yeah, no, that word wasn't the right one. I don't know why your climax is. No, I'm fucking I'm just like acclimating. OK, acclimating. Yeah, I got you. I understand. I understand acclimating. I just haven't I haven't been in the same place for a long time. And this is the first time I have been in the same spot for a year. I've been in the same like state for the same year and just not moved and barely hardly moved outside of them. The south of St. Cloud's damn fucking area, like I didn't stay on the south side and would go to Walmart. And that would be a road trip for me. Why should you not? Like, I don't I don't know, bro. Like, I just was confined and still like kind of into these like perimeters around here. Because, like, dude, besides having to just survive and having to fucking stay my money all the time, money moves and fucking putting myself in a million damn places. I shouldn't be here. A million people. I shouldn't be fucking just going and going and going. It's like I do it for a reason because I have to. But like, you know, that stresses me the fuck out. You know, I just don't talk about it to nobody. So I just walk around with a smile, bro. And like at the end of the day, I don't handle shit nowhere near as half as I want to by the time I didn't reflect and look at it. And by the time I reflect and look at it and see how deep sometimes the way I handle things are and like how it could affect somebody else. It's already damn like I've already said, like an apology, but not like damn one. If I waited a little bit, it could have been one that actually made that person feel like I was sorry for it. So either like it just builds up in me still because I'm like, damn, bringing it up now is just like the point is turning it back up. And half the time I do that, so it doesn't it doesn't really vibe with people. People don't really vibe with it. So I just learned to reflect and reflect and reflect. And, you know, just behind closed doors, just drop it. I just give it to God, you know, because really I can't go crazy about it. And that's what I seem to do if I think about it too long. So my supervisor is calling me. You already call you when I get in the zone. OK, I'll give you a call. All right. All right. Yeah, no problem.",

I would say so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I just found out it was the water pump but the insurance company is trying to total the vehicle out which I don't care about. I really want to do that so I can try to get me something different but ain't no possibility of getting nothing different the way they charging everybody all this high-ass money for these hot, mild-ass cars on Facebook, right? So, how much would you charge to put the water pump on? I could tell you. Give me one second. What year? What year was that thing? It's a Chevrolet. Hey, you know, my boy up there at the up at the what's your name? Say you do it for 200 for me. Yeah, it's about the same, I think but it sounds like the same I would do it for But I got this little thing that will tell me you said it's what what year did you say it was? It's a 2000. I can't remember all everything else about it. Okay, that's fine. And I got it parked. I got it like a mechanic place. So, he said he ain't going to charge me for letting me know what was wrong but yeah, that's really nice of him. Huh? That's nice of him. Like, he must be one of your buddies or wait. Are you talking about at the auto zone place? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I see. So, it costs more of what you did, huh? No. Well, hold on a second. Let me just water pump. Man, it probably water pump going to cost me a lot to get to. Yeah. Yeah. So, I can probably do it for like probably like 175 is probably the best I can do. Okay. And then you will go right to the place and put it on for me. Yeah. Yeah. Once you got the part, then then I would put it on for you but yeah, I don't know if you want to get the part from like a like a junkyard or whatever. I mean, it might be like one of the better choices but I don't know. That's up to you. Yeah, the part can be expensive. Super. You you obviously don't want to buy it brand new because that's going to be **** extremely expensive I bet. Like how much you think? Alright, quiet without knowing the model of the vehicle it is for sure. Well, let me call dude. I'm going to call him and have him check and see. Okay. Okay. Alright, I'll call you back.

Aren't you supposed to be cleaning something right now? Aren't I supposed to be what? Aren't you supposed to be cleaning something right now? I'm cleaning the garbage out right now. How did you know? Yeah. Damn women. Fucking women. I thought you knew better. I know. How dare I take five minutes to call my friend while I take out the trash? Yeah.

You gotta understand, like, what's this thing I'm looking for? Self-preservation? Yeah, and there's babies involved. Man, there's always gonna be babies involved. Man, I want some more of my own babies. Yeah. I just had videos of a fucking burrito from when, like, we went to go visit the girls for the first time. Yeah. Yeah.

I want to work with kids. Still want to work with kids. Oh, yeah. You'd think I'd be sick of them by now, right? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I guess kids sometimes aren't that bad when they're, like, not your kids. Or, I don't know. I guess it kind of goes both ways, because, like, I don't know. Like, I only like my kids. Like, all the other kids in the world rub me the wrong way. Or annoying. Yeah. Yeah. Did I just hang up on you? No. Okay. Oh, yeah. So, I just came through, just got done cleaning the bathroom, and took the garbage out. I'm standing on the back steps, smoking a cigarette. Um, and gonna go inside.

Where can I go get, uh, it's gotta be, uh, like, uh, clinical tested, uh, UA. Where can I go get cheap UAs? Um, uh, there's this place called, um, what is it called, like, second chance UA, or something like that, or, um, um, I think it's, like, somewhere in the ballpark of, like, 20 or 40 bucks. Okay. That's not bad. That's not bad at all. Yeah, I think it's, like, I don't know, like, $36 to be exact, but that was, like, I don't know, eight years ago. Okay. I wonder if my health insurance will cover part of it. Yeah, it doesn't. Aw, damn. You would think they would, because, like, you know, you would think they would want you to be sober and shit. Well, I mean, yeah, I mean, they do. I mean, they would cover it if it was, like, a treatment facility giving you a drug test. Yeah. But, I mean, that's, like, one of those things that, like, is, like, you have to, like, go out of your way to, it's, like, an elective, like, you gotta, yeah, you gotta go out of your, like, say, if you, like, just pissed hot for, like, a drug test with your probation officer, they recommend you, like, go to this place and take a second test, like, on that same day so that, like, if you were to, like, you know, that way you could, like, bring it to court and be, like, hey, you know, like, I took a drug test right here today on that same day, and that proves that your drug test was incorrect. Tampered with, yeah. Alright, well, how long are you gonna be in the car and in Rogers for? I don't know. Hopefully not long. Like, I was, I don't know, it's, like, basically embarrassing if I were to tell you how long I've been waiting, but I've been, I was supposed to be here at 3, and I got here at, like, 2.50, and I've been, like, getting my phone and everything. Got on the phone and doing this. Have you even heard anything from them? Yeah. Okay. Excuse me, are you supposed to be on that phone? So, um, let me call you back here in, like, 10 minutes. Is that okay? Yeah, that's fine. Okay. Alright, I'll text you. Alright. Yep, bye. Bye.",

Um, but obviously I'm gonna, if that happens, you know, I'm gonna have to just run downstairs or do something, figure it out, you know, I think there is like one place I could probably go kick it. And I'm just like, it's kind of like halfway in between. It's like, basically in Champlin. Um, and, um, yeah, I mean, I could go over there and say, what's up for a minute and just kind of wait until you hear from him. And if it's like, if it's like, if it gets to be like seven or eight or some shit like that, then I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, I'll, um, yeah, I don't know.

I think if you don't have the last one, you fill them up with a big ass heater on it. Probably like, I don't know, if you were to keep that thing running, maybe like a day and a half, maybe two days. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll let you know. I was gonna say, I could probably pick it up for you, but I don't have a fucking thing with me. Yeah, I got money to fucking pay for water with that. All right.

Right. But you're basically there, like... Yeah. Yeah. But you have to wait until he's done? I don't know, wait until he fucking basically unlocks the car. I don't know if it's, like, fucking gonna be ten minutes from now or it's gonna be fucking three or six hours, I fucking have no idea. And... What? What? What? No, nothing, I mean, yeah, I was gonna say you freaked out on Becky so you can't even ask, like, is it gonna be... Like... Does she have a time frame? Not really, I mean... She doesn't know, she's, like, out hanging out with friends or whatever, and... Yeah. I don't know. And, like, she couldn't give you those guys' numbers?

Well, yeah, but you can't turn the money, so it's, like, either, like, now she's gonna have to, like, Oh my god, dude, this guy is so addicted to this tablet. I'm, like, trying to fucking get it set up for him and he, like, I can't, if you take it for him he can't do anything for you. Oh, and then he hands it back to me but then he's, like, no, I wanna hold it, though. Oh my god. Oh. She just sent me a message saying something, like, he wants to go there first or he wants to meet with Becky first or some shit, I don't even know. I just sent her a message, told her I'm going home. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Were you able to meet up with her? No. I didn't have to. So you've just been sitting in your car all day? Yeah, like, 100%. Oh, so you're gonna be, like, I still wanna meet up with you first? To her? Yeah. Huh. I can't understand you. I said I'll for him to just be, like, I still wanna meet up with you first, like, to her. And you weren't able to get in? No. Can you, baby? Baby, I'm not trying to keep it away from you, I'm trying to help you. Oh my god, I think he's probably, like, wants to freeze. Oh my god. Oh my god, this guy sucks. Oh my god. So, what's your plan? Huh? Oh my god. What's that guy's problem? I'm trying to fucking do the stupid thing that you put on me to put the password on. He wants me to put the password and it, like, locks and it fucking freezes and he's fucking climbing me. Are we? Why are you saying are we? Like, you see me trying to help you. Shout out, Alice. What password? Because it's, downtime is on. Oh, that time? Yes. Yeah, you don't ever put in the password, I just put in the pen. I don't have the pen. Either way, it's fucking, like, lagging and, like, every time he touches it and, like, tries to pull it away from me it, like, fucking does stuff and then I have to fucking start it all over again. I don't know. I'm sorry, I don't know how to spend the day. What? I'm sorry you had a shitty day. It wasn't all that bad. I mean, I got some work done on my on my feets or whatever whatever you call it. Oh, that's good. I wish you went to Phoenix's or whatever and could have at least gotten a little bit. Yeah, she's out. She's out? Yeah. Hmm. Yeah. I mean, I'm going through the Elk River area and probably if I can give what's-his-name a call at Rob and see if he's got, like, a little bit for me. Rob? Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, if you if it's not too much trouble I mean, don't kill yourself over it, but Right, right. Don't prolong your stay. I'm coming! Yeah, I don't know.

Texted me back saying that he's at work and that he'll call me in a few minutes. Rob did? Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. What about heading into Blaine? Well, that's where he lives. I mean, like somewhere, I think Shelly and fucking Travis's mom, Missy, I think they live in Elk River, but he's got his own place out in fucking like Blaine. Right. So, I don't know. I just took a ride while I was going through fucking whatever this godforsaken town is called, Zemarine. Yeah. Hey, kids, don't worry. We're going to be all right. Here we are together. All right. I don't know. I feel like I feel like it was nice when I had like breaks of work and then, you know, I go back to work, but I've only been home for like a week or something. I don't like this. Yeah. Why do you say that? I don't know. It's just boring being stuck at home all day. Yeah. And it's like if I had a car, at least you could like, I don't know, go do something, but don't have that either. Well, trust me, being out in the world and all out here grinding ain't what it's all about. It's not all that great. Yeah. I know, but it's like going to work, like, you know, it's shitty. You have to sit there. Well, I had to sit there for like six hours and like maybe have a few conversations with some people, have some conversations with the fucking people that work around me. But it was a nice break. And then the kids had activities. Now we're just all stuck like fucking Amish people in the house and they're fucking crying and loud and fucking don't talk. And it's like, you gotta be like, yeah, fucking captain adventure with those guys. Yeah. Well, it's cold outside. Yeah. They got fucking snow here for a reason. Yeah. You're not bothering me at all. Yeah, this guy's about to fall asleep. Yeah. No, Alex, he's been real fucking. Atlas doesn't go to bed till kind of late because he actually naps throughout the day. Alex didn't wake up till noon and then he didn't sleep all day. And then just like the last within the last hour, he was getting real fucking whiny, cryy. And then he wanted to lay down. And then I put a movie on for him and then he made me come and lay in here. So I'm laying down in his bed. His eyes are like squinting. They're awake, but surely about to fall asleep. Try like you. What? So you're having to blame on the whim that he might call you or yeah. I don't know what I'm fucking doing. I don't know. I don't know what I'm fucking doing. Like you're basically 30 minutes away from the house. Hello. I'll give you a call. All right. See ya. Bye.",

Yeah, that's too bad. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear that. It's those days. It can be rough. That's for sure. Yeah. Yeah, Annandale, the the one other store that we have left besides just the one where I work at Spring Lake Park but Annandale had a pipe burst in the wall. So, I had to go up there and **** deal with that. Oh, yeah. And get back and had to get the truck working because they were going out of town with it tomorrow morning and didn't have one light was out and one turn signal was out and they were leaving at like 4 o'clock in the morning. So, I had to get that done before I left and the last thing I wanted to do when I got back from Annandale, let me tell you. Yeah. Yeah. But anyway, got it all done now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, what are you up to? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was diving through that area. Yeah. I only stay there a couple nights a week, three, four, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I figured. Yeah. I I was like in the I was in the Rogers area originally like, you know, looking to go grab and. Yeah. And it was just a bunch of like **** I was grabbing from somebody I don't usually grab from and they're like, I don't know. They they got it and then they like went went into work and they had it locked in their car and I'm like, do I just like **** do I go in and get it like what's going on and then I got a check and it's like locked and I'm like, oh my god, dude. This is it. I'm going home. This is crazy. Yeah. Yeah. We'll deal with this uh tomorrow or the next day or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Or or from somebody else. Yeah, I know. Yeah. I mean, I might be, I might be like able to put up with all that sort of stuff. It was like somebody I knew. Like, I don't **** know the person. I was like, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I figured I'd give you. It's kind of all the same but but you know, right? Like I said, if you don't know the person, then it changes things a lot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, how are you been though? It's kind of same old same old or yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Yeah. Uh but the only thing new is last uh spring, I bought a Mustang. Oh, and what's that? You got ready to come to her? The the fusion is um Shelly's driving that. Okay. Yeah. And then um and so this winter, I bought a beater pickup truck, a Ford pickup truck and she's a beater but you know, it starts every day and runs and so that's good. Yeah, that's definitely good. Yeah and my boss let me store the Mustang up at work next to his vet and heated storage underneath his office. That was awesome and for nothing too. Yeah. So, for free too and it's really good. Yeah, it's cool. What what you're what you're Mustang is it? Yeah, it's a 2021. Oh, damn. It's a turbocharged force and I wanted to get a GT so bad but then after looking at him and driving one of those, I was very surprised by it, how fast it was and I thought, you know, **** insurance wise, overall money wise, and fuel mileage, I think I could be happy with the four cylinder turbo, you know, because it's pretty fast and it looks cool. So, so, so I went with that because you know, I could go a lot newer than I planned on, you know, and one of the one thing is it's got a big dent on the side that because it's black, you know, and you kind of, you know, I mean, you notice it but you don't notice it that easily. I mean, I'll probably try to get it fixed but I drove it all summer but it's like right behind the driver's door. So, you can't really just like replace the door, you know, it's **** whole side, you know, not the whole side but you know, it's a pretty good dent in the back, you know, right right between the door and the back wheel. You'll see it this summer. Yeah, the spring, whatever maybe but yeah, but I like it a lot. It's nice. Yeah, it sounds nice. So, you know, you don't got the child support anymore. So, nope, nope, that's done. Yeah, finally, **** ain't. Yeah, I didn't think it was ever going to end. Yeah, man, that sucks. I know that you're **** like really puts a damper on **** things when they're three, 300 bucks a week. Pretty much the whole time I worked at Jerry's until, you know, until a year ago or whatever. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. So, that was nice. What a what a **** huge boost that was. Let me tell you. 1200 bucks a month. Yeah, damn. Yeah. And that's the way that I managed to not even really notice anymore. You know, now that I got more payments and you know, but just you know, but I have more and you know, a little extra expendable cash and **** but but you know, it's not like I'm smart and tucking it away for retirement or anything. You know? Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm **** I'm I'm terrible with money. I just figured if I make enough of it, I don't need to be. I don't need to worry about being good at keeping it. Well, right. I know that's kind of how I look at it too as long as I'm making enough every week to pay my bills and live and eat and you know, I'm I'm doing alright. Yeah. Yeah. No need to be beat myself up. Right. Over stupid expenditures that we do. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Well, that's it. You know, and you kind of in a way, you grow out of that a little bit even, you know, it took me a long time but I mean, I didn't completely grow out of it either. You know, I probably didn't need to buy a Mustang but you know, you deserve that **** dude. You deserve that for sure. That's kind of that's what that's what I thought and that's what Michelle said. Probably because she wanted my car by now. Yeah. Yeah. But you know, it would have been nice to either trade that in or maybe use it as my winner beater but she needed a car. So, you know, no big deal. I can let her have it. Yeah. You know, whatever you use it to have it. I don't know. It's still my name but yeah. So, so, where are you still up in Mora or whatever? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Still out in Mora and then yeah, I just been working a lot lately. Uh you know, I started this new job like a peer. I'm like a peer. Basically, I'm like a **** life coach for people with substance abuse issues. Oh, okay. Yeah. Yeah. You know, we know about them issues. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know. Mainly, I'm like II don't know people like they come into my office and they're like, you know, I need a job. I I need like, you know, I need to get into a place like I need all these. Where do I where do I start? Right. Where do I start kind of thing, huh? Yeah. Yeah. So, I like take all their take all their goals. I break them down into manageable goals and. Yeah. And then I like work with them kind of like a little co-pilot. It's right. I gotta say it's pretty rewarding but like. Yeah. Honestly, this is the **** least amount of money I've ever been paid in my life like. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah. But you know what? You know, one thing is if you if you enjoy it, you know, that that that goes a long way. I'll tell you. Yeah. Definitely. I'm sure there's other things you'd rather do maybe but like make more money but. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the thing is, you know, down the road, maybe it will pay a little more, you know, who knows but or you know, find a different company to work for or whatever. I mean. Yeah, there's always solutions like I think in I think in like March or April, I'm going to be doing some like sales work for a constructing company and that's like six figures. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah. It's an established one and you really gotta made, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, there's those **** roofing guys, those roofing contractors that those sales guys go around and **** make bank. I know. I know they do. I tried that for a little while but I'm not the kind of guy that's really good at that **** you know, going door to door and you know. Yeah. I'm trying to you know, it's not like it's you know, trying to sell something that isn't needed necessarily but it's just general. It's just not me to to do that, you know. Yeah. It didn't last very long. Yeah, you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, in my first year of doing it, I I kind of like bailed on it because I I didn't really know what to expect and I didn't really. Right. Right. You get you get a lot of turndowns but you only need a few of them, you know. Yeah. I finally got it and it's it's nice. It's **** definitely. I could definitely see you doing it more than me though. I mean, it seems more like your kind of thing that rather than, you know, like me, you're a little more outspoken and outgoing, I think. Yeah, I kind of, it's usually pretty awkward in the in the very beginning for me. That's the whole thing. It's a getting used to it too, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's just like, yeah, usually, it's super awkward. The first one or two doors you knock and then it's kind of like, let it go. Yup. Yup. And they're either going to say yes or no for really, you know, when it comes down to it, you know. Yeah. You gotta be able to handle rejection, I guess is what it really comes down to, you know. Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Dude, so Travis is finally out now, huh? Yeah. Yup. Yup. He's he's in you know, intense supervisor. It just released him to to medium, medium security, you know, supervision, whatever. So, he can get out. He can he can leave the premises now but but you know, just for, you know, day trip, you know, lunch or whatever, you know, they gotta know where they wanna know where he's going, what he's doing, who he's with, you know. Oh yeah. How long has he got it got it? I don't know. For sure but I know his mom went and took him out one day. They were gonna go to lunch or something and yeah, he's but that's what he said too is that, you know, of course, that changes as time goes on but he you know, cuz I went and brought her there one time too right before he got released to the medium security or whatever but yeah, he says, yeah, I'm I'm I kinda wanna stay away from, you know, you guys and and my old friends and stuff and you know, it's probably a good idea, you know, I won't take it personal but you know, it's a lot easier to to stay out of trouble if you're not, you know, with the same people that, you know, you know, people that are still doing things and you know, yeah. So, yeah, he's still, you see him and he's got his long hair. Yeah. Yeah. He got a cut now. Oh, okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I brought brought his mom there cuz I was going out to pick up my kid out in Bayport and he's Maplewood, I think it was. Yeah. So, I just dropped her off and picked up my kid and came back and picked her up and I think that was that was actually on what the hell day was it? Um must have been. Oh, it was like the weekend after New Year's or whatever the weekend of New Year's, you know, on the Saturday, New Year's, you know, and but yeah, so she gave him a haircut while she was there and **** Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, what else? I don't know. Not much else new. Kind of the same old same old stuck here at my mom's because I can't abandon her and leave her here **** She can't deal with the house by herself, you know, and yeah and I got such a **** mess here. I gotta **** start getting my ass moving, you know, and because you know, she's going to be ninety-two and it's pretty **** good health though. She'll probably live longer than me. Yeah. Yeah. **** I know what that's like. My I figured we all figured my mom was going to like years and years ago but yeah. Yeah. She's still going. Yeah. She's like **** Mick Jagger, dude. She's like never going to die. Yeah. Yeah. I know. Yeah. Some of those guys are amazing with the lifestyle they lived in the **** still going, you know? Yeah, dude. It's not. How's he how's he just finally kicked? What was he? **** 80 years old, wasn't he? Did he did he die? Did Mick Jagger finally die? He did. Yeah, he did. Just, you know, like a month, 2 months ago, maybe. Oh my god. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. Surprising though that he, you know, nobody ever would have thought that he'd make it that long, you know, not a million years. Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, I'm just, I'm just pulling in now. So, okay. Um yeah, well, yeah, get a hold of me because you know, I'm always looking for a different avenue and whatnot. So, yeah. Yeah, that'd be good. Yeah. So, maybe we can, I don't know, whatever we can meet somewhere or, you know, go have a beer or or, you know, if you go to Elk River a lot or that direction, you know, I can meet you out there or whatever. Something like that. Yeah, all those things sound good, man. I'd love to see you. Alright. Alright, sounds good. Um yeah, get a hold of me. Let me know. Otherwise, I'll bug you when I'm when I need to. Cool. Yeah, that works. Okay. Alright, I'll see you. Alright, sounds good. Talk to you later. Yup. Bye. Bye.",

So I got you on speakerphone, I hope you don't mind, but me and my team lead, we're interested in just having a conversation with you guys and possibly helping us kind of get some things lined up for an event that we have coming up in May. Yeah, let's hear it. Okay, so I kind of explained. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to do a capital campaign campaign for a nonprofit over here at Archangels. We owe $50,000 on our building, and we don't take we don't do any government grants or anything. So basically, everything is just donations. And the reason why we want to do this capital campaign is because we want to free up that money that we pay on mortgage to put back into the community and back into our participants here. Okay. Um, what we have going on right now, recently, a window was busted out here at the building. And we got a new piece of glass. And then I put out there on Facebook, you know, if anybody had an experience, if they would like to come in and donate their time and replace our window for us, blah, blah, blah, blah. Reliant roofing reached out to me, and they came in and they put in a new window for us. And Alex talked to him about, you know, like, our capital campaign, and he was like, well, we don't do monetary donations. But what we do do for organizations is we build playhouses or play sets or this, that or whatever. And so they're building us a playhouse, and we're going to be raffling off a playhouse rate, we're going to sell 1000 tickets for $25 each, and that'll bring us halfway there. And so we decided that we want to put together like a banquet, May 30, and then also raffle off that playhouse at the banquet. At the banquet, we're going to do spaghetti dinner plates for like $10 each, we're going to talk to Faith Feeds, see if they'd be willing to make spaghetti for us. And then we want to do like a silent auction type of thing. And so we're trying to, we're thinking about doing like 20 to 25 different baskets for people to bid on. So these are all these are, this is just like brainstorming that I came up with yesterday. I'm trying to put together like an organizing committee. And then that kind of thing. But I was talking to Brandon, I was like, well, I lost your number. And I'm pretty sure Alex took it off my desk and never did anything with it, to be honest. But right. And so I was talking to Brandon this morning, I was like, remember that guy over at RCN that we talked to when we went to their little seminar over there? And he was like, yeah, I got their number. I was like, okay, well, let's reach out to them, see if they'd be willing to come in and sit down with us and chit chat and see if your organization can do anything to help us make this event the best that it can be. So right off the bat, I can't promise you that Thrivent themselves will be able to do anything, but I myself can. Something I could do is so I have my own investments with Thrivent, right? And so because I have my own investments with them, not because I work for them, I get something that's called like an action team. And so I used it last year, but now that it's a new year, I believe I have another one. And so what that could include is Thrivent would give me $250 to help out with your event. I couldn't, I can't like directly just donate that $250, there's certain tax laws around this obviously, tax and donation laws. But like I can give you an example of what I did for my last one, the Tri-County Humane Society kind of had like a welcoming events to show off their new building because they opened their new building during COVID, but no one kind of came to see it, right? I was able to just use my $250 to buy like eight gallons of hot apple cider and 200 cookies from crumble cookie. So then Humane Society was able to advertise like, Hey, come see our building, maybe donate, we have free apple cider and free cookies, right? So I can promise that right away, I would be interested in using my own action team to help you guys. I can see what Thrivent as a company could do, but I'm not sure on that right now. I can get back to you guys on that by end of the week. But 100% I'm interested and I can, you know, use that $250 again to I could just go get another 200 cookies from crumble or something and bring it to your guys' spaghetti dinner if that works. That would be awesome. Or maybe the $250 could maybe even go towards like the spaghetti or like whatever you guys need. I just can't directly donate the money, right? Right, right. Okay. Yeah. Will you jot down my phone number? Yeah. And then get back to me whenever you have a chance to and I'll also get your number from Brandon and I'll put it on my little spreadsheet also. Yeah. What was your name again? Heidi Austin. Okay. Yeah. That sounds familiar. And then what is your phone number? 320-330-2676. Okay. Sounds good. Yeah, I'll get back to you guys on that by Friday, but definitely include me as a person for sure. I'm in on this. I'll see what Thriving as a company can do, but no promises will not end. Okay, perfect. Thank you very much. Yeah, of course. Anything else? No, that'll do it. Good. I'll get back to you guys by Friday on this. Okay. Sounds good. Thank you. Yep. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hello. Hey, how's it going? Hey, I'm okay. I'm actually fine. I'm kind of teary-eyed because I was just, I just did a Zoom hearing with Nystrom and Associates to get back into the co-occurring program there. So, yeah, I'll be starting their co-occurring again, three days a week outpatient and with my same counselor that I was working with back over a year ago. So, I never got kicked out or nothing. I just like got this check here at fucking for $335 that's sitting right on my, the otter sale one that I thought was going to Luke's. I got it here in the mail. And so it's sitting here and I need to get to the bank like two blocks away from where I live, U.S. Bank. What are you doing? What's up? Was this going to pick you up? All right. So, Red, you know, the guy that I met, he was asking me if I can give him a ride home from the office. Okay. I was going to say I could pick you up now if you're ready. I'm not. So, where's Red live? In town? Yeah, in town. Can you come get me? I'm like, well, unless he's going to hang out or can he hang out or I don't mind if you don't mind, but like, or like, I just want to, I guess I need like 20 minutes. So, if you want to go drop him off first, that would be fine. And then come get me, but just park in the back and call me when you get here. If you're coming right now, I'll put my, if you need to come right now, I'll put my stuff away and then I don't need to, but they've been coming in here and throwing my shit in the garbage brand. And so I'm talking to Luke right now on the phone and his truck is up at the shop. He's in Pelican Rapids. So, but yeah, they get the team, your shoes and stuff and your team, your stuff and my team, your stuff, all my team, your stuff. So I'll shut up. What do you want to do? Do you want to come get me or no, you're going to drop me. Yeah, I can wait a little bit. I can wait a little bit. And then, uh, I, when we leave, when I go to drop him off, I'll pick you up at the same time. And, and, uh, but I was going to ask you, I need to know, like, what, uh, what do you, what's the deal with these clothes? Cause it sounded like that's my stuff. That's my stuff. That's my stuff. Period. I, it was, I'm actually kind of mad at Gabby. So we'll talk about it when you get here. Okay. So, and she knows that I, cause she told me she took stuff that I didn't want her to have and I'm pissed off about it. So, and I, there's nothing I'm going to do about it. It is what it is. And I'm just, I just need to vent a little and tell you what's up. So like she was not to go into that box whatsoever and try shit on and blah, blah, blah, and take that fucking curling iron. That iron in there was for your girls, not for her, or actually I was going to give it to Kendall. So I was going to, that's why it was in that box because I didn't want her to touch it or nobody to touch anything in that fucking box. Those flannels are for period. That's all I want to talk to you about. And, um, I apparently, is there a bag of clothes that she went through that, that she knew I told her three times, Brandon, that that bag was the only thing that was, she was supposed to go through and take a couple of things that she wanted out of there. Why'd you bring it? Why'd you put it all together then? I'm more surprised and shocked by it all. I'm not even mad. And so it just is what it is. I, it is what it is. So no, don't donate the stuff. Don't give stuff away. That is my stuff in there for me, you and your girls, my nieces, period. Okay. So you just want me to drop it off back? That's a good thing. Well, yeah, I know. That's Oh God. I mean, no, I've told Gabby, I told Gabby three times. I talked to her like two all day yesterday and the day before. Yes, I did. No, no, no, no. Slow down. Stop fucking yelling. Slow down. You're yelling. Yesterday and the day before. Yesterday and the day before. Yes, I talked to Gabby all day. Well, I talked to Gabby yesterday is what I'm trying to say. Hey, hey, I didn't say you did it. I didn't say that. You asked me if you could donate it. She doesn't forget shit like that. That's fine. It is what it is, Brandon. I talked to Gabby about it yesterday and today. Yesterday and the day before. Excuse me, yesterday and the day before. Yes, I'm here, but you're yelling at me. I can't hear you. Yes, hello. I'm here. It's like I can hear you, but I can't hear you. What happened? Try it now. Hello. Can you hear me now? Yeah, yeah. Well, maybe my volume was just turned up way too loud. You were really loud a second ago, and then it went really quiet. Now I can see my volume is just messed up. You know what? It's the internet here. It's the internet here. I'm not getting phone calls. I'm not getting text messages. My text messages won't send, but I'm not mad. You know what I mean? But it's not to donate. It's not to donate. That's all I want to tell you. Be okay. And maybe we'll talk more about it when you get here. Some stuff you probably could. I don't know. I thought your girls would like some of those clothes. When you see them, I thought she was coming up here. Last I talked to you or Kiana was about the same time, last November. Right around the same time. She didn't even have her place yet. But that's the last time I ever talked to you or Kiana. And so my inclination is that they're tall. They're growing. They're tall like you and mom. And I think that's the fucking baddest shit ever in the whole world. That's fucking awesome how tall they're getting. I love it. And I think your smiles are beautiful. And I miss them to death. But yeah, there was no like with the iron thing. It was brand new. I wanted to give it to Kendall. And she probably wouldn't even like it anyway. So I find that Gabby has it. Okay. But I told Gabby yesterday and the day before we talked about it, I told her, I was like, that's not for you. I told you the plastic clear bag you could go into and have your way with it or whatever, you know. But I already knew a lot of that stuff wouldn't fit her. That was only some stuff that would because like a lot of it was my stuff that I was going to give to the girls, to my nieces. So it's going to be interesting. It's not a big deal. I don't want to fight about it. It's just, you know, it's not a big deal. And I don't want you to be mad. I have this check here and I want to hang out and fucking have fun. And like not arguable clothing, because we can donate some of that stuff. I don't have a problem with it. We can go back to Savers and I'll buy clothes. We'll donate it all. You can pick out whatever people think, jackets, everything. I'll go over there and donate it. Oh my god damn. I don't know. Goodwill. You want to go to Goodwill, Brandon? No, I don't want to go to any of those places. I just want, like, if you're going to donate something, just tell me what it is you want to donate. Okay, I'll let you know. But as of right now, nothing. Okay, that's fine. I just wanted to double check. Come get me. Where are you? Where are you? I just got to the office. You said you had like 20 minutes or something? No, just till you get here. I just need to throw some makeup on and probably put some jeans on. Okay. So, yeah, I mean, on your way over here, I can be ready by the time you get here. Okay. All right. Yeah, give me like probably 10 or 15. Yeah, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you, Brandon. Please don't be mad. You're fine. I'm sorry. Just take a deep breath, please. I love you. I'll see you soon. All right. Okay, bye. All right. Bye.",

    "transcript": "Hey, Brandon. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. Just waiting outside while a client goes in and gets his groceries. Okay. Sounds good. Do you want to speak now or should we do it later? Yeah, we're good. We can talk now. Okay. So yeah, so as far as Cassandra goes, have you heard from her at all lately? Yeah, I talked to her the other day, probably close to a week ago now. Okay. I talked to her because we were looking for Zach or something like that, and then we ended up finding him. And while I was on the phone with her, I asked her if she's had a chance to meet with Bella, and she said that she hasn't. Okay. And an update on that, and I guess that's probably a reflection of how long it's been since we've talked or discussed this, that Bella no longer works with our company, number one. And number two, that there had been a different peer, Sativa, who was assigned to her, and that I have given the number to Sativa as well, like I think as of Monday. And when I saw her on Tuesday, they hadn't talked, but when I texted her this morning to inquire about that follow-up, I wanted to also touch base and point to, I guess, to also ask, again, just ask her, like, what she's up to or how she's doing, based on that. I want our new two stones to be, you know, two birds with one stone with both her and Zach, right? Like, we have two peers that are willing and able and need the hours and clients on their caseload, you know, as well as just knowing that they were like, you know, two of your, I guess, lack of a better term, main clients, and or that they, you know, could and should continue to receive the help. So, you know, continue to persevere and, you know, continue to try to make these things happen. And I know that, you know, again, that's, you know, there's context to everything in that, you know, you had been good about staying on top of that for this, but then, you know, your day-to-day has been rightfully so, you know, your energy directed towards St. Cloud. And, you know, I wanted to give you a, you know, an affirmation on that, you know, because I know that you're doing what's both asked from you in a figurative sense, but you're also doing it in a literal sense, you know, and that your hours also reflect that. So, like, you're doing a really good job and, you know, I want you to know that. Thank you. Thank you. That does mean a lot. Yeah, I appreciate that. And I also wanted to say thank you for, you know, I know that my name has come up in a couple of meetings recently, just how I'm doing and yeah, I just want to say thank you for all the support you guys have given me. And I don't know, I truly do know that you can be successful here, especially with your guys' help and you guys have done a lot to do that. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, absolutely. Well, good. I'm glad because, you know, staying on the same page, you know, holistically, you know, like mentally, emotionally, physically, financially, etc. You know, is important, like with your job, your co-workers, you know, feeling appreciated, feeling respected, feeling supported, you know, seeing potential, right? And then also, you know, reinvesting in each other and in ourselves, you know, to continue that good work that we all do. So, you know, yeah, just as far as, you know, that goes, I wanted to make sure these people didn't fall between the cracks, you know, as well as to try to like, again, just, you know, do the right thing and see it through for every client that we can, you know. There's a whole lot of clients in the system that I've never met or don't know or don't know where they're at or how they're doing. So it's like with the people that were, you know, special or important to, you know, one of our peers, then that puts like a name and a face to it, right? So I have a little bit more of an investment, you know, again, like being transparent, we have to help train these peers on and it makes sense based on their, you know, location and availability to make this happen because it'd be like a win-win for everybody, you know? Right. Yeah, yeah. I was actually, but I was going to say with Will, so Will Nutt and Zach, like I did kind of like the same thing I did with Bella and Cassie. Yeah, like a three-way call. And I also gave Will like a pretty comprehensive like summer, like a report. Background, yeah, update. Yeah, yeah. That kind of like shared with them like, okay, this is like his, this is like a picture of his driver's license in case he loses it. This is like a picture of his, I don't know, just everything that I've. Yeah, yup. And wow, that's really proactive of you because I mean, yeah, good, good for you, man. That's really, that's really awesome. I've seen a couple things lately from different peers that are like, oh, wow, that's smart. I should probably include that, you know, obviously like, yeah. And that's where it's at, you know, like we help each other. We learn, you know, we learn from each other. So I want you to know that goes both ways, you know? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, yeah, you're welcome. And, you know, like, yeah, as far as he goes, and as far as Will goes, right, like I was, they, they both have probably, that situation has the greatest question mark, obviously kind of attached to it, you know, like, um, being a quote unquote problem client. Zach has, or, you know, like somebody with numerous issues or, you know, areas of concern, like he, let's just say starting with communication, right, with being consistent with it, you know, that can be an impediment or an uphill battle for anybody. But, you know, with the newer peers that, you know, like, it almost has to, like, connect for it to really lock in, you know, for someone to go above and beyond for the person, right? Part of it is him being receptive to the help. Another part is like, I don't know, you know, I have, I have faith in Will's ability, you know, to do the job and, and to help him and to, you know, get along with him. I, yeah, if that makes sense. I can, I can easily see based on the performance or interactions I've had with her or heard back from clients that Sativa is very, you know, easy to get along with, you know, and I, and I foresee her and Cassie actually having like a very beneficial relationship, you know, they're both about the same age, um, you know, they're both women, right? Like, uh, and, you know, I feel whatever, but anyway, besides all that, how, how are you doing and, or how things been for you this week? Um, I'm doing, I'm doing pretty good. Um, I, I, um, uh, was with my therapist yesterday and I basically, uh, yesterday was just full of like appointments. So I didn't actually didn't, wasn't able to put any hours on, but it was kind of a bummer, but today I should be kind of putting in extra hours to make up for it a little bit. And, um, one of the things I talked with my therapist about was that, um, uh, we're working on like some SMART goals. She's basically like kind of my, I don't know, she's legally my therapist, but she's like, you know, she's, uh, kind of, we kind of share a lot of information lately about like her, how she reports, like in a, like what software she uses, like what. Like my issue I was having with late reporting and, um, and, uh, so that's like a SMART goal I'm working on. And I, I think that, um, it's like kind of handling it the same way I do with my recovery one day at a time. Yeah. Yep. Definitely. I mean, you know, we, we can only do the best that we can. Right. Um, and that also comes with like doing the best with acceptance, you know, and or grace, um, you know, like making ourselves feel bad about a lack of something isn't productive. You know, obviously it's the opposite. It's harmful. Um, you know, like I kind of mentioned before, like, you know, if the only, if everything else is perfect and all you have to worry about is late charts, you know, then I can see that locking in. But like, you know, life happens, man. It's, it's the winter, it's freezing cold, you know, like, I don't know, I don't know about you, but I've been dealing with like sickness with myself for multiple weeks, you know, like my kids been sick off and on, you know, um, I don't know, like things happen, but, you know, finding out why you're, you know, not able to chart would be like, you know, something that I would do in time. So self-reflection, you know, like for me, I had to create like a non-negotiable, which is like, if I haven't done them by nine o'clock, then by nine o'clock, you know, like my computer is going to be turned on, you know, even if I'm like making my dinner at that moment and, you know, like I, that's what I got to do, you know, like for me, that's when I would put my kid down, you know, when I was living with her, you know, now I only watch her in the morning time. Until like three. So I don't. But I'm trying to say that, like, I understand that, you know, maybe your kids are older and so they'll go to bed later, but then I would again, like set an alarm for 10 PM, you know, like no matter what you're going to wake up, even if you're groggy, you're going to wake up when your phone starts going off as an alarm. Like, and you just know that you've got to, you know what I mean? Do it like I don't want to send you off by saying that I at least get it started, but at the very minimum, open it up and get it started. Like, if you were to, like, have a bare bones note that you then you went and finished in the morning, like, I would much rather see that because then it looks like you're trying and or there's something there that's, you know, attached to it. Does that make sense? Absolutely. Yeah. I'm trying to do that thing where, you know, maybe I like I could cheat a little and if I like create the note like before midnight and then like finish it later. Let me clarify. There is no cheating. Like, you can't just create the blank document. Right. Right. Yeah. I found out that that doesn't work like that. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, like I said, like, if you were to, let's just say, for example, title it, skip the location box, you know, make sure you got the progress note and then like half of a client response, that would be, you know, what I consider like bare bones sufficient for like, you know, that would buy you the 12 hours to fix it. Right. Like, no matter what, by noon the next day, the expectation would be to get your shit done. Right. Because, okay, I get it. You had a long night. But what are you doing when you wake up in the morning? You know, and that's like rhetorical as well as, you know, literal. So, you know, again, like, I'm willing to give all the grace in the world as long as it's, there's like the effort being put forth, you know, like, so, you know, and again, like, moving forward, it's not just about me or what I think is right. You know, like, there have been some successes with that and there have been some failures with that, like, as far as like the company goes and or that with Lacey as the program manager, there's a lot more on hands oversight, you know, to where it's like, my hands are tied in certain situations. So, you know, again, like, I'm, you know, giving you what I'm looking for, as well as like, how it's going to be, I guess, like, dealt with moving forward, right? Like, even if it's like the other thing, now that I mentioned it, that, you know, I'm supposed to talk to you about is the edit shift request and or why there was like, a whole handful, more than a handful of them last week. Let me, let me look at the picture. Yeah, there was definitely a bunch of them 26 and 25. Yeah. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Yeah, yeah, I know. I know why there was, I could give you an explanation. Okay. Yeah. No, 25th and 26th is Sunday and Monday. Sunday and Monday. Yeah, that's what it says edited shift on January 26. It says that. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Sorry, I didn't realize I switched conversations. I was referring to the edit shift requests on connecting. Right. Yeah, that's what I was talking about. Okay. Okay. All right. Go ahead. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, on. So. I'm pulling it. I'm pulling up my. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I'm pulling it. I'm pulling up my. So. On the. So the 29. So, wait, that's not right. All right. So the 20. All right. So, Monday. Monday was good. But there was, but that's not what we're talking about. We're not talking about Monday. We're talking about Friday and Thursday. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, Brandon. I'm sorry. I'm, I'm, I'm pulling up to my mom's house and I got to get my kid and then I got to go drop her off. So I got. No, you just call me when you're not with your client anymore. Okay. All right. Sounds good. Okay. All right. I'll talk to you later. Yeah.",

    "transcript": "Hey, can you hear me? Yeah, I can hear you. Hey, okay. So, man, that that RV gone, bro. Oh, it's it's gone. What do you mean? They told me they told me I shouldn't have never drove it without that belt that I might have **** up the heads on there. Really? Is that a possibility? Yeah, that's what I had mentioned before. Yeah. But but what you said this last time that about it being just a water pump like what? No, it's not the water pump. It was the AC compressor. Oh. So, it's not the water pump but man, you know what I was feeling like though since it was so damn cold outside, I don't see how I could have damaged anything because there's no light come on or nothing. Yeah. But that don't mean **** though anywhere, I guess. So, okay, so, 2012 Nissan Quest, are those any good? Uh 2012 Nissan Quest. Yeah, for $7000 and it's got 136 thousand miles on it. It's clean as **** though. hundred and thirty-six. Yeah. It's got 136 thousand 375 is not enough. What's they trying to get rid of it for? 7000 out the door. Oh. I'm all **** clean though. Looks looks like a **** a solid price for Yeah, if it would have been, if it would have been cheaper than that, then I would have been suspicious. 7000 is **** it's a good price in. Yeah. If you're cheaper than you'd probably be paying for somebody's problem and you and that wouldn't be telling you about it, you know, right? And it's super clean too. So, I could probably get like another 100 thousand miles or two out of there. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Nissan's any pretty good vehicles. Yeah. Yeah, they're yeah, they're alright. Like they're kind of sister vehicles to Hondas and Hondas last forever but you know, you know, oil change, keep it clean. Don't let your brother-in-law drive it. Yeah. Hey, man. Hey, I hope you always answer the phone, man. I've been trying to get in touch with you but you wasn't answering the phone. So, this one, uh what what can I do? I got it. Guess what? It's motherfuckers in 3 hours away in Des Moines, Iowa, man. You are? No, that's where the **** vehicle is that I want to go. In Des Moines, Iowa. That's a long **** drive. 3 hours. Yeah. Yeah. How are you? How are you going to get out there? You got like a family member bringing you or something? No, I ain't got no goddamn buddy, man. And my mother **** sons and them is weird as **** and I got that big **** comedy tour coming up starting in February. So, I definitely gotta and then guess what? I gotta drive. That's why I'm saying it's got six thousand miles on it already and I gotta take and drive from **** uh Minneapolis all the way from to on the thirteenth, I gotta be on Indianapolis, fourteenth, I gotta be in Cincinnati, Columbus on the fifteenth, then Philadelphia on the twentieth, twenty-first, Hampton, Virginia, then New York on the but see all those is all on the East Coast area. I'm going traveling straight down that way. So, I can't, you know what I'm saying? I'm not really going too bad on that but I was wondering, I get a car with them kind of miles on there. **** I'm going to hit two or 300 on that **** by the time I get back because I gotta go all the way from Louisville, Kentucky, all the way to Vegas Okay. Yeah. That **** finna have miles bro. So, there is a there is some concerns that common problems with that make and model and around that year like many miles and I don't know if you have like one of the those OBD scan tools or whatever. No, I ain't got one Well, so I guess the the timing chain is like a the kind of a big concern with these things and they're not like if you they're not oiled like every every 30000 miles like if the fluid isn't exchanged every 30000 miles then it can be like they can like slip and then they can fail and like and that's like kind of like equivalent to like having to redo like a like a head gas because you gotta tear like you gotta get down to like the **** like the heads where like you gotta take the whole top of the engine off is what I'm saying, I guess. Yeah. Which. Okay. That can be that can be bad. So, when you when you ask them, when you talk to them, be like, has this engine been as a timing chain been replaced? No, I think what I'm going to do, I'm going to just look for something in Minnesota. So, if some **** pop up, I'll go back to them. You know, I got a guy. He's he's actually, he's the best **** guy to buy purchase from in the entire state of Minnesota. Hands down. Oh, you do? Yeah, I started to ask you that. Where is that set? Uh he's his office is in Ramsey, Minnesota. His name is Antoine. Can you get this website for me? So, I can see what they got. Yup. Yup. Let me pull it up and he's texting to me. Yeah, I'll text him. Yeah, I did say that sometimes he like doesn't have it up to date and like because he goes to the auctions. He's just like, he's just like you and me. He's not like a big time **** but he's super successful like as far as like you know, a guy with a with a dealer's license because he goes to auctions and he purchases these vehicles for at like, you know, dealer price and then he turns around and he sells them and like he he got me like a **** awesome deal. He got me my truck for like probably that truck I've seen you in. Yeah, yeah. I've met you in. Yeah, he's the one that sold me that and I've. So, how many miles you got on your truck though? What is that? A suburban? Yeah, mine's got 290 miles, 290 thousand miles on it. How many was on there when you got it? 164. Okay. And so he sold it to you real cheap. Yeah, he sold it to me. I think I I paid for that thing for and and like you and with the amount of miles on there like he could have, he could have easily charged. Oh, what about your ass? Come and pick me up and take me over there. Some **** I'll pay. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we can talk about it. I I mean, I'm working right now at my first job. Okay. If you I can give you a call back as soon as I can do it is probably tomorrow after work. So, you're saying basically I'll take that **** suburban and I work that other **** you know. No, you should you should call you should call him this guy this number. I'm going to give you his name. Okay. Text it to me. Text it to me and I'll call him. Okay. And tell him I sent you. Man and then what is your name? I I got you on the white boy. That's your name, right? I got you. I know. I got you under as Autozone Van guy. Yeah. See, that's some **** Ricky, my name, man. Ricky.

Is there any way possible, man, when that damn place close, that way they won't know that we out there putting another part in the vehicle? You know what I'm saying? I don't owe them nothing, but what I want to do is, because my people told me that by the weather being as cold as it is, he said it's a possibility that the car can still run. So we got to change that part, you know, the air compressor. Is there any way possible I can pay you to come do that, man? Like, you know, like after five o'clock or some shit like that? Yeah, absolutely. We could do it on a lot, man. I'll take care of you, man. Yeah. We would have to take that part down to AutoZone to get another one, or we can go to one that's close by there. Either way, I got a warranty for the thing. All I need you to do is put it on for me, take it out and put it back in and put the belt on. That's all we need to do. But do you ever, do you ever talk to your guy? He said he was going to call me back with a little black dude. He never called me back though. But anyway, man, he yeah, I called it. He called. He answered. The VIN number? Yeah. If you have a VIN number, I can tell you too. The VIN number to my car? Yeah. Yeah. Just so I can tell you what kind of car it is so I can like know how, like, so I get the instructions basically. I look it up. I got the instructions right now. I got the thing for you. You're talking about that, uh, what the, the, the belt part look like? Um, well, yeah, I want to make sure that I'm getting the right parts and I can call around. Oh, I can give you the license plate number. Yeah. The license plate's good too. Yeah. All right, cool. And, uh, if you give him that phone number, my phone number, and it'll pull up exactly what I ordered. Oh, and it's like the, at the one on Broadway? Yeah. That's true. So you want me to do it like that? Are you talking about at AutoZone on Broadway? Yeah. Well, I mean, I, if I was you, I wouldn't buy the part from AutoZone, like if you can get it. I already bought it from them. I got a warranty on it. Oh, the AC compressor? Yeah. And the belt? The AC compressor. And the belt. Oh, man. How much does that cost? Oh, and, yeah, and then the watcher name will need to be changed too. That one thing. That's the, uh, detention pulley. I got a warranty on that. We might as well get a brand new of that too. Oh, okay. I don't have no problem paying you, man. I just need you to help me get that bitch off that, off that, off that, uh, lot, man. Okay. And if I can drive it long enough to do this tour, I'll be okay. And then I'll throw you something extra when I get back. Because if I get a car to the insurance company, I'm still not going to be able to find nothing in time for me to go do the tour. You see what I'm saying? Yeah. So I might as well try to drive that, man. I don't think that engine is fucked up, man. That was a strong ass engine. I mean, did they say how much they were going to give you for an insurance claim? Well, yeah, but it's not, it's not enough for me to get another RV though. Yeah. I see.

Alex has school tomorrow, I have to remember, cause I fucking missed it on Tuesday. Yeah, it's school. Yeah, he has school. He still has school, you know. Right, I didn't even call him. And then the bus driver's supposed to drop him off tomorrow, like here obviously. She texted me on Tuesday and I was like, like about where exactly she should be dropping him off and then we picked a location like in the parking lot and then she's like, yeah, I'll be there around 2.40, 2.45 and I was like, okay, well we'll see you Thursday cause Alex isn't even there, this was on Tuesday and she was like, oh, thanks for letting me know, like I didn't know. She's like, we'll see you then, so. Gotcha. Yeah, so hopefully he tries to fall asleep in the next hour or two so he gets some sleep and isn't all crabby tomorrow.

Yeah, no, I pulled up, I found like some driveway or some street to pull down. I pulled up on some street so I could fucking like tie something down that's making a fucking bunch of nasty noise. What? Like on the car or because of that thing on top? Well, because there's like there's two like loops on the, there's like two loops on the front side of this fucking thing. And I don't know what really the fucking point of having them is, but yeah, they're fucking making a bunch of fucking nasty noise when I drive.

Yeah, no, it's still there. So what's your plan with that thing? Why do I have to repeat myself? I already told you that. You're going to go ice fishing? What else do you think I'm going to fucking do with it? Yeah, do you hear that at all? Oh, no. What if I know where to do? Yeah, it sounds like a plane is about to take off. Yeah. That's annoying.

Annoyed. Yeah. She's really annoying. What? What? Why? I'm sure that she was probably normal at some point, but like... If I can give her a little drugs, then she like... Turns into a fucking annoying fucking ass. Right. Why would you even give her any? I don't know. Maybe I shouldn't have. I don't think you should have. Oh, thank you. Thank you for your fucking... Cool. What? What the fuck is wrong with you guys? That's what I just fucking said, you dummy. All right, well then I'm just reiterating what you said. Why do you gotta get so mad? It's so easy for me to like... It's fine. It's fine. I also think you're a dumbass too, so... I didn't say that you were. Why do you take everything I say so seriously? Why are you... Why do I take you so seriously at all? Yeah, you're right. That's a good point. See? Why are you so mad right now? All I said is I don't think you should have. Yeah. Well, I forgot the part where... I'm selling your car for crack now. Good luck finding me on eBay. Yeah. God, you're so annoying. If you had your own car, you would've. What is the noise? Yeah, dude. I fucking... You're irritating the fuck out of me. Well, that's what you get for trying to bring home a nice house. Now you gotta deal with the loud-ass noise. It's actually a pretty nice ice house, though, I gotta say. Yeah? Yeah. Why is he even giving it to you? I don't know. His dumbass... I don't know why... I wouldn't want to call him a dumbass, but... That dumbass gave it to me months... Probably a year and a half ago. I think he was banking on me never coming and getting it. Yeah. Actually, I gotta text Tyler. I'm gonna fucking send him a picture. Tyler. Zach. I mean... Oh, I was gonna say, I was like, who? Yeah, I was gonna say, you should, like, leave it at Zach's, because I feel like the only place we can really use it... Like, I mean, obviously we could go to any lake to use it, but he has fishing rods that we can actually use. Obviously, bro. Yes, yes. I gotcha. I mean, I just probably... Probably what I would've done anyways. Thank you for thinking of me. Thinking for me. I don't know what I would do without you. Oh my god. No, actually, what I do need to do, I'm gonna have to bring it into the middle area, and I want to spray it with that fucking... That fucking... That spray seal stuff that you put on shoes. What? Do you... Okay. There's some on the fridge. Why would you spray it with that stuff? Isn't that stuff, like, probably already, like, the material already like that? Like, it's not a material that... No, it's like a fucking material that you'd see, like, made out of, like... It's like canvas. It's canvas? Yeah, like the... You'll see. But it's an ice house. Yeah, it's an ice house. Yeah, so, like, as long as it is, basically, and as wide as it is, and it stands up, and it's probably about, like, I don't know, seven feet tall. Right? Because... Huh? It stands up, and it's about seven feet tall. But it's like, I don't know. You could probably put, like... I don't know. Probably, I'm not... Well, I don't want to say, like, the size of a bathroom, but... Like a porta potty? It's about the size of, like, the fucking utility closet. Alex, what the hell? Stop! What the fuck is wrong with you? Dude, I don't know what's wrong with this guy. Stop! Touching him. He, like, pushed little baby, and then he just started, like, stomping him out. Stop it. Get away from him. And then little baby keeps fucking trying to go on the fucking oven. Yeah. Yeah. Size of the utility closet. Like, the one inside the house, or the one in the middle area? No, like the... No, like the one across from our room. Yeah. Okay. I mean, probably a little wider, but, yeah, it's about that size. Okay. And it's made out of canvas. It's made... It's got, like... No, it's got two wood sides. Like, the end that has the door on it, and the end that's, like, on the back wall is wood. Wood. Yeah, and the bottom is wood, too. Okay. But the rest of it looks like an Oregon trail sort of thing. Yeah, I'm gonna look forward to fucking taking the boys ice fishing. Your what? I'm looking forward to taking the boys ice fishing. Right. Should we do that, like, this weekend? Yeah, definitely. Looks like I got all the stuff for it now. Right. I even got an auger. Is it that heater that we have? Well, no, that's a heater, but an auger is the thing that cuts through the ice. Oh. Oh, is that what he needed, Zach? Yeah. Well, he... Yeah, he said that he needed one, but then he ended up buying one. This is, like, a brand new, like, nice one. Yeah. Oh. Hey, I need you to... Could you do my tap notes for me? I already got them all ready. Yeah, I guess you do it on the phone with me so I can ask you. Any questions that you don't need to ask me? Yes. Did you have a lot of appointments today? What? Did you have a lot of appointments today? I had three appointments. Oh, that's easy. And I already created them on there, so... And, like, put in the time. So, basically, all you need to do is copy and paste the DAP notes and put the titles on them. Right. Did you send it to me? Like, email it to me, the notes? Hold on. Hold on. I just see one here today. Oh, yeah, maybe I did just do one. Hold on. But you haven't done it, done it. Like, you didn't do Dakota's. Just calm down. Calm down. You'll see it in the email. Like, everything... Everything that you're going to need to do will be in this email I'm about to send. Okay. Okay. Let's see. I'll just put it right into an email. What's the date today? 1-28. Yeah. Okay. What was the thing that you said before? Like, you can only bill people four hours a week or a day? I am. Hold on. All right. All right. So I'm going to make... I'm just going to make you do that part. So... All right. So I'm about to send this shit, right? Okay. Okay, so I just sent it to you. Now it's going to look like shit. But what... Are you listening to me? Yeah. What you need to do is go, like, copy it and open up a Google Doc. And when you open... After the Google Docs open, like a blank one, right-click and then click the thing that says copy as markdown. Or paste as markdown. Um... I can't right-click on my computer. Yeah, you can. No, I can't. It's a double-tap. You want me to look it up about if I can right-click on your computer? Or is there a way to do it? Yeah, I mean, I know how to copy. Like, there's a way to copy stuff, but... Like, when you normally right-click, like, on a mouse or something, and a list pops up? That doesn't happen. What is that? Considered a MacBook? Yeah, using two fingers on the trackpad, holding the control key while clicking... Okay. You said paste... Paste as markdown. That's not an option. It just says paste, paste without formatting, format options, clear formatting. We typed format options, I guess. Paste as format options. Select all matching text. Uh, wait, okay. Change key insert link, suggest paste without... yeah. What? Can't I just paste it? Do you have the fucking Google guy in the top right corner? No, but why do I need to paste it in this certain way? What's the difference? You'll be able to look at it, like, it's gonna make... it's not gonna look so fucking, like, messy. I don't know what it looks like looking at on your thing. I mean, yeah, I guess, but I can just read it, I don't know, instead of wasting time trying to figure out how to fucking make it clear. I mean, basically, if you got the fucking GemII symbol in your top right corner of your Google Docs, like, you can copy and paste all of it into his little chat thing and tell him to just paste it as Markdown. It's making me get a membership. It's at Google. Check. How do I... best of Google AI in one membership. How do I just fucking try for free? Sign into your Google. I'm in my Google. What do you mean? Yeah, when I try to fucking... I'll just take your word for it. If you can read it, then that's fine. Here's... Wednesday shift overview total 730... what? Oh, that's, like, for all of your shifts? I was like, how are you with someone for 7 hours and 39 minutes? Right. Okay, Anthony... Okay, so... add... So, co-op time... today... timeframe... I think I need this bigger, if anything. I don't know why it's so small. That feels better. Okay. Alex, why are you so annoying? So, from 9.38... 9.38... duration... 1 hour and 26 minutes... Client, Anthony... Okay. Confirmed... What? What? Why is it... There we go. I was like, why the fuck is it being like that? 9.38... 1 hour and 26 minutes... Anthony... Confirmed... Save... Time add... Generation file... Show all... Okay... Okay... Maybe... PCRS... no, CPRS... why did I... CPRS... Services... 1.28... Okay... Oh... location of meeting... Save... Save... Command C... Fucking... I only got a little bit of set, by the way. And, no matter how much it is, like, it better last me longer than fucking one night. You fucking crackhead. You would. Make it last longer than one night? Because I'm not a fucking drug addict. I don't need a lot. What did I say about saying that? I don't know why you, like, said it so seriously. Alright, big bear. Calm down. You're so easily rage-baitable. You want me to get your mom on the phone? She'll fucking... she'll straighten this right out. I'll fucking do the... I'll do the same thing I do if anybody fucking tells them I bought them lunch, dude. I'll be like, I did what? Like... So, who is saying I did what now? I don't even know that person. I guess I'm just gonna have to show you the video, because it's way funnier. Like, I would never... that's you, whenever someone is trying to tell on you, and you're like, I'm Brandon Gillis, but I would never do that. So I don't know what they're talking about. Wow. Yeah! Arby's. No, no, no, no. Okay, so what is it for? Tell me that. For Anthony Bruner. Contact information for pending application the client believes is approved. For, like, a treatment place? Oh, yeah. A, B properties. Oh, A, B properties. Yeah, A slash B properties. That's how I should write it? A slash B properties? Yeah. For A slash B... A, B's... Yeah, you can put that in quotations, too, so that they don't think I'm being... So, for, quote, A slash B properties? Yeah. End quote? Yes. Assisted the client in procuring contact information for A, B properties to follow up on a pending application the client believes is approved. Okay. So that is housing or assistance, assisting with whatever, non-clinical recovery, advocacy? Yeah, all those things. And clients... The only thing it's not is, fucking, I didn't take the guy to a meeting, so you can't put, fucking, things of recovery, fucking blah, blah, blah. Right. Well, and I feel like client education, you didn't teach him anything. I don't know what client education is that, like, when you're, like, me and client talked about, like, different boundaries and fucking coping mechanisms that the client can use. Like, I feel like that would be client education, wouldn't it be? I don't know, if I was, like, filling out a job application and it's safe to say that he didn't know how to do some portion of that before I helped him. I guess that is. Okay, the client is demonstrating an increased commitment to the administrative side of his recovery by utilizing the office as a professional home base for vocational objectives. His focus on the A, B's, that says Abby's again, but A, B's, A, B properties application indicates proactive self-advocacy and a readiness to transition into stable employment. A, B properties application indicates. Are you watching that? What? Are you watching that on your fucking, like, tablet or something? I don't know what you're talking about. What? I don't even know what you're talking about. 12-15-86, okay, sign. Okay. Alright. I'm done with that one. Um, next. Um, next. Oh, one. Oh, six. The mask everyone loves, the icon printed on a billion posters and t-shirts, was never meant for two in common. It was stolen from someone else's, too. And the evidence was always there. We just didn't have the technology to see it until now. The icon that fooled the world. Next. Next. Um. Dr. Tanaka, watch your. We just didn't have the technology to see it until now. The icon that fooled the world. Why do you watch the most boring stuff? Yes. Wonderful things. The middle coffin is heavily inlaid in glass. Completely unlike the others, which are basically pure gold. Inside was a treasure hoard beyond imagination. Golden chariots, jeweled thrones, painted statues frozen mid-stride. But buried deep within three nested coffins lay the one object that would captivate humanity forever. The golden death mask. Think about this for a second. This thing weighs more than a bowling ball. 22 pounds of solid gold, inlaid with lapis lazuli and turquoise. With eyes of obsidian and quartz that seem to follow you across the room. The ancient Egyptians believed gold was the literal flesh of the gods. This mask wasn't a decoration. It was sacred technology designed to help the pharaoh's soul recognize its own body in the afterlife. Without it, his spirit would wander lost for eternity. On the back, they carved a spell from the book of the dead. Divine protection for the journey into darkness. For a century, the gold accepted this mask as the ultimate masterpiece of ancient Egypt. Flawless. Perfect. Note specifically that Henry King died at 19. But almost immediately, experts started noticing things they had never known. And the crazy part? The clues they would never hear. They were staring at us in the face the entire time. We just refused to sit down. Because if the clues were real, it meant everything we knew about this mask was false. It was a possibility. Here's what doesn't make sense. King Tut died suddenly. Probably from an infection after shattering his leg. Egyptian religious law was absolute. A pharaoh had to be mummified and buried in exactly 70 days. Not 71. Not 69. 70. Now, think about what that means. 70 days to carve an entire world into a single solid life cycle. 70 days to wield three elaborate claws that boast inside each other like fiction dolls. 70 days to gather thousands of burial artifacts. And 70 days to create a 22-pound solid gold mask with microscopic details, precious stone inlays, and hand-carved hieroglyphic spells. From scratch. For a death nobody saw coming. It's not that simple, though. The tomb itself screams rush job. It's tiny. Embarrassingly small compared to other pharaohs' tombs. Some of the wall paintings look unfinished, like the artists dropped their brushes and ran. The massive stone sarcophagus is chipped on the corners, as if panicked workers had to smash pieces off just to cram it in. And get this. When researchers examined the other treasures, many of them weren't made for Tut at all. Statues with faces that looked nothing like him. Jewelry designed for a woman's body. Coffins with names that had been hastily scraped off and re-carved. Then they looked at the mask again. Really looked. The ears were pierced. In ancient Egypt, that was a massive problem. Only children and women wore earrings. An adult male pharaoh on his sacred burial mask would never, under any circumstances, be depicted with pierced ears. The lobes of the ears, each shaped differently, are pierced for earrings. It violated everything they believed about kingship and the afterlife. Some researchers also noticed the face looked off. Too delicate. Almost feminine. And the gold on the face had a slightly different color than the rest of the headdress. A subtle reddish tint that shouldn't be there. If everything was cast at the same time. A terrifying theory began to form. What if, when Tut died unexpectedly, there was no mask ready? What if the priests racing the sacred 70-day deadline grabbed a mask from someone else's tomb, altered it just enough to pass, and stuck it on the boy king's mummy? That raised one question that would haunt Egyptology for decades. Whose face was the mask originally made for? The answer was obvious. Two obvious. You took Dakota all the way to Carlos? Yeah. The vanishing woman. Her name was Nefertiti. You've seen her face. That famous painted bust of the Lord. Where? I know it's fine. She was Tut's stepmother. There was an address on there. What? There was an address on there. Some scholars have begun to suggest that actually this may not belong to him at all. It may not have originally been made for Tut. I don't know. I don't know whose address that was. Then she vanished. Completely. Her experience never been found. Her mummy was never found. Would you fuckin' just do the note, please? Right, yeah. I have to go on a trip. Actually, I have to talk to Dakota and Edith Nefertiti, you know, like, three minutes ago. Okay. Okay. Bye. Let me know when they're done. No, I'm working on his right now.

Like, I am like flying back down to Rochester because I came back to bring Corey home and Ella, the school called and said that she fainted in class. And then I was having my friend go pick her up since it was going to be a minute before I like get back in the area. Cause like I can't fucking an hour and a half away. And they said now that they're calling an ambulance because she's like not very responsive and they just want to make sure everything's okay. Like they said, they're like erring on the side of passion or whatever. But I'm like going back down to go do, I don't know.

What do you think it's related to? Like her not eating or something or? I don't know. I think that she could be low on iron but I think I'm like slightly concerned like she fucking like smoked weed in the bathroom or something and it's like laced with something, you know? Right. That's what I was like. Either it's something that you know or that like it's drugging her. Yeah. I just don't really fucking know. But let me give you a call back though.

Akalo is on her way there. I don't know. I know she has therapy at one so she isn't probably going to be able to ride with Ella, but they said that they're going to if she can't that they're going to send Ella's counselor with her so that she's not going there alone. Yeah, yeah, but I'm I'm on my way back with Cory. He came back with me since I'm all freaking out here. That's nice. No, I weirdly wanted to be like that so that we could use this as a teaching moment, but I didn't want it to be something so bad like, you know, like fentanyl or something. Yeah, I know. So I don't think it was because if it was fucking fentanyl, she would have fucking like passed out right away. Like it wouldn't be 40 minutes later. Right, right. But it's just fucking I've been telling this like somebody died here in Rochester from taking one hit of weed laced with fentanyl like they don't fucking get how serious it is. Right. Well, see, and it's like it's not even the weed. I just fucking if something happened to them over some stupid shit like that, like I would fucking die. Right, right. Oh my god. I'm fucking freaking out. I need to fucking calm down. Maybe you should hit your weed pen. My fucking weed pen is empty, bro. Otherwise I would be right now. Like a mother. No, that's not true. I'd get to the hospital. I'll fucking paranoid. You smoke something. You're like who smoked something? Who? It wasn't me. I swear. Yeah, I swear to God. I've never let them smoke anything. But you know, I just, I fucking never like leave that like this far away from the area. But like, I fucking who's to know this shit would happen today. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I was gonna say you could have been at work too. But like, at least I could leave. But yeah, that's just crazy. Like, I thought she was she was like, Oh, Rochester new place new me. I'm not like, well, and I just found out last night, I was gonna call you guys talked about it today. Because fucking Ashton told me that when Corey came over, I think like one of the first times he had a bunch of fucking vapes. And one like five of them. And I guess when Ella was trying to get Milo underneath my bed, she like found one and took it. And so she's had that too. And I'm like, What the fuck are you doing? Are yellow? Like, she was doing she's been doing like good. You know what I mean? And like, I get that. It's gonna be fucking like, slip ups and shit that happens. But like, I just don't even know what to do with extracurricular activities, because I get a job. Yeah, I've been stuck at the house unemployed, and I'm fucking bored. Right? Like, yeah, and I mean, I don't know, Ava. She applied at Chick fil A. And then she, she just asked me yesterday, she wants to do this thing called sack. And I guess it would be after school. And in the summer, she would go to the elementary school and help like take care of the kids and like work with them and stuff. But it's not like a paying job. It's like a volunteer thing. But honestly, I, I think it just I would have to figure it out like transportation wise, because like most nights I work and she would have to be able to get home and home and stuff. Right? So I got it. We got to talk about that. But either way, she wants to get a car. She needs to get a job. Right? Do they not like a shuttle system in Rochester? They mean they have a bus system. Yeah. It's not like it's super complicated. Rochester is like a big fucking circle. Right? Well, yeah, wondering if they had like specific shuttles because we have ones here and you call and you can like make set appointments. Like I've had them take the girls to school and pick them up. Is it like what do they just use like your insurance? Or do you pay for it or what? Yeah, you pay for it. But it's like $1.50 a ride. Yeah, I could look and actually they do have that. I need to remember what it's called. I was gonna do that before I got my car and license and stuff. But yeah, it's like not very much but Do something outside of herself and Ella too. She needs to get a job and stop fucking around and if that's what it takes. I'm like, I told them either they need to be like in sports or like some sort of extracurricular or get a job because they all this extra time on their hands is not good. Right. Just makes you want to do drugs. Right. Fucking understandable. I'm fucking I'm on that wave right now, bro. I'm like, dude, I'm unemployed. I don't got a car. Fucking whack. Why is Brandon always using your car? Yeah, Brandon's always going to work. He has a job. Yeah. I mean, that's good. At least one of you guys does now. I know, right? Well, we're taking turns, I guess. Yeah, whatever works. Right. But yeah, well, I guess this Sunday, we can have a very good teachable moment. Like what did we learn? Yeah, this Sunday, it needs to happen regardless of anyone's feelings or whatever. Right. And I know the girls like miss you guys and they talk about like missing the boys and want to see you guys. I know. They texted me about it and I'm like, well, I want to say yes, but like, I'm not saying dad's saying no, but it's not always up to me. Well, regardless, dad needs to put aside his feelings, too, because this shit needs to stop. They need to quit fucking being mad at each other. I tell them the same thing, the girls. Right. Well, I don't think he's so much of a dude anymore, are you? Life is too short to be fucking holding grudges over shit that's not fucking that deep. Like, I mean, it is, but you know what I mean? Right. Well, more of a miscommunication. Right. Exactly. And they're all just everyone's all butthurt. It's crazy when you see the similarities and personalities when shit like this comes up. Exactly. Yeah, the apple don't fall too far from the tree. We're chill. We get it. Right. Right. Okay, hold on. A call is calling me. I gotta let you go. All right. Bye. All right. Bye.",

She was in the gym or no, I don't even know if she was in the gym or not, but now let's look at the transcripts. Yeah, she called me at 1130 at 1130 and I see what she said. Yeah, so I mean, we want to let you know what was going on basically she passed out or fainted and you know, I guess it was significant enough that you know teachers and staff got like involved and she wasn't like very responsive right away so they decided to have her transported like they tried to call Kiana and they got a hold of her but like she can is like an hour and a half away or she was at the time. Yes, I'm pretty sure she was dropping Corey off. Yeah. Right. Yeah, yeah, she was dropping Corey off. And then when all that she got that call, she he just ended up coming back with her anyways. Um, interesting. But yeah, I guess like, we, we kind of like first assumed like I mean, when somebody faints, I mean, it's only so many things that I could be. I was like, you're not like been eating lately or feel like not drinking water at all. Because like, I can see like that. That's like, that shit happens when you're like, kind of low on any of those things and you're like working out. You can find like veins. But then, I don't know, we're like, yeah, naturally, like, it was likely that she probably just smoked some weed and with somebody and, and, you know, got too fucked up. Right. How did she even like? How did? Well, I mean, I guess that's how she found out it was laced. I mean, she fainted, but like, like, what even happened? So she fainted. Teachers were like, checking on her, and she wasn't super responsive. So they're like, okay, let's get her to a hospital. And then, like, is that basically it? Yeah. They called mom to have her come and get her. But when they found out that mom wasn't going to be like, read it, like, readily available right now. And like, since she wasn't responsive, they decided to just have her brought there in an ambulance. And, uh, and I guess at some point between here and oh, and I think Kiana did send somebody to go pick her up. But I don't know, it sounded like a cat name. Whoever. Hello. Yeah, yeah, she sounds like a like a brindle or something. I don't know, some sort of dog or cat. But anyways. I mean, have you and mom talked at all? I mean, like, what does this mean for Ella? Um, I don't know. Like, I see, like, it like, told somebody like, well, yeah, so I was gonna say that so since mom wasn't available to go pick her up, and I think the guidance counselor ended up riding with her to the hospital. So, you know, she wasn't like by herself. Yeah. And yeah, that's about all I got. Yeah, I'm not really super big on I told you so is because I think they're kind of offensive. But yeah, I know that I'm big on I told you so is I thought I told I told Ella like, like, you're a dumbass and it was bound to happen. I'm pretty sure I had this exact talk with her, maybe like two or three weeks ago. And I'm like, if you guys like keep doing this, like eventually someone's going to give you laced shit, and then you're going to end up like, so like something bad's gonna happen. I like, I don't. I mean, like, what I kind of meant by like, what? Like, what does this mean for Ella? I kind of meant in terms of like, have you and mom talked about, like having her move back up with you guys? Or like her going online down here? I don't know, me and mom talked the other day about like, potential changes. And this thing is that, like, our thing is that we're willing to change and things that we want to, like, improve on and stuff like that. But yeah, that's as far as the conversation got. I was like, basically, I called her the other day. And I told her, I was like, Yeah, I think I'm going to be coming to get the kids the next time I see him. And he's like, why? Why do you say that? We talked about it. And we're fine. Basically, we're going to communicate better than we have been. Because mom hasn't really, I don't know, mom hasn't really used me as an asset as of lately, which is a problem for me. Right. But as far as we got. Right, right. I think it would be beneficial to have another conversation with mom after we get Ella all situated about what to do with Ella. Because I think it's kind of obvious school isn't really working out. I mean, like, as well as we hoped. I mean, Ella told me that she's going online. And I'm like, um, okay. I don't really know if that's something she talked to you guys about. Or if you guys have even talked to her at all. Right. Is Gabby with you? No. Nope. Where are you right now? Driving my way to work. Hmm. Are you going to St. Cloud? Yeah. I see. I might have to go to the city is like, tonight or tomorrow. I'm not sure why. Are you asking me why, as in why? Why do I want to know? Yeah, I know. I was what do you got going on? Um, nothing much, I guess. I mean, I don't know. I'm kind of I've kind of been talking to people and, you know, I'm not sure why, but I'm not sure what's going on. I don't know. I I'm I've kind of been talking to people and trying to figure out if I have plans this weekend, and it kind of seems like I don't, but I think if I don't this weekend, I might have, I might do next weekend. Next weekend. What are you talking about? With like with like Brandon and Vega and Vega's boyfriend and like Brandon's friend group type of thing. Yeah. When was the last time you seen them? Like, it was like two weeks ago or something. Yeah, yeah, I think I've seen them all. Well, not last week. I found out that I was driving home from work one night and I seen some like blue car like in the ditch, which is not like, you know, super like like a big deal. But it was like that first night that it was like just extremely cold. It was like, I don't know, like 18 below or 20 below or some shit like that. It was like 22 below down here. Yeah. Well, I was driving home from work one night and I think it was about like 11 o'clock. I was leaving the area and I seen this blue fucking car in the ditch probably like 30 feet off the road and like it didn't have anybody around it, but like it had like a left like the left blinker was like just blinking. And yeah, I don't know. It was one of those scenarios where like I considered like stopping and like going and checking on the person. But then like I figured like, OK, well, maybe like they already got helps and they're like, you know, already been picked up and they just abandoned the car. But just to be safe, I called 9-1-1 and I just kept driving because I had just seen a cop like I just passed a cop probably like a half mile back and I told him, yeah, like, you know, somebody is on the side of the road, you know, you might not sure if they got help, you know, go check it out, whatever. And they're like, OK, yeah, no, they'll do that. And then and then the next day I'm going about my day like regular and one of my clients sits down in my car and he's like, my nephew just was just found dead. And I'm like, oh, shit, like I'm sorry to hear that. And and he's like, yeah, he froze to death and full and they found him like in the woods, like frozen to death right in Foley. I was like right in Foley like that's you mean like right after 23? He's like, yeah. And I couldn't get really much details at the time, but that's when I was like, dude, I seen a vehicle in the ditch last night and called the cops when I seen. And yeah, basically, we found out I found out more of the story since then. But I guess like his nephew and his girlfriend were someplace, I don't know if they're at home or at a party or something like that, but they were drinking and they all like, well, he him and his girlfriend decided to leave despite everybody telling him not to that he'd been drinking and they left anyways. And what I found out later is that they, you know, he got he went off the road and he couldn't get himself out of there. Of course, but the girlfriend ended up like getting out of the car and, you know, walking a little ways before and somebody came and picked her up. And so basically, she left him at the car. And then I think he eventually tried to do the same thing, but nobody ever picked him up. And yeah, that's yeah, pretty much it. I'm going to his funeral on a couple of days. Yeah, I mean, I bet the girlfriend feels like horrible, right? Yeah, I mean, she probably feels like she like left him to die. Yeah. But like, I feel like in like a time like that. I mean, she had to probably think that the same thing was going to happen to him. Like he was going to end up getting picked up also. Yeah, I'm really no telling like the dynamic that might have been going on. Like he may have been like fucking basically, he could have been like borderline toxic and abusive and verbally abusive. And I don't know, maybe she was just trying to get away. Like shouldn't have fucking left in the first place. And I don't know. But yeah, I don't know. Everybody that's kind of like a part of it, I guess it's kind of like, I don't know. I was questioned her even like somebody gave me a couple of questions. Like, what did you think? Did you think to stop or anything like that? And I was like, well, no, I didn't stop. But because I just passed a cop. And so I called 911. Yeah, but yeah. Yeah, I mean, they're pretty much especially if there's one thing that law enforcement is prepared to do on the night, on nights like those, it's going to rescue people. Yeah. So yeah, I don't know. Yeah, like, I guess that makes sense. I'm like, confused and like, I don't know, I think well, in terms of like Ella's situation, I think it's kind of like, I don't want to say self-inflicted, but you know what I'm getting at, hopefully. Right, right, and, you know, honestly, I feel like there's, there should be like some room for room for fucking error, like just because somebody like messes up, doesn't necessarily mean that we should like switch schools and move. Right. I feel like we should like talk to her. I think that if we talk to her and kind of just like, explain to her that it like, it's okay to make mistakes. But if you've been doing it longer than just like, to do it, then it's okay to make mistakes. And I think that's a good thing. But if you've been doing it longer than just like today, then I think it's important for like her to tell you guys. Like, I think if today has just been like a one day kind of slip up and that she's been clean up until now, and her stuff just so happened to be laced today. I think like, yeah, that's like, okay, so it was just a mess up and it was a bad time for a mess up. I think that's like important to kind of differentiate. I suppose. Yeah, I don't know what to fully do. I'm gonna have to think about it and kind of, because I don't know. You know, wisdom is the best wisdom. Are her grades good? Are you asking me if her grades are good? Yeah, I don't want to say yes, because I'm pretty sure the last time we talked about grades, she was failing like three classes. I think, I don't fully remember, but I think she was failing something. I don't remember how many or which, or I don't know. I feel like that should be something you're able to look at, though, like on the Skyward app, you're able to look at Ella's account and see her grades and stuff. I'm sure they're probably posted by now, yeah. Yeah, at Ashton's, I was able to get a bunch of her, all of her late assignments, like a printout of it. Yeah. I think, well, mom's at the hospital now, so I think it would be a good idea for, if before you get to work, to just maybe call one of the two of them. Why don't you just try a three-way call on her? Okay, I can add mom. Here, hold on, I'm going to put, okay, you're in a three-way right now with dad. Okay, hey, I was just about to call you. I just, I'm talking to Ella right now. But hold on, I'll put you on speaker so then you can talk to her too. All right, the dad, Ava, is on the phone. Oh no. Say hi. I know I told you this over text, but I don't, this is, this is kind of like one of those situations where it's like important for us to know that if this is like a one-time mess up or if you've been doing it longer than just now. Ava. Yeah, I appreciate your concern, but I think for now, just be her sister right now, okay? Yeah, yeah. I know you care and you're just worried about her like we are, but I think she just needs you to be there for her right now. This is a parole violation. I'm just kidding. Hold on, hold on, I thought that was a cop, but dad sounded like a fed. Dad sounded like a fed. So we're here. She's doing okay, like she's, all her vitals and everything are like normal. I think they're waiting for like some tests to come back for see what was in her system, but I don't think it was just weed from what she's, she was like hallucinating and like, yeah, her pupils are the size of saucers. And she's still definitely out of it right now. Yeah, she just keeps laughing and I know she's, this is just kind of crazy, but she can't even stop. It's crazy. Ella. Right. But yeah, her counselor was here until I got here and then they left. And I asked her, I'm going to be calling the school tomorrow and setting up an appointment to meet with her counselor. And I don't know, maybe we can do it through zoom for you, Brandon, to be there as well. And just kind of see if we can get on the same page and talk about these bathroom situations and all that. And just, yeah, there's some stuff going on there that we need to all discuss, but I think me and you should probably talk later tonight. I'm not going into work tonight. I already called off. So I'll be here with her. Are you okay? You're twitching. Um, do you have anything you want to say to her, Brandon? Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're okay, Ella. You know, I love you. I'm sorry that this sort of thing has to happen. I know it can be very traumatic and I just know that we're here for you and we love you and I hope that you get better. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to be completely honest right now. I don't, I didn't understand a single thing that she just said. Yeah. Just said something about TP. She said something about CC pizzeria. That she was telling me that she wanted to dab me up or something. I thought she was talking about like toilet paper abbreviated. Yeah, I don't know. So we're here. I'm going to, what time is it? I'm probably going to see if Akalo can just pick up Ashton from school if we're not done here. Because she said she would, like just to keep her updated and she'll pick her up, pick up Ashton if she need be. I talked to Ashton already too. She like knows what's going on and she was crying at first, a little scared, but I told her everything's okay and that Ella's going to be fine. Yeah, Ashton texted me and she's like Ava and I texted her back and I'm like, like, hmm, like what's up? And she didn't text me back. So yeah, that's when Ella texted me and she said that she was in the hospital and I'm like, um, okay. So I'm a little confused. And then Ella said that someone, Ella said this really weird. She said someone laced her weed. Not even laced, leased her weed. Sold it to her? Yeah, she said someone. Like she rented it? Someone leased it? Yeah, she's renting it out. She said, I leased on my weed. Yeah, I don't think she pulled someone laced her weed. And she said, yes, gang. So when I didn't get enough answers, that's when I decided, well, I tried to call Gabby and I'm like, I was, I tried to call Gabby first because I thought maybe dad talked to Gabby and then Gabby didn't answer me. So then I called dad. Yeah, I would have called you, but I was on the phone between dad, the school, the hospital, Kahlo, my work, trying to like get all this stuff sorted out. So I just, I knew that somebody would talk to you. Can we do a video call quick? Yeah, this would be a lot easier if you just had an iPhone. Well, just do that.",
